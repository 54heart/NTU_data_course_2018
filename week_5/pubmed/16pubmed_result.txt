CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity by employing short DNA
sequences, termed spacers, that guide Cas proteins to cleave foreign DNA. Class 2
CRISPR-Cas systems are streamlined versions, in which a single RNA-bound Cas
protein recognizes and cleaves target sequences. The programmable nature of these
minimal systems has enabled researchers to repurpose them into a versatile
technology that is broadly revolutionizing biological and clinical research.
However, current CRISPR-Cas technologies are based solely on systems from
isolated bacteria, leaving the vast majority of enzymes from organisms that have 
not been cultured untapped. Metagenomics, the sequencing of DNA extracted
directly from natural microbial communities, provides access to the genetic
material of a huge array of uncultivated organisms. Here, using genome-resolved
metagenomics, we identify a number of CRISPR-Cas systems, including the first
reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life, to our knowledge. This divergent
Cas9 protein was found in little-studied nanoarchaea as part of an active
CRISPR-Cas system. In bacteria, we discovered two previously unknown systems,
CRISPR-CasX and CRISPR-CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet
discovered. Notably, all required functional components were identified by
metagenomics, enabling validation of robust in vivo RNA-guided DNA interference
activity in Escherichia coli. Interrogation of environmental microbial
communities combined with in vivo experiments allows us to access an
unprecedented diversity of genomes, the content of which will expand the
repertoire of microbe-based biotechnologies.

Lymphatic vessels are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and are
critical for health. However, the role of metabolism in lymphatic development has
not yet been elucidated. Here we report that in transgenic mouse models,
LEC-specific loss of CPT1A, a rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation, 
impairs lymphatic development. LECs use fatty acid β-oxidation to proliferate and
for epigenetic regulation of lymphatic marker expression during LEC
differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor PROX1 upregulates
CPT1A expression, which increases acetyl coenzyme A production dependent on fatty
acid β-oxidation. Acetyl coenzyme A is used by the histone acetyltransferase p300
to acetylate histones at lymphangiogenic genes. PROX1-p300 interaction
facilitates preferential histone acetylation at PROX1-target genes. Through this 
metabolism-dependent mechanism, PROX1 mediates epigenetic changes that promote
lymphangiogenesis. Notably, blockade of CPT1 enzymes inhibits injury-induced
lymphangiogenesis, and replenishing acetyl coenzyme A by supplementing acetate
rescues this process in vivo.

Engineered spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in cold-atom systems can enable the study of
new synthetic materials and complex condensed matter phenomena. However,
spontaneous emission in alkali-atom spin-orbit-coupled systems is hindered by
heating, limiting the observation of many-body effects and motivating research
into potential alternatives. Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit-coupled fermions
can be engineered to occur naturally in a one-dimensional optical lattice clock. 
In contrast to previous SOC experiments, here the SOC is both generated and
probed using a direct ultra-narrow optical clock transition between two
electronic orbital states in 87Sr atoms. We use clock spectroscopy to prepare
lattice band populations, internal electronic states and quasi-momenta, and to
produce spin-orbit-coupled dynamics. The exceptionally long lifetime of the
excited clock state (160 seconds) eliminates decoherence and atom loss from
spontaneous emission at all relevant experimental timescales, allowing subsequent
momentum- and spin-resolved in situ probing of the SOC band structure and
eigenstates. We use these capabilities to study Bloch oscillations, spin-momentum
locking and Van Hove singularities in the transition density of states. Our
results lay the groundwork for using fermionic optical lattice clocks to probe
new phases of matter.

The spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a central part in fundamental
physics over the past 200 years. Historical examples of its importance include
the wavelength measurements of absorption lines in the solar spectrum by
Fraunhofer, the identification of transition lines by Balmer, Lyman and others,
the empirical description of allowed wavelengths by Rydberg, the quantum model of
Bohr, the capability of quantum electrodynamics to precisely predict transition
frequencies, and modern measurements of the 1S-2S transition by Hänsch to a
precision of a few parts in 1015. Recent technological advances have allowed us
to focus on antihydrogen-the antimatter equivalent of hydrogen. The Standard
Model predicts that there should have been equal amounts of matter and antimatter
in the primordial Universe after the Big Bang, but today's Universe is observed
to consist almost entirely of ordinary matter. This motivates the study of
antimatter, to see if there is a small asymmetry in the laws of physics that
govern the two types of matter. In particular, the CPT (charge conjugation,
parity reversal and time reversal) theorem, a cornerstone of the Standard Model, 
requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Here we report
the observation of the 1S-2S transition in magnetically trapped atoms of
antihydrogen. We determine that the frequency of the transition, which is driven 
by two photons from a laser at 243 nanometres, is consistent with that expected
for hydrogen in the same environment. This laser excitation of a quantum state of
an atom of antimatter represents the most precise measurement performed on an
anti-atom. Our result is consistent with CPT invariance at a relative precision
of about 2 × 10-10.

CLC proteins transport chloride (Cl-) ions across cellular membranes to regulate 
muscle excitability, electrolyte movement across epithelia, and acidification of 
intracellular organelles. Some CLC proteins are channels that conduct Cl- ions
passively, whereas others are secondary active transporters that exchange two Cl-
ions for one H+. The structural basis underlying these distinctive transport
mechanisms is puzzling because CLC channels and transporters are expected to
share the same architecture on the basis of sequence homology. Here we determined
the structure of a bovine CLC channel (CLC-K) using cryo-electron microscopy. A
conserved loop in the Cl- transport pathway shows a structure markedly different 
from that of CLC transporters. Consequently, the cytosolic constriction for Cl-
passage is widened in CLC-K such that the kinetic barrier previously postulated
for Cl-/H+ transporter function would be reduced. Thus, reduction of a kinetic
barrier in CLC channels enables fast flow of Cl- down its electrochemical
gradient.

In bacteria, ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs that lack a stop codon are
rescued by the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), alternative rescue factor A (ArfA)
or ArfB systems. Although tmRNA-ribosome and ArfB-ribosome structures have been
determined, how ArfA recognizes the presence of truncated mRNAs and recruits the 
canonical termination release factor RF2 to rescue the stalled ribosomes is
unclear. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the
Escherichia coli 70S ribosome stalled on a truncated mRNA in the presence of ArfA
and RF2. The structure shows that the C terminus of ArfA binds within the mRNA
entry channel on the small ribosomal subunit, and explains how ArfA distinguishes
between ribosomes that bear truncated or full-length mRNAs. The N terminus of
ArfA establishes several interactions with the decoding domain of RF2, and this
finding illustrates how ArfA recruits RF2 to the stalled ribosome. Furthermore,
ArfA is shown to stabilize a unique conformation of the switch loop of RF2, which
mimics the canonical translation termination state by directing the catalytically
important GGQ motif within domain 3 of RF2 towards the peptidyl-transferase
centre of the ribosome. Thus, our structure reveals not only how ArfA recruits
RF2 to the ribosome but also how it promotes an active conformation of RF2 to
enable translation termination in the absence of a stop codon.

During cellular translation of messenger RNAs by ribosomes, the translation
apparatus sometimes pauses or stalls at the elongation and termination steps.
With the exception of programmed stalling, which is usually used by cells for
regulatory purposes, ribosomes stalled on mRNAs need to be terminated and
recycled to maintain adequate translation capacity. Much ribosome stalling
originates in aberrant mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Transcriptional errors,
misprocessing of primary transcripts, and undesired mRNA cleavage all contribute 
to the formation of non-stop mRNAs. Ribosomes stalled at the 3' end of non-stop
mRNAs do not undergo normal termination owing to the lack of specific stop-codon 
recognition by canonical peptide release factors at the A-site decoding centre.
In bacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)-SmpB-mediated trans-translation
rescue system reroutes stalled ribosomes to the normal elongation cycle and
translation termination. Two additional rescue systems, ArfA-RF2 (refs 13, 14,
15, 16) and ArfB (formerly known as YaeJ), are also present in many bacterial
species, but their mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, using cryo-electron
microscopy, we characterize the structure of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome
bound with ArfA, the release factor RF2, a short non-stop mRNA and a cognate
P-site tRNA. The C-terminal loop of ArfA occupies the mRNA entry channel on the
30S subunit, whereas its N terminus is sandwiched between the decoding centre and
the switch loop of RF2, leading to marked conformational changes in both the
decoding centre and RF2. Despite the distinct conformation of RF2, its conserved 
catalytic GGQ motif is precisely positioned next to the CCA-end of the P-site
tRNA. These data illustrate a stop-codon surrogate mechanism for ArfA in
facilitating the termination of non-stop ribosomal complexes by RF2.

Embryonic development is driven by tightly regulated patterns of gene expression,
despite extensive genetic variation among individuals. Studies of expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) indicate that genetic variation frequently alters 
gene expression in cell-culture models and differentiated tissues. However, the
extent and types of genetic variation impacting embryonic gene expression, and
their interactions with developmental programs, remain largely unknown. Here we
assessed the effect of genetic variation on transcriptional (expression levels)
and post-transcriptional (3' RNA processing) regulation across multiple stages of
metazoan development, using 80 inbred Drosophila wild isolates, identifying
thousands of developmental-stage-specific and shared QTL. Given the small blocks 
of linkage disequilibrium in Drosophila, we obtain near base-pair resolution,
resolving causal mutations in developmental enhancers, validated
transcription-factor-binding sites and RNA motifs. This fine-grain mapping
uncovered extensive allelic interactions within enhancers that have opposite
effects, thereby buffering their impact on enhancer activity. QTL affecting 3'
RNA processing identify new functional motifs leading to transcript isoform
diversity and changes in the lengths of 3' untranslated regions. These results
highlight how developmental stage influences the effects of genetic variation and
uncover multiple mechanisms that regulate and buffer expression variation during 
embryogenesis.

Internal bases in mRNA can be subjected to modifications that influence the fate 
of mRNA in cells. One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5' end
of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap.
Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a
reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a
transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are
markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. We show that
the enhanced stability of m6Am-initiated transcripts is due to resistance to the 
mRNA-decapping enzyme DCP2. Moreover, we find that m6Am is selectively
demethylated by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). FTO preferentially
demethylates m6Am rather than N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and reduces the stability
of m6Am mRNAs. Together, these findings show that the methylation status of m6Am 
in the 5' cap is a dynamic and reversible epitranscriptomic modification that
determines mRNA stability.

The macronutrient phosphorus is thought to limit primary productivity in the
oceans on geological timescales. Although there has been a sustained effort to
reconstruct the dynamics of the phosphorus cycle over the past 3.5 billion years,
it remains uncertain whether phosphorus limitation persisted throughout Earth's
history and therefore whether the phosphorus cycle has consistently modulated
biospheric productivity and ocean-atmosphere oxygen levels over time. Here we
present a compilation of phosphorus abundances in marine sedimentary rocks
spanning the past 3.5 billion years. We find evidence for relatively low
authigenic phosphorus burial in shallow marine environments until about 800 to
700 million years ago. Our interpretation of the database leads us to propose
that limited marginal phosphorus burial before that time was linked to phosphorus
biolimitation, resulting in elemental stoichiometries in primary producers that
diverged strongly from the Redfield ratio (the atomic ratio of carbon, nitrogen
and phosphorus found in phytoplankton). We place our phosphorus record in a
quantitative biogeochemical model framework and find that a combination of
enhanced phosphorus scavenging in anoxic, iron-rich oceans and a nutrient-based
bistability in atmospheric oxygen levels could have resulted in a stable
low-oxygen world. The combination of these factors may explain the protracted
oxygenation of Earth's surface over the last 3.5 billion years of Earth history. 
However, our analysis also suggests that a fundamental shift in the phosphorus
cycle may have occurred during the late Proterozoic eon (between 800 and 635
million years ago), coincident with a previously inferred shift in marine redox
states, severe perturbations to Earth's climate system, and the emergence of
animals.

Ash trees (genus Fraxinus, family Oleaceae) are widespread throughout the
Northern Hemisphere, but are being devastated in Europe by the fungus
Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, causing ash dieback, and in North America by the
herbivorous beetle Agrilus planipennis. Here we sequence the genome of a
low-heterozygosity Fraxinus excelsior tree from Gloucestershire, UK, annotating
38,852 protein-coding genes of which 25% appear ash specific when compared with
the genomes of ten other plant species. Analyses of paralogous genes suggest a
whole-genome duplication shared with olive (Olea europaea, Oleaceae). We also
re-sequence 37 F. excelsior trees from Europe, finding evidence for apparent
long-term decline in effective population size. Using our reference sequence, we 
re-analyse association transcriptomic data, yielding improved markers for reduced
susceptibility to ash dieback. Surveys of these markers in British populations
suggest that reduced susceptibility to ash dieback may be more widespread in
Great Britain than in Denmark. We also present evidence that susceptibility of
trees to H. fraxineus is associated with their iridoid glycoside levels. This
rapid, integrated, multidisciplinary research response to an emerging health
threat in a non-model organism opens the way for mitigation of the epidemic.

Chromatin structure at the length scale encompassing local nucleosome-nucleosome 
interactions is thought to play a crucial role in regulating transcription and
access to DNA. However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly
understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the
tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first
genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1-3 nucleosome
(50-500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated
cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA-DNA contacts that are 
spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional
enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent
nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked
heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome-nucleosome 
contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed
chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional
distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked
alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from 
H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures
are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin
architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal
compaction of two-start helical fibres.

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts by
definition, recent studies have shown that a fraction of putative small open
reading frames within lncRNAs are translated. However, the biological
significance of these hidden polypeptides is still unclear. Here we identify and 
functionally characterize a novel polypeptide encoded by the lncRNA LINC00961.
This polypeptide is conserved between human and mouse, is localized to the late
endosome/lysosome and interacts with the lysosomal v-ATPase to negatively
regulate mTORC1 activation. This regulation of mTORC1 is specific to activation
of mTORC1 by amino acid stimulation, rather than by growth factors. Hence, we
termed this polypeptide 'small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response'
(SPAR). We show that the SPAR-encoding lncRNA is highly expressed in a subset of 
tissues and use CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to develop a SPAR-polypeptide-specific
knockout mouse while maintaining expression of the host lncRNA. We find that the 
SPAR-encoding lncRNA is downregulated in skeletal muscle upon acute injury, and
using this in vivo model we establish that SPAR downregulation enables efficient 
activation of mTORC1 and promotes muscle regeneration. Our data provide a
mechanism by which mTORC1 activation may be finely regulated in a tissue-specific
manner in response to injury, and a paradigm by which lncRNAs encoding small
polypeptides can modulate general biological pathways and processes to facilitate
tissue-specific requirements, consistent with their restricted and highly
regulated expression profile.

Respiratory dysfunction is a notorious cause of perinatal mortality in infants
and sleep apnoea in adults, but the mechanisms of respiratory control are not
clearly understood. Mechanical signals transduced by airway-innervating sensory
neurons control respiration; however, the physiological significance and
molecular mechanisms of these signals remain obscured. Here we show that global
and sensory neuron-specific ablation of the mechanically activated ion channel
Piezo2 causes respiratory distress and death in newborn mice. Optogenetic
activation of Piezo2+ vagal sensory neurons causes apnoea in adult mice.
Moreover, induced ablation of Piezo2 in sensory neurons of adult mice causes
decreased neuronal responses to lung inflation, an impaired Hering-Breuer
mechanoreflex, and increased tidal volume under normal conditions. These
phenotypes are reproduced in mice lacking Piezo2 in the nodose ganglion. Our data
suggest that Piezo2 is an airway stretch sensor and that Piezo2-mediated
mechanotransduction within various airway-innervating sensory neurons is critical
for establishing efficient respiration at birth and maintaining normal breathing 
in adults.

Aromatic and antiaromatic ring currents in a molecular nanoring.

Aromatic and antiaromatic molecules-which have delocalized circuits of [4n + 2]
or [4n] electrons, respectively-exhibit ring currents around their perimeters.
The direction of the ring current in an aromatic molecule is such as to generate 
a magnetic field that opposes the external field inside the ring (a 'diatropic'
current), while the ring current in an antiaromatic molecule flows in the reverse
direction ('paratropic'). Similar persistent currents occur in metal or
semiconductor rings, when the phase coherence of the electronic wavefunction is
preserved around the ring. Persistent currents in non-molecular rings switch
direction as a function of the magnetic flux passing through the ring, so that
they can be changed from diatropic ('aromatic') to paratropic ('antiaromatic')
simply by changing the external magnetic field. As in molecular systems, the
direction of the persistent current also depends on the number of electrons. The 
relationship between ring currents in molecular and non-molecular rings is poorly
understood, partly because they are studied in different size regimes: the
largest aromatic molecules have diameters of about one nanometre, whereas
persistent currents are observed in microfabricated rings with diameters of
20-1,000 nanometres. Understanding the connection between aromaticity and
quantum-coherence effects in mesoscopic rings provides a motivation for
investigating ring currents in molecules of an intermediate size. Here we show,
using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory, that
a six-porphyrin nanoring template complex, with a diameter of 2.4 nanometres, is 
antiaromatic in its 4+ oxidation state (80 π electrons) and aromatic in its 6+
oxidation state (78 π electrons). The antiaromatic state has a huge paramagnetic 
susceptibility, despite having no unpaired electrons. This work demonstrates that
a global ring current can be promoted in a macrocycle by adjusting its oxidation 
state to suppress the local ring currents of its components.The discovery of ring
currents around a molecule with a circumference of 7.5 nanometres, at room
temperature, shows that quantum coherence can persist in surprisingly large
molecular frameworks.

Riboswitches are structural RNA elements that are generally located in the 5'
untranslated region of messenger RNA. During regulation of gene expression,
ligand binding to the aptamer domain of a riboswitch triggers a signal to the
downstream expression platform. A complete understanding of the structural basis 
of this mechanism requires the ability to study structural changes over time.
Here we use femtosecond X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses to obtain
structural measurements from crystals so small that diffusion of a ligand can be 
timed to initiate a reaction before diffraction. We demonstrate this approach by 
determining four structures of the adenine riboswitch aptamer domain during the
course of a reaction, involving two unbound apo structures, one ligand-bound
intermediate, and the final ligand-bound conformation. These structures support a
reaction mechanism model with at least four states and illustrate the structural 
basis of signal transmission. The three-way junction and the P1 switch helix of
the two apo conformers are notably different from those in the ligand-bound
conformation. Our time-resolved crystallographic measurements with a 10-second
delay captured the structure of an intermediate with changes in the binding
pocket that accommodate the ligand. With at least a 10-minute delay, the RNA
molecules were fully converted to the ligand-bound state, in which the
substantial conformational changes resulted in conversion of the space group.
Such notable changes in crystallo highlight the important opportunities that
micro- and nanocrystals may offer in these and similar time-resolved diffraction 
studies. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of 'mix-and-inject'
time-resolved serial crystallography to study biochemically important
interactions between biomacromolecules and ligands, including those that involve 
large conformational changes.

The adult mammalian heart is incapable of regeneration following cardiomyocyte
loss, which underpins the lasting and severe effects of cardiomyopathy. Recently,
it has become clear that the mammalian heart is not a post-mitotic organ. For
example, the neonatal heart is capable of regenerating lost myocardium, and the
adult heart is capable of modest self-renewal. In both of these scenarios,
cardiomyocyte renewal occurs via the proliferation of pre-existing
cardiomyocytes, and is regulated by aerobic-respiration-mediated oxidative DNA
damage. Therefore, we reasoned that inhibiting aerobic respiration by inducing
systemic hypoxaemia would alleviate oxidative DNA damage, thereby inducing
cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult mammals. Here we report that, in mice,
gradual exposure to severe systemic hypoxaemia, in which inspired oxygen is
gradually decreased by 1% and maintained at 7% for 2 weeks, results in inhibition
of oxidative metabolism, decreased reactive oxygen species production and
oxidative DNA damage, and reactivation of cardiomyocyte mitosis. Notably, we find
that exposure to hypoxaemia 1 week after induction of myocardial infarction
induces a robust regenerative response with decreased myocardial fibrosis and
improvement of left ventricular systolic function. Genetic fate-mapping analysis 
confirms that the newly formed myocardium is derived from pre-existing
cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that the endogenous regenerative
properties of the adult mammalian heart can be reactivated by exposure to gradual
systemic hypoxaemia, and highlight the potential therapeutic role of hypoxia in
regenerative medicine.

Phosphorus is an important nutrient for crop productivity. More than 60% of the
total phosphorus in cereal crops is finally allocated into the grains and is
therefore removed at harvest. This removal accounts for 85% of the phosphorus
fertilizers applied to the field each year. However, because humans and
non-ruminants such as poultry, swine and fish cannot digest phytate, the major
form of phosphorus in the grains, the excreted phosphorus causes eutrophication
of waterways. A reduction in phosphorus accumulation in the grain would
contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. Here we
describe a rice transporter, SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter
(SPDT), that controls the allocation of phosphorus to the grain. SPDT is
expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of
the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus.
Knockout of this gene in rice (Oryza sativa) altered the distribution of
phosphorus, with decreased phosphorus in the grains but increased levels in the
leaves. Total phosphorus and phytate in the brown de-husked rice were 20-30%
lower in the knockout lines, whereas yield, seed germination and seedling vigour 
were not affected. These results indicate that SPDT functions in the rice node as
a switch to allocate phosphorus preferentially to the grains. This finding
provides a potential strategy to reduce the removal of phosphorus from the field 
and lower the risk of eutrophication of waterways.

Monocytes and macrophages comprise a variety of subsets with diverse functions.
It is thought that these cells play a crucial role in homeostasis of peripheral
organs, key immunological processes and development of various diseases. Among
these diseases, fibrosis is a life-threatening disease of unknown aetiology. Its 
pathogenesis is poorly understood, and there are few effective therapies. The
development of fibrosis is associated with activation of monocytes and
macrophages. However, the specific subtypes of monocytes and macrophages that are
involved in fibrosis have not yet been identified. Here we show that
Ceacam1+Msr1+Ly6C-F4/80-Mac1+ monocytes, which we term
segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocytes (SatM), share granulocyte
characteristics, are regulated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and 
are critical for fibrosis. Cebpb deficiency results in a complete lack of SatM.
Furthermore, the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, but not inflammation,
was prevented in chimaeric mice with Cebpb-/- haematopoietic cells. Adoptive
transfer of SatM into Cebpb-/- mice resulted in fibrosis. Notably, SatM are
derived from Ly6C-FcεRI+ granulocyte/macrophage progenitors, and a newly
identified SatM progenitor downstream of Ly6C-FcεRI+ granulocyte/macrophage
progenitors, but not from macrophage/dendritic-cell progenitors. Our results show
that SatM are critical for fibrosis and that C/EBPβ licenses differentiation of
SatM from their committed progenitor.

Approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide are overweight or affected by obesity,
and are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and related
metabolic and inflammatory disturbances. Although the mechanisms linking
adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies
suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation, a key regulator of gene
expression and molecular phenotype. Here we use epigenome-wide association to
show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with
widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P < 1 × 10-7, range 
P = 9.2 × 10-8 to 6.0 × 10-46; n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses 
demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the
consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci
are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P < 0.05), and 
show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 
loci (P < 9.0 × 10-6, range P = 5.5 × 10-6 to 6.1 × 10-35, n = 1,785 samples).
The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism,
substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the
disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes
(relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3
(2.07-2.56); P = 1.1 × 10-54). Our results provide new insights into the biologic
pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies
for prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes and other adverse clinical
consequences of obesity.

XRCC1 is a molecular scaffold protein that assembles multi-protein complexes
involved in DNA single-strand break repair. Here we show that biallelic mutations
in the human XRCC1 gene are associated with ocular motor apraxia, axonal
neuropathy, and progressive cerebellar ataxia. Cells from a patient with
mutations in XRCC1 exhibited not only reduced rates of single-strand break repair
but also elevated levels of protein ADP-ribosylation. This latter phenotype is
recapitulated in a related syndrome caused by mutations in the XRCC1 partner
protein PNKP and implicates hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase/s as a
cause of cerebellar ataxia. Indeed, remarkably, genetic deletion of Parp1 rescued
normal cerebellar ADP-ribose levels and reduced the loss of cerebellar neurons
and ataxia in Xrcc1-defective mice, identifying a molecular mechanism by which
endogenous single-strand breaks trigger neuropathology. Collectively, these data 
establish the importance of XRCC1 protein complexes for normal neurological
function and identify PARP1 as a therapeutic target in DNA strand break
repair-defective disease.

The heterotrimeric influenza polymerase (FluPol), comprising subunits PA, PB1 and
PB2, binds to the conserved 5' and 3' termini (the 'promoter') of each of the
eight single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments and performs both
transcription and replication of vRNA in the infected cell nucleus. To transcribe
viral mRNAs, FluPol associates with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which
enables it to take 5'-capped primers from nascent Pol II transcripts. Here we
present a co-crystal structure of bat influenza A polymerase bound to a Pol II
C-terminal domain (CTD) peptide mimic, which shows two distinct phosphoserine-5
(SeP5)-binding sites in the polymerase PA subunit, accommodating four CTD heptad 
repeats overall. Mutagenesis of the SeP5-contacting basic residues (PA K289,
R454, K635 and R638) weakens CTD repeat binding in vitro without affecting the
intrinsic cap-primed (transcription) or unprimed (replication) RNA synthesis
activity of recombinant polymerase, whereas in cell-based minigenome assays the
same mutations substantially reduce overall polymerase activity. Only recombinant
viruses with a single mutation in one of the SeP5-binding sites can be rescued,
but these viruses are severely attenuated and genetically unstable. Several
previously described mutants that modulate virulence can be rationalized by our
results, including a second site mutation (PA(C453R)) that enables the highly
attenuated mutant virus (PA(R638A)) to revert to near wild-type infectivity. We
conclude that direct binding of FluPol to the SeP5 Pol II CTD is fine-tuned to
allow efficient viral transcription and propose that the CTD-binding site on
FluPol could be targeted for antiviral drug development.

Packaging of the genome into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a 
host cell are two fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike
double-stranded DNA viruses, which pump their genome into a preformed capsid,
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble their
capsid with the genome; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly is
poorly understood. MS2 infects Escherichia coli via the host 'sex pilus'
(F-pilus); it was the first fully sequenced organism and is a model system for
studies of translational gene regulation, RNA-protein interactions, and RNA virus
assembly. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3,569 bases is enclosed in a capsid 
with one maturation protein monomer and 89 coat protein dimers arranged in a
T = 3 icosahedral lattice. The maturation protein is responsible for attaching
the virus to an F-pilus and delivering the viral genome into the host during
infection, but how the genome is organized and delivered is not known. Here we
describe the MS2 structure at 3.6 Å resolution, determined by electron-counting
cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction. We traced
approximately 80% of the backbone of the viral genome, built atomic models for 16
RNA stem-loops, and identified three conserved motifs of RNA-coat protein
interactions among 15 of these stem-loops with diverse sequences. The stem-loop
at the 3' end of the genome interacts extensively with the maturation protein,
which, with just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded β-sheet, forms a
genome-delivery apparatus and joins 89 coat protein dimers to form a capsid. This
atomic description of genome-capsid interactions in a spherical ssRNA virus
provides insight into genome delivery via the host sex pilus and mechanisms
underlying ssRNA-capsid co-assembly, and inspires speculation about the links
between nucleoprotein complexes and the origins of viruses.

'Blinking', or 'fluorescence intermittency', refers to a random switching between
'ON' (bright) and 'OFF' (dark) states of an emitter; it has been studied widely
in zero-dimensional quantum dots and molecules, and scarcely in one-dimensional
systems. A generally accepted mechanism for blinking in quantum dots involves
random switching between neutral and charged states (or is accompanied by
fluctuations in charge-carrier traps), which substantially alters the dynamics of
radiative and non-radiative decay. Here, we uncover a new type of blinking effect
in vertically stacked, two-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures, which
consist of two distinct monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
that are weakly coupled by van der Waals forces. Unlike zero-dimensional or
one-dimensional systems, two-dimensional TMD heterostructures show a correlated
blinking effect, comprising randomly switching bright, neutral and dark states.
Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy analyses show that a bright state
occurring in one monolayer will simultaneously lead to a dark state in the other 
monolayer, owing to an intermittent interlayer carrier-transfer process. Our
findings suggest that bilayer van der Waals heterostructures provide unique
platforms for the study of charge-transfer dynamics and non-equilibrium-state
physics, and could see application as correlated light emitters in quantum
technology.

The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial
for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is
regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane 
voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between
intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure 
from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the
Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per
subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These
conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through
covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring
and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly
connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate
gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors.

The Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo1, has an unusually large conductance and
contains a voltage sensor and multiple chemical sensors. Dual activation by
membrane voltage and Ca2+ renders Slo1 central to processes that couple
electrical signalling to Ca2+-mediated events such as muscle contraction and
neuronal excitability. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of 
a full-length Slo1 channel from Aplysia californica in the presence of Ca2+ and
Mg2+ at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The channel adopts an open conformation. Its
voltage-sensor domain adopts a non-domain-swapped attachment to the pore and
contacts the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding domain from a neighbouring subunit. Unique 
structural features of the Slo1 voltage sensor suggest that it undergoes
different conformational changes than other known voltage sensors. The structure 
reveals the molecular details of three distinct divalent cation-binding sites
identified through electrophysiological studies of mutant Slo1 channels.

The fact that the identity of the cells that initiate metastasis in most human
cancers is unknown hampers the development of antimetastatic therapies. Here we
describe a subpopulation of CD44bright cells in human oral carcinomas that do not
overexpress mesenchymal genes, are slow-cycling, express high levels of the fatty
acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes, and are unique in their ability to
initiate metastasis. Palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically boosts the
metastatic potential of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells in a CD36-dependent
manner. The use of neutralizing antibodies to block CD36 causes almost complete
inhibition of metastasis in immunodeficient or immunocompetent orthotopic mouse
models of human oral cancer, with no side effects. Clinically, the presence of
CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells correlates with a poor prognosis for numerous
types of carcinomas, and inhibition of CD36 also impairs metastasis, at least in 
human melanoma- and breast cancer-derived tumours. Together, our results indicate
that metastasis-initiating cells particularly rely on dietary lipids to promote
metastasis.

Proxy-based indicators of past climate change show that current global climate
models systematically underestimate Holocene-epoch climate variability on
centennial to multi-millennial timescales, with the mismatch increasing for
longer periods. Proposed explanations for the discrepancy include
ocean-atmosphere coupling that is too weak in models, insufficient energy
cascades from smaller to larger spatial and temporal scales, or that global
climate models do not consider slow climate feedbacks related to the carbon cycle
or interactions between ice sheets and climate. Such interactions, however, are
known to have strongly affected centennial- to orbital-scale climate variability 
during past glaciations, and are likely to be important in future climate change.
Here we show that fluctuations in Antarctic Ice Sheet discharge caused by
relatively small changes in subsurface ocean temperature can amplify
multi-centennial climate variability regionally and globally, suggesting that a
dynamic Antarctic Ice Sheet may have driven climate fluctuations during the
Holocene. We analysed high-temporal-resolution records of iceberg-rafted debris
derived from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and performed both high-spatial-resolution 
ice-sheet modelling of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and multi-millennial global
climate model simulations. Ice-sheet responses to decadal-scale ocean forcing
appear to be less important, possibly indicating that the future response of the 
Antarctic Ice Sheet will be governed more by long-term anthropogenic warming
combined with multi-centennial natural variability than by annual or decadal
climate oscillations.

Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis and is the 
key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or
reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to 
reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is
a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of 
the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses.
However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here
we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of
life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth
splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary
restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are
reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans
homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that
SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and 
by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. 
We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend
lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in
dietary restriction longevity and suggest that modulation of specific spliceosome
components may prolong healthy ageing.

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the largest potential sources of rising
sea levels. Over the past 40 years, glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea sector
of the ice sheet have thinned at an accelerating rate, and several numerical
models suggest that unstable and irreversible retreat of the grounding line-which
marks the boundary between grounded ice and floating ice shelf-is underway.
Understanding this recent retreat requires a detailed knowledge of grounding-line
history, but the locations of the grounding line before the advent of satellite
monitoring in the 1990s are poorly dated. In particular, a history of
grounding-line retreat is required to understand the relative roles of
contemporaneous ocean-forced change and of ongoing glacier response to an earlier
perturbation in driving ice-sheet loss. Here we show that the present thinning
and retreat of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is part of a climatically
forced trend that was triggered in the 1940s. Our conclusions arise from analysis
of sediment cores recovered beneath the floating Pine Island Glacier ice shelf,
and constrain the date at which the grounding line retreated from a prominent
seafloor ridge. We find that incursion of marine water beyond the crest of this
ridge, forming an ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf, occurred in 1945 (±12
years); final ungrounding of the ice shelf from the ridge occurred in 1970 (±4
years). The initial opening of this ocean cavity followed a period of strong
warming of West Antarctica, associated with El Niño activity. Thus our results
suggest that, even when climate forcing weakened, ice-sheet retreat continued.

Reconstructing the lineage relationships and dynamic event histories of
individual cells within their native spatial context is a long-standing challenge
in biology. Many biological processes of interest occur in optically opaque or
physically inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches other than direct
imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system that enables cells to record lineage
information and event histories in the genome in a format that can be
subsequently read out of single cells in situ. This system, termed memory by
engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout (MEMOIR), is based on a set
of barcoded recording elements termed scratchpads. The state of a given
scratchpad can be irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis,
and later read out in single cells through multiplexed single-molecule RNA
fluorescence hybridization (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we
engineered mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and other
recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were altered in a progressive
and stochastic fashion as the cells proliferated. Analysis of the final states of
scratchpads in single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage information
from cell colonies. Combining analysis of endogenous gene expression with lineage
reconstruction in the same cells further allowed inference of the dynamic rates
at which embryonic stem cells switch between two gene expression states. Finally,
using simulations, we show how parallel MEMOIR systems operating in the same cell
could enable recording and readout of dynamic cellular event histories. MEMOIR
thus provides a versatile platform for information recording and in situ,
single-cell readout across diverse biological systems.

Refractoriness to induction chemotherapy and relapse after achievement of
remission are the main obstacles to cure in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). After 
standard induction chemotherapy, patients are assigned to different
post-remission strategies on the basis of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities
that broadly define adverse, intermediate and favourable risk categories.
However, some patients do not respond to induction therapy and another subset
will eventually relapse despite the lack of adverse risk factors. There is an
urgent need for better biomarkers to identify these high-risk patients before
starting induction chemotherapy, to enable testing of alternative induction
strategies in clinical trials. The high rate of relapse in AML has been
attributed to the persistence of leukaemia stem cells (LSCs), which possess a
number of stem cell properties, including quiescence, that are linked to therapy 
resistance. Here, to develop predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers related to
stemness, we generated a list of genes that are differentially expressed between 
138 LSC+ and 89 LSC- cell fractions from 78 AML patients validated by
xenotransplantation. To extract the core transcriptional components of stemness
relevant to clinical outcomes, we performed sparse regression analysis of LSC
gene expression against survival in a large training cohort, generating a 17-gene
LSC score (LSC17). The LSC17 score was highly prognostic in five independent
cohorts comprising patients of diverse AML subtypes (n = 908) and contributed
greatly to accurate prediction of initial therapy resistance. Patients with high 
LSC17 scores had poor outcomes with current treatments including allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation. The LSC17 score provides clinicians with a rapid and
powerful tool to identify AML patients who do not benefit from standard therapy
and who should be enrolled in trials evaluating novel upfront or post-remission
strategies.

CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is one of 19 members of the chemokine receptor
subfamily of human class A G-protein-coupled receptors. CCR2 is expressed on
monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and T-cell subpopulations, and mediates
their migration towards endogenous CC chemokine ligands such as CCL2 (ref. 1).
CCR2 and its ligands are implicated in numerous inflammatory and
neurodegenerative diseases including atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, asthma,
neuropathic pain, and diabetic nephropathy, as well as cancer. These disease
associations have motivated numerous preclinical studies and clinical trials (see
http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) in search of therapies that target the
CCR2-chemokine axis. To aid drug discovery efforts, here we solve a structure of 
CCR2 in a ternary complex with an orthosteric (BMS-681 (ref. 6)) and allosteric
(CCR2-RA-[R]) antagonist. BMS-681 inhibits chemokine binding by occupying the
orthosteric pocket of the receptor in a previously unseen binding mode.
CCR2-RA-[R] binds in a novel, highly druggable pocket that is the most
intracellular allosteric site observed in class A G-protein-coupled receptors so 
far; this site spatially overlaps the G-protein-binding site in homologous
receptors. CCR2-RA-[R] inhibits CCR2 non-competitively by blocking
activation-associated conformational changes and formation of the
G-protein-binding interface. The conformational signature of the conserved
microswitch residues observed in double-antagonist-bound CCR2 resembles the most 
inactive G-protein-coupled receptor structures solved so far. Like other
protein-protein interactions, receptor-chemokine complexes are considered
challenging therapeutic targets for small molecules, and the present structure
suggests diverse pocket epitopes that can be exploited to overcome obstacles in
drug design.

The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both
affected by climate and human activity and affects climate, biological diversity 
and human wellbeing. Global data sets documenting surface water location and
seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions,
statistical extrapolation of regional data and satellite imagery, but measuring
long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three
million Landsat satellite images, we quantify changes in global surface water
over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years
when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in
terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface
water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly
equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water
covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions
show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional
(one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although
climate change is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than 
gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle 
East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river
diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal. Losses in Australia and the USA 
linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent,
validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations 
on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to 
show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this
freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide
evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between
biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.

The internal mechanics of proteins-the coordinated motions of amino acids and the
pattern of forces constraining these motions-connects protein structure to
function. Here we describe a new method combining the application of strong
electric field pulses to protein crystals with time-resolved X-ray
crystallography to observe conformational changes in spatial and temporal detail.
Using a human PDZ domain (LNX2PDZ2) as a model system, we show that protein
crystals tolerate electric field pulses strong enough to drive concerted motions 
on the sub-microsecond timescale. The induced motions are subtle, involve diverse
physical mechanisms, and occur throughout the protein structure. The global
pattern of electric-field-induced motions is consistent with both local and
allosteric conformational changes naturally induced by ligand binding, including 
at conserved functional sites in the PDZ domain family. This work lays the
foundation for comprehensive experimental study of the mechanical basis of
protein function.

Chemokines and their G-protein-coupled receptors play a diverse role in immune
defence by controlling the migration, activation and survival of immune cells.
They are also involved in viral entry, tumour growth and metastasis and hence are
important drug targets in a wide range of diseases. Despite very significant
efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to develop drugs, with over 50
small-molecule drugs directed at the family entering clinical development, only
two compounds have reached the market: maraviroc (CCR5) for HIV infection and
plerixafor (CXCR4) for stem-cell mobilization. The high failure rate may in part 
be due to limited understanding of the mechanism of action of chemokine
antagonists and an inability to optimize compounds in the absence of structural
information. CC chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) activation by CCL25 plays a key 
role in leukocyte recruitment to the gut and represents a therapeutic target in
inflammatory bowel disease. The selective CCR9 antagonist vercirnon progressed to
phase 3 clinical trials in Crohn's disease but efficacy was limited, with the
need for very high doses to block receptor activation. Here we report the crystal
structure of the CCR9 receptor in complex with vercirnon at 2.8 Å resolution.
Remarkably, vercirnon binds to the intracellular side of the receptor, exerting
allosteric antagonism and preventing G-protein coupling. This binding site
explains the need for relatively lipophilic ligands and describes another example
of an allosteric site on G-protein-coupled receptors that can be targeted for
drug design, not only at CCR9, but potentially extending to other chemokine
receptors.

The most prevalent route of HIV-1 infection is across mucosal tissues after
sexual contact. Langerhans cells (LCs) belong to the subset of dendritic cells
(DCs) that line the mucosal epithelia of vagina and foreskin and have the ability
to sense and induce immunity to invading pathogens. Anatomical and functional
characteristics make LCs one of the primary targets of HIV-1 infection. Notably, 
LCs form a protective barrier against HIV-1 infection and transmission. LCs
restrict HIV-1 infection through the capture of HIV-1 by the C-type lectin
receptor Langerin and subsequent internalization into Birbeck granules. However, 
the underlying molecular mechanism of HIV-1 restriction in LCs remains unknown.
Here we show that human E3-ubiquitin ligase tri-partite-containing motif 5α
(TRIM5α) potently restricts HIV-1 infection of LCs but not of subepithelial
DC-SIGN+ DCs. HIV-1 restriction by TRIM5α was thus far considered to be reserved 
to non-human primate TRIM5α orthologues, but our data strongly suggest that human
TRIM5α is a cell-specific restriction factor dependent on C-type lectin receptor 
function. Our findings highlight the importance of HIV-1 binding to Langerin for 
the routeing of HIV-1 into the human TRIM5α-mediated restriction pathway. TRIM5α 
mediates the assembly of an autophagy-activating scaffold to Langerin, which
targets HIV-1 for autophagic degradation and prevents infection of LCs. By
contrast, HIV-1 binding to DC-SIGN+ DCs leads to disassociation of TRIM5α from
DC-SIGN, which abrogates TRIM5α restriction. Thus, our data strongly suggest that
restriction by human TRIM5α is controlled by C-type-lectin-receptor-dependent
uptake of HIV-1, dictating protection or infection of human DC subsets.
Therapeutic interventions that incorporate C-type lectin receptors and
autophagy-targeting strategies could thus provide cell-mediated resistance to
HIV-1 in humans.

The functionality of stem cells declines during ageing, and this decline
contributes to ageing-associated impairments in tissue regeneration and function.
Alterations in developmental pathways have been associated with declines in
stem-cell function during ageing, but the nature of this process remains poorly
understood. Hox genes are key regulators of stem cells and tissue patterning
during embryogenesis with an unknown role in ageing. Here we show that the
epigenetic stress response in muscle stem cells (also known as satellite cells)
differs between aged and young mice. The alteration includes aberrant global and 
site-specific induction of active chromatin marks in activated satellite cells
from aged mice, resulting in the specific induction of Hoxa9 but not other Hox
genes. Hoxa9 in turn activates several developmental pathways and represents a
decisive factor that separates satellite cell gene expression in aged mice from
that in young mice. The activated pathways include most of the currently known
inhibitors of satellite cell function in ageing muscle, including Wnt, TGFβ,
JAK/STAT and senescence signalling. Inhibition of aberrant chromatin activation
or deletion of Hoxa9 improves satellite cell function and muscle regeneration in 
aged mice, whereas overexpression of Hoxa9 mimics ageing-associated defects in
satellite cells from young mice, which can be rescued by the inhibition of
Hoxa9-targeted developmental pathways. Together, these data delineate an altered 
epigenetic stress response in activated satellite cells from aged mice, which
limits satellite cell function and muscle regeneration by Hoxa9-dependent
activation of developmental pathways.

ISWI is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodellers, which also
includes Snf2, Chd1, and Ino80. ISWI is the catalytic subunit of several
chromatin remodelling complexes, which mobilize nucleosomes along genomic DNA,
promoting replication progression, transcription repression, heterochromatin
formation, and many other nuclear processes. The ATPase motor of ISWI is an
autonomous remodelling machine, whereas its carboxy (C)-terminal HAND-SAND-SLIDE 
(HSS) domain functions in binding extranucleosomal linker DNA. The activity of
the catalytic core of ISWI is inhibited by the regulatory AutoN and NegC domains,
which are in turn antagonized by the H4 tail and extranucleosomal DNA,
respectively, to ensure the appropriate chromatin landscape in cells. How AutoN
and NegC inhibit ISWI and regulate its nucleosome-centring activity remains
elusive. Here we report the crystal structures of ISWI from the thermophilic
yeast Myceliophthora thermophila and its complex with a histone H4 peptide. Our
data show the amino (N)-terminal AutoN domain contains two inhibitory elements,
which collectively bind the second RecA-like domain (core2), holding the enzyme
in an inactive conformation. The H4 peptide binds to the core2 domain coincident 
with one of the AutoN-binding sites, explaining the ISWI activation by H4. The
H4-binding surface is conserved in Snf2 and functions beyond AutoN regulation.
The C-terminal NegC domain is involved in binding to the core2 domain and
functions as an allosteric element for ISWI to respond to the extranucleosomal
DNA length.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves substantial genetic contributions. These 
contributions are profoundly heterogeneous but may converge on common pathways
that are not yet well understood. Here, through post-mortem genome-wide
transcriptome analysis of the largest cohort of samples analysed so far, to our
knowledge, we interrogate the noncoding transcriptome, alternative splicing, and 
upstream molecular regulators to broaden our understanding of molecular
convergence in ASD. Our analysis reveals ASD-associated dysregulation of
primate-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), downregulation of the alternative
splicing of activity-dependent neuron-specific exons, and attenuation of normal
differences in gene expression between the frontal and temporal lobes. Our data
suggest that SOX5, a transcription factor involved in neuron fate specification, 
contributes to this reduction in regional differences. We further demonstrate
that a genetically defined subtype of ASD, chromosome 15q11.2-13.1 duplication
syndrome (dup15q), shares the core transcriptomic signature observed in
idiopathic ASD. Co-expression network analysis reveals that individuals with ASD 
show age-related changes in the trajectory of microglial and synaptic function
over the first two decades, and suggests that genetic risk for ASD may influence 
changes in regional cortical gene expression. Our findings illustrate how diverse
genetic perturbations can lead to phenotypic convergence at multiple biological
levels in a complex neuropsychiatric disorder.

Artificial spin-ice systems are lithographically patterned arrangements of
interacting magnetic nanostructures that were introduced as way of investigating 
the effects of geometric frustration in a controlled manner. This approach has
enabled unconventional states of matter to be visualized directly in real space, 
and has triggered research at the frontier between nanomagnetism, statistical
thermodynamics and condensed matter physics. Despite efforts to create an
artificial realization of the square-ice model-a two-dimensional geometrically
frustrated spin-ice system defined on a square lattice-no simple geometry based
on arrays of nanomagnets has successfully captured the macroscopically degenerate
ground-state manifold of the model. Instead, square lattices of nanomagnets are
characterized by a magnetically ordered ground state that consists of local loop 
configurations with alternating chirality. Here we show that all of the
characteristics of the square-ice model are observed in an artificial square-ice 
system that consists of two sublattices of nanomagnets that are vertically
separated by a small distance. The spin configurations we image after
demagnetizing our arrays reveal unambiguous signatures of a Coulomb phase and
algebraic spin-spin correlations, which are characterized by the presence of
'pinch' points in the associated magnetic structure factor. Local excitations-the
classical analogues of magnetic monopoles-are free to evolve in an extensively
degenerate, divergence-free vacuum. We thus provide a protocol that could be used
to investigate collective magnetic phenomena, including Coulomb phases and the
physics of ice-like materials.

Light-induced oxidation of water by photosystem II (PS II) in plants, algae and
cyanobacteria has generated most of the dioxygen in the atmosphere. PS II, a
membrane-bound multi-subunit pigment protein complex, couples the one-electron
photochemistry at the reaction centre with the four-electron redox chemistry of
water oxidation at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC).
Under illumination, the OEC cycles through five intermediate S-states (S0 to S4),
in which S1 is the dark-stable state and S3 is the last semi-stable state before 
O-O bond formation and O2 evolution. A detailed understanding of the O-O bond
formation mechanism remains a challenge, and will require elucidation of both the
structures of the OEC in the different S-states and the binding of the two
substrate waters to the catalytic site. Here we report the use of femtosecond
pulses from an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to obtain damage-free, room
temperature structures of dark-adapted (S1), two-flash illuminated (2F;
S3-enriched), and ammonia-bound two-flash illuminated (2F-NH3; S3-enriched) PS
II. Although the recent 1.95 Å resolution structure of PS II at cryogenic
temperature using an XFEL provided a damage-free view of the S1 state,
measurements at room temperature are required to study the structural landscape
of proteins under functional conditions, and also for in situ advancement of the 
S-states. To investigate the water-binding site(s), ammonia, a water analogue,
has been used as a marker, as it binds to the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the S2 and S3
states. Since the ammonia-bound OEC is active, the ammonia-binding Mn site is not
a substrate water site. This approach, together with a comparison of the native
dark and 2F states, is used to discriminate between proposed O-O bond formation
mechanisms.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that can cause
severe disease, including congenital birth defects during pregnancy. To develop
candidate therapeutic agents against ZIKV, we isolated a panel of human
monoclonal antibodies from subjects that were previously infected with ZIKV. We
show that a subset of antibodies recognize diverse epitopes on the envelope (E)
protein and exhibit potent neutralizing activity. One of the most inhibitory
antibodies, ZIKV-117, broadly neutralized infection of ZIKV strains corresponding
to African and Asian-American lineages. Epitope mapping studies revealed that
ZIKV-117 recognized a unique quaternary epitope on the E protein dimer-dimer
interface. We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ZIKV-117 in pregnant and
non-pregnant mice. Monoclonal antibody treatment markedly reduced tissue
pathology, placental and fetal infection, and mortality in mice. Thus,
neutralizing human antibodies can protect against maternal-fetal transmission,
infection and disease, and reveal important determinants for structure-based
rational vaccine design efforts.

Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause congenital
malformations including microcephaly, which has focused global attention on this 
emerging pathogen. In addition to transmission by mosquitoes, ZIKV can be
detected in the seminal fluid of affected males for extended periods of time and 
transmitted sexually. Here, using a mouse-adapted African ZIKV strain (Dakar
41519), we evaluated the consequences of infection in the male reproductive tract
of mice. We observed persistence of ZIKV, but not the closely related dengue
virus (DENV), in the testis and epididymis of male mice, and this was associated 
with tissue injury that caused diminished testosterone and inhibin B levels and
oligospermia. ZIKV preferentially infected spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes
and Sertoli cells in the testis, resulting in cell death and destruction of the
seminiferous tubules. Less damage was caused by a contemporary Asian ZIKV strain 
(H/PF/2013), in part because this virus replicates less efficiently in mice. The 
extent to which these observations in mice translate to humans remains unclear,
but longitudinal studies of sperm function and viability in ZIKV-infected humans 
seem warranted.

The pressing global issue of food insecurity due to population growth,
diminishing land and variable climate can only be addressed in agriculture by
improving both maximum crop yield potential and resilience. Genetic modification 
is one potential solution, but has yet to achieve worldwide acceptance,
particularly for crops such as wheat. Trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), a central
sugar signal in plants, regulates sucrose use and allocation, underpinning crop
growth and development. Here we show that application of a chemical intervention 
strategy directly modulates T6P levels in planta. Plant-permeable analogues of
T6P were designed and constructed based on a 'signalling-precursor' concept for
permeability, ready uptake and sunlight-triggered release of T6P in planta. We
show that chemical intervention in a potent sugar signal increases grain yield,
whereas application to vegetative tissue improves recovery and resurrection from 
drought. This technology offers a means to combine increases in yield with crop
stress resilience. Given the generality of the T6P pathway in plants and other
small-molecule signals in biology, these studies suggest that suitable synthetic 
exogenous small-molecule signal precursors can be used to directly enhance plant 
performance and perhaps other organism function.

The type III secretion (T3S) injectisome is a specialized protein nanomachine
that is critical for the pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria, including 
purveyors of plague, typhoid fever, whooping cough, sexually transmitted
infections and major nosocomial infections. This syringe-shaped 3.5-MDa
macromolecular assembly spans both bacterial membranes and that of the infected
host cell. The internal channel formed by the injectisome allows for the direct
delivery of partially unfolded virulence effectors into the host cytoplasm. The
structural foundation of the injectisome is the basal body, a molecular lock-nut 
structure composed predominantly of three proteins that form highly oligomerized 
concentric rings spanning the inner and outer membranes. Here we present the
structure of the prototypical Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
pathogenicity island 1 basal body, determined using single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy, with the inner-membrane-ring and outer-membrane-ring oligomers
defined at 4.3 Å and 3.6 Å resolution, respectively. This work presents the
first, to our knowledge, high-resolution structural characterization of the major
components of the basal body in the assembled state, including that of the
widespread class of outer-membrane portals known as secretins.

Accumulating data suggest that metastatic dissemination often occurs early during
tumour formation, but the mechanisms of early metastatic spread have not yet been
addressed. Here, by studying metastasis in a HER2-driven mouse breast cancer
model, we show that progesterone-induced signalling triggers migration of cancer 
cells from early lesions shortly after HER2 activation, but promotes
proliferation in advanced primary tumour cells. The switch from migration to
proliferation was regulated by increased HER2 expression and tumour-cell density 
involving microRNA-mediated progesterone receptor downregulation, and was
reversible. Cells from early, low-density lesions displayed more stemness
features, migrated more and founded more metastases than cells from dense,
advanced tumours. Notably, we found that at least 80% of metastases were derived 
from early disseminated cancer cells. Karyotypic and phenotypic analysis of human
disseminated cancer cells and primary tumours corroborated the relevance of these
findings for human metastatic dissemination.

Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths; metastatic lesions
develop from disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that can remain dormant.
Metastasis-initiating cells are thought to originate from a subpopulation present
in progressed, invasive tumours. However, DCCs detected in patients before the
manifestation of breast-cancer metastasis contain fewer genetic abnormalities
than primary tumours or than DCCs from patients with metastases. These findings, 
and those in pancreatic cancer and melanoma models, indicate that dissemination
might occur during the early stages of tumour evolution. However, the mechanisms 
that might allow early disseminated cancer cells (eDCCs) to complete all steps of
metastasis are unknown. Here we show that, in early lesions in mice and before
any apparent primary tumour masses are detected, there is a sub-population of
Her2+p-p38lop-Atf2loTwist1hiE-cadlo early cancer cells that is invasive and can
spread to target organs. Intra-vital imaging and organoid studies of early
lesions showed that Her2+ eDCC precursors invaded locally, intravasated and
lodged in target organs. Her2+ eDCCs activated a Wnt-dependent
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like dissemination program but without
complete loss of the epithelial phenotype, which was reversed by Her2 or Wnt
inhibition. Notably, although the majority of eDCCs were Twist1hiE-cadlo and
dormant, they eventually initiated metastasis. Our work identifies a mechanism
for early dissemination in which Her2 aberrantly activates a program similar to
mammary ductal branching that generates eDCCs that are capable of forming
metastasis after a dormancy phase.

The lifetime of man-made materials is controlled largely by the wear and tear of 
everyday use, environmental stress and unexpected damage, which ultimately lead
to failure and disposal. Smart materials that mimic the ability of living systems
to autonomously protect, report, heal and even regenerate in response to damage
could increase the lifetime, safety and sustainability of many manufactured
items. There are several approaches to achieving these functions using
polymer-based materials, but making them work in highly variable, real-world
situations is proving challenging.

biological understanding and engineering capabilities develop, more sophisticated
biomedical materials can be synthesized that have multifaceted chemical,

Plastic bioelectronics is a research field that takes advantage of the inherent
properties of polymers and soft organic electronics for applications at the
interface of biology and electronics. The resulting electronic materials and
devices are soft, stretchable and mechanically conformable, which are important
qualities for interacting with biological systems in both wearable and
implantable devices. Work is currently aimed at improving these devices with a
view to making the electronic-biological interface as seamless as possible.

Enzymes are ideal for use in asymmetric catalysis by the chemical industry,
because their chemical compositions can be tailored to a specific substrate and
selectivity pattern while providing efficiencies and selectivities that surpass
those of classical synthetic methods. However, enzymes are limited to reactions
that are found in nature and, as such, facilitate fewer types of transformation
than do other forms of catalysis. Thus, a longstanding challenge in the field of 
biologically mediated catalysis has been to develop enzymes with new catalytic
functions. Here we describe a method for achieving catalytic promiscuity that
uses the photoexcited state of nicotinamide co-factors (molecules that assist
enzyme-mediated catalysis). Under irradiation with visible light, the
nicotinamide-dependent enzyme known as ketoreductase can be transformed from a
carbonyl reductase into an initiator of radical species and a chiral source of
hydrogen atoms. We demonstrate this new reactivity through a highly
enantioselective radical dehalogenation of lactones-a challenging transformation 
for small-molecule catalysts. Mechanistic experiments support the theory that a
radical species acts as an intermediate in this reaction, with NADH and NADPH
(the reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine nucleotide and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate, respectively) serving as both a photoreductant and the
source of hydrogen atoms. To our knowledge, this method represents the first
example of photo-induced enzyme promiscuity, and highlights the potential for
accessing new reactivity from existing enzymes simply by using the excited states
of common biological co-factors. This represents a departure from existing
light-driven biocatalytic techniques, which are typically explored in the context
of co-factor regeneration.

Renewable resources are used increasingly in the production of polymers. In
particular, monomers such as carbon dioxide, terpenes, vegetable oils and
carbohydrates can be used as feedstocks for the manufacture of a variety of
sustainable materials and products, including elastomers, plastics, hydrogels,
flexible electronics, resins, engineering polymers and composites. Efficient
catalysis is required to produce monomers, to facilitate selective
polymerizations and to enable recycling or upcycling of waste materials. There
are opportunities to use such sustainable polymers in both high-value areas and
in basic applications such as packaging. Life-cycle assessment can be used to
quantify the environmental benefits of sustainable polymers.

Young stars are associated with prominent outflows of molecular gas. The ejection
of gas is believed to remove angular momentum from the protostellar system,
permitting young stars to grow by the accretion of material from the protostellar
disk. The underlying mechanism for outflow ejection is not yet understood, but is
believed to be closely linked to the protostellar disk. Various models have been 
proposed to explain the outflows, differing mainly in the region where
acceleration of material takes place: close to the protostar itself ('X-wind', or
stellar wind), in a larger region throughout the protostellar disk (disk wind),
or at the interface between the two. Outflow launching regions have so far been
probed only by indirect extrapolation because of observational limits. Here we
report resolved images of carbon monoxide towards the outflow associated with the
TMC1A protostellar system. These data show that gas is ejected from a region
extending up to a radial distance of 25 astronomical units from the central
protostar, and that angular momentum is removed from an extended region of the
disk. This demonstrates that the outflowing gas is launched by an extended disk
wind from a Keplerian disk.

Seahorses have a specialized morphology that includes a toothless tubular mouth, 
a body covered with bony plates, a male brood pouch, and the absence of caudal
and pelvic fins. Here we report the sequencing and de novo assembly of the genome
of the tiger tail seahorse, Hippocampus comes. Comparative genomic analysis
identifies higher protein and nucleotide evolutionary rates in H. comes compared 
with other teleost fish genomes. We identified an astacin metalloprotease gene
family that has undergone expansion and is highly expressed in the male brood
pouch. We also find that the H. comes genome lacks enamel matrix protein-coding
proline/glutamine-rich secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein genes, which
might have led to the loss of mineralized teeth. tbx4, a regulator of hindlimb
development, is also not found in H. comes genome. Knockout of tbx4 in zebrafish 
showed a 'pelvic fin-loss' phenotype similar to that of seahorses.

Light- and ink-based three-dimensional (3D) printing methods allow the rapid
design and fabrication of materials without the need for expensive tooling, dies 
or lithographic masks. They have led to an era of manufacturing in which
computers can control the fabrication of soft matter that has tunable mechanical,
electrical and other functional properties. The expanding range of printable
materials, coupled with the ability to programmably control their composition and
architecture across various length scales, is driving innovation in myriad
applications. This is illustrated by examples of biologically inspired
composites, shape-morphing systems, soft sensors and robotics that only additive 
manufacturing can produce.

Cells grow well only in a narrow range of physiological conditions. Surviving
extreme conditions requires the instantaneous expression of chaperones that help 
to overcome stressful situations. To ensure the preferential synthesis of these
heat-shock proteins, cells inhibit transcription, pre-mRNA processing and nuclear
export of non-heat-shock transcripts, while stress-specific mRNAs are exclusively
exported and translated. How cells manage the selective retention of regular
transcripts and the simultaneous rapid export of heat-shock mRNAs is largely
unknown. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shuttling RNA adaptor proteins Npl3,
Gbp2, Hrb1 and Nab2 are loaded co-transcriptionally onto growing pre-mRNAs. For
nuclear export, they recruit the export-receptor heterodimer Mex67-Mtr2 (TAP-p15 
in humans). Here we show that cellular stress induces the dissociation of Mex67
and its adaptor proteins from regular mRNAs to prevent general mRNA export. At
the same time, heat-shock mRNAs are rapidly exported in association with Mex67,
without the need for adapters. The immediate co-transcriptional loading of Mex67 
onto heat-shock mRNAs involves Hsf1, a heat-shock transcription factor that binds
to heat-shock-promoter elements in stress-responsive genes. An important
difference between the export modes is that adaptor-protein-bound mRNAs undergo
quality control, whereas stress-specific transcripts do not. In fact, regular
mRNAs are converted into uncontrolled stress-responsive transcripts if expressed 
under the control of a heat-shock promoter, suggesting that whether an mRNA
undergoes quality control is encrypted therein. Under normal conditions, Mex67
adaptor proteins are recruited for RNA surveillance, with only quality-controlled
mRNAs allowed to associate with Mex67 and leave the nucleus. Thus, at the cost of
error-free mRNA formation, heat-shock mRNAs are exported and translated without
delay, allowing cells to survive extreme situations.

NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats) belong to a large
family of cytoplasmic sensors that regulate an extraordinarily diverse range of
biological functions. One of these functions is to contribute to immunity against
infectious diseases, but dysregulation of their functional activity leads to the 
development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Cytoplasmic innate immune
sensors, including NLRs, are central regulators of intestinal homeostasis. NLRC3 
(also known as CLR16.2 or NOD3) is a poorly characterized member of the NLR
family and was identified in a genomic screen for genes encoding proteins bearing
leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and nucleotide-binding domains. Expression of NLRC3
is drastically reduced in the tumour tissue of patients with colorectal cancer
compared to healthy tissues, highlighting an undefined potential function for
this sensor in the development of cancer. Here we show that mice lacking NLRC3
are hyper-susceptible to colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis. The effect of
NLRC3 is most dominant in enterocytes, in which it suppresses activation of the
mTOR signalling pathways and inhibits cellular proliferation and
stem-cell-derived organoid formation. NLRC3 associates with PI3Ks and blocks
activation of the PI3K-dependent kinase AKT following binding of growth factor
receptors or Toll-like receptor 4. These findings reveal a key role for NLRC3 as 
an inhibitor of the mTOR pathways, mediating protection against colorectal
cancer.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification of eukaryotic
messenger RNA (mRNA) and is decoded by YTH domain proteins. The mammalian mRNA
m6A methylosome is a complex of nuclear proteins that includes METTL3
(methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14, WTAP (Wilms tumour 1-associated protein) and
KIAA1429. Drosophila has corresponding homologues named Ime4 and KAR4 (Inducer of
meiosis 4 and Karyogamy protein 4), and Female-lethal (2)d (Fl(2)d) and Virilizer
(Vir). In Drosophila, fl(2)d and vir are required for sex-dependent regulation of
alternative splicing of the sex determination factor Sex lethal (Sxl). However,
the functions of m6A in introns in the regulation of alternative splicing remain 
uncertain. Here we show that m6A is absent in the mRNA of Drosophila lacking
Ime4. In contrast to mouse and plant knockout models, Drosophila Ime4-null
mutants remain viable, though flightless, and show a sex bias towards maleness.
This is because m6A is required for female-specific alternative splicing of Sxl, 
which determines female physiognomy, but also translationally represses
male-specific lethal 2 (msl-2) to prevent dosage compensation in females. We
further show that the m6A reader protein YT521-B decodes m6A in the
sex-specifically spliced intron of Sxl, as its absence phenocopies Ime4 mutants. 
Loss of m6A also affects alternative splicing of additional genes, predominantly 
in the 5' untranslated region, and has global effects on the expression of
metabolic genes. The requirement of m6A and its reader YT521-B for
female-specific Sxl alternative splicing reveals that this hitherto enigmatic
mRNA modification constitutes an ancient and specific mechanism to adjust levels 
of gene expression.

N6-methyladenosine RNA (m6A) is a prevalent messenger RNA modification in
vertebrates. Although its functions in the regulation of post-transcriptional
gene expression are beginning to be unveiled, the precise roles of m6A during
development of complex organisms remain unclear. Here we carry out a
comprehensive molecular and physiological characterization of the individual
components of the methyltransferase complex, as well as of the YTH
domain-containing nuclear reader protein in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify 
the member of the split ends protein family, Spenito, as a novel bona fide
subunit of the methyltransferase complex. We further demonstrate important roles 
of this complex in neuronal functions and sex determination, and implicate the
nuclear YT521-B protein as a main m6A effector in these processes. Altogether,
our work substantially extends our knowledge of m6A biology, demonstrating the
crucial functions of this modification in fundamental processes within the
context of the whole animal.

Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside
reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial
scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a
decrease in β-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most
studies have investigated losses in local (α)-diversity and neglected
biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing β-diversity have
focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus 
unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different
trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases
in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial,
plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely
independent of changes in α-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland
biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 
trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent
effects on β-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial,
fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear
and the strongest declines in β-diversity occurred in the transition from
extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce
local α-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the α-diversity increased in
belowground groups. Correlations between the β-diversity of different groups,
particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This 
suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic
homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale
biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for
conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed,
biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most
substantial consequence of land-use intensification.

Maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA mutations can cause fatal or severely 
debilitating syndromes in children, with disease severity dependent on the
specific gene mutation and the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy) 
in each cell and tissue. Pathogenic mtDNA mutations are relatively common, with
an estimated 778 affected children born each year in the United States.
Mitochondrial replacement therapies or techniques (MRT) circumventing
mother-to-child mtDNA disease transmission involve replacement of oocyte maternal
mtDNA. Here we report MRT outcomes in several families with common mtDNA
syndromes. The mother's oocytes were of normal quality and mutation levels
correlated with those in existing children. Efficient replacement of oocyte
mutant mtDNA was performed by spindle transfer, resulting in embryos containing
>99% donor mtDNA. Donor mtDNA was stably maintained in embryonic stem cells (ES
cells) derived from most embryos. However, some ES cell lines demonstrated
gradual loss of donor mtDNA and reversal to the maternal haplotype. In evaluating
donor-to-maternal mtDNA interactions, it seems that compatibility relates to
mtDNA replication efficiency rather than to mismatch or oxidative phosphorylation
dysfunction. We identify a polymorphism within the conserved sequence box II
region of the D-loop as a plausible cause of preferential replication of specific
mtDNA haplotypes. In addition, some haplotypes confer proliferative and growth
advantages to cells. Hence, we propose a matching paradigm for selecting
compatible donor mtDNA for MRT.

Chromosomes are folded into highly compacted structures to accommodate physical
constraints within nuclei and to regulate access to genomic information.
Recently, global mapping of pairwise contacts showed that loops anchoring
topological domains (TADs) are highly conserved between cell types and species.
Whether pairwise loops synergize to form higher-order structures is still
unclear. Here we develop a conformation capture assay to study higher-order
organization using chromosomal walks (C-walks) that link multiple genomic loci
together into proximity chains in human and mouse cells. This approach captures
chromosomal structure at varying scales. Inter-chromosomal contacts constitute
only 7-10% of the pairs and are restricted by interfacing TADs. About half of the
C-walks stay within one chromosome, and almost half of those are restricted to
intra-TAD spaces. C-walks that couple 2-4 TADs indicate stochastic associations
between transcriptionally active, early replicating loci. Targeted analysis of
thousands of 3-walks anchored at highly expressed genes support pairwise, rather 
than hub-like, chromosomal topology at active loci. Polycomb-repressed Hox
domains are shown by the same approach to enrich for synergistic hubs. Together, 
the data indicate that chromosomal territories, TADs, and intra-TAD loops are
primarily driven by nested, possibly dynamic, pairwise contacts.

Complex biological processes are often performed by self-organizing
nanostructures comprising multiple classes of macromolecules, such as ribosomes
(proteins and RNA) or enveloped viruses (proteins, nucleic acids and lipids).
Approaches have been developed for designing self-assembling structures
consisting of either nucleic acids or proteins, but strategies for engineering
hybrid biological materials are only beginning to emerge. Here we describe the
design of self-assembling protein nanocages that direct their own release from
human cells inside small vesicles in a manner that resembles some viruses. We
refer to these hybrid biomaterials as 'enveloped protein nanocages' (EPNs).
Robust EPN biogenesis requires protein sequence elements that encode three
distinct functions: membrane binding, self-assembly, and recruitment of the
endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. A variety
of synthetic proteins with these functional elements induce EPN biogenesis,
highlighting the modularity and generality of the design strategy. Biochemical
analyses and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that one design, EPN-01, comprises
small (~100 nm) vesicles containing multiple protein nanocages that closely match
the structure of the designed 60-subunit self-assembling scaffold. EPNs that
incorporate the vesicular stomatitis viral glycoprotein can fuse with target
cells and deliver their contents, thereby transferring cargoes from one cell to
another. These results show how proteins can be programmed to direct the
formation of hybrid biological materials that perform complex tasks, and
establish EPNs as a class of designed, modular, genetically-encoded nanomaterials
that can transfer molecules between cells.

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) exhibits divergent effects in 
skeletal muscle. At physiological levels, signalling through this receptor
promotes muscle development in growing embryos and angiogenesis in regenerating
adult muscle. However, both increased PDGF ligand abundance and enhanced PDGFRα
pathway activity cause pathological fibrosis. This excessive collagen deposition,
which is seen in aged and diseased muscle, interferes with muscle function and
limits the effectiveness of gene- and cell-based therapies for muscle disorders. 
Although compelling evidence exists for the role of PDGFRα in fibrosis, little is
known about the cells through which this pathway acts. Here we show in mice that 
PDGFRα signalling regulates a population of muscle-resident fibro/adipogenic
progenitors (FAPs) that play a supportive role in muscle regeneration but may
also cause fibrosis when aberrantly regulated. We found that FAPs produce
multiple transcriptional variants of Pdgfra with different polyadenylation sites,
including an intronic variant that codes for a protein isoform containing a
truncated kinase domain. This variant, upregulated during regeneration, acts as a
decoy to inhibit PDGF signalling and to prevent FAP over-activation. Moreover,
increasing the expression of this isoform limits fibrosis in vivo in mice,
suggesting both biological relevance and therapeutic potential of modulating
polyadenylation patterns in stem-cell populations.

Wild and managed pollinators provide a wide range of benefits to society in terms
of contributions to food security, farmer and beekeeper livelihoods, social and
cultural values, as well as the maintenance of wider biodiversity and ecosystem
stability. Pollinators face numerous threats, including changes in land-use and
management intensity, climate change, pesticides and genetically modified crops, 
pollinator management and pathogens, and invasive alien species. There are
well-documented declines in some wild and managed pollinators in several regions 
of the world. However, many effective policy and management responses can be
implemented to safeguard pollinators and sustain pollination services.

Dynamics of a seafloor-spreading episode at the East Pacific Rise.

Seafloor spreading is largely unobserved because 98 per cent of the global
mid-ocean-ridge system is below the ocean surface. Our understanding of the
dynamic processes that control seafloor spreading is thus inferred largely from
geophysical observations of spreading events on land at Afar in East Africa and
Iceland. However, these are slow-spreading centres influenced by mantle plumes.
The roles of magma pressure and tectonic stress in the development of seafloor
spreading are still unclear. Here we use seismic observations to show that the
most recent eruption at the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise just North of the
Equator initiated at a melt-rich segment about 5 kilometres long. The change in
static stress then promoted almost-concurrent rupturing along at least 35
kilometres of the ridge axis, where tectonic stress had built up to a critical
level, triggering magma movement. The location of impulsive seismic events
indicative of lava reaching the seafloor suggests that lava subsequently erupted 
from multiple isolated magma lenses (reservoir chambers) with variable magma
ascent rates, mostly within 48 hours. Therefore, even at magmatically robust
fast-spreading ridges, a substantial portion of the spreading may be due to
tectonic stress building up to a critical level rather than magma overpressure in
the underlying magma lenses.

The development of immunologic interventions that can target the viral reservoir 
in HIV-1-infected individuals is a major goal of HIV-1 research. However, little 
evidence exists that the viral reservoir can be sufficiently targeted to improve 
virologic control following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. Here we
show that therapeutic vaccination with Ad26/MVA (recombinant adenovirus serotype 
26 (Ad26) prime, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost) and stimulation of TLR7
(Toll-like receptor 7) improves virologic control and delays viral rebound
following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy in SIV-infected rhesus
monkeys that began antiretroviral therapy during acute infection. Therapeutic
vaccination with Ad26/MVA resulted in a marked increase in the magnitude and
breadth of SIV-specific cellular immune responses in virologically suppressed,
SIV-infected monkeys. TLR7 agonist administration led to innate immune
stimulation and cellular immune activation. The combination of Ad26/MVA
vaccination and TLR7 stimulation resulted in decreased levels of viral DNA in
lymph nodes and peripheral blood, and improved virologic control and delayed
viral rebound following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. The breadth of
cellular immune responses correlated inversely with set point viral loads and
correlated directly with time to viral rebound. These data demonstrate the
potential of therapeutic vaccination combined with innate immune stimulation as a
strategy aimed at a functional cure for HIV-1 infection.

R-2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates to millimolar levels in cancer cells with
gain-of-function isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations. These levels of
R-2-hydroxyglutarate affect 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Both
metabolite enantiomers, R- and S-2-hydroxyglutarate, are detectible in healthy
individuals, yet their physiological function remains elusive. Here we show that 
2-hydroxyglutarate accumulates in mouse CD8+ T cells in response to T-cell
receptor triggering, and accumulates to millimolar levels in physiological oxygen
conditions through a hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α)-dependent
mechanism. S-2-hydroxyglutarate predominates over R-2-hydroxyglutarate in
activated T cells, and we demonstrate alterations in markers of CD8+ T-cell
differentiation in response to this metabolite. Modulation of histone and DNA
demethylation, as well as HIF-1α stability, mediate these effects.
S-2-hydroxyglutarate treatment greatly enhances the in vivo proliferation,
persistence and anti-tumour capacity of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells.
Thus, S-2-hydroxyglutarate acts as an immunometabolite that links environmental
context, through a metabolic-epigenetic axis, to immune fate and function.

The Enterobacteriaceae are a family of Gram-negative bacteria that include
commensal organisms as well as primary and opportunistic pathogens that are among
the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although
Enterobacteriaceae often comprise less than 1% of a healthy intestine's
microbiota, some of these organisms can bloom in the inflamed gut; expansion of
enterobacteria is a hallmark of microbial imbalance known as dysbiosis. Microcins
are small secreted proteins that possess antimicrobial activity in vitro, but
whose role in vivo has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that microcins enable
the probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to limit the expansion
of competing Enterobacteriaceae (including pathogens and pathobionts) during
intestinal inflammation. Microcin-producing EcN limits the growth of competitors 
in the inflamed intestine, including commensal E. coli, adherent-invasive E. coli
and the related pathogen Salmonella enterica. Moreover, only therapeutic
administration of the wild-type, microcin-producing EcN to mice previously
infected with S. enterica substantially reduced intestinal colonization by the
pathogen. Our work provides the first evidence that microcins mediate inter- and 
intraspecies competition among the Enterobacteriaceae in the inflamed gut.
Moreover, we show that microcins can act as narrow-spectrum therapeutics to
inhibit enteric pathogens and reduce enterobacterial blooms.

Endogenous viral elements are increasingly found in eukaryotic genomes, yet
little is known about their origins, dynamics, or function. Here we provide a
compelling example of a DNA virus that readily integrates into a eukaryotic
genome where it acts as an inducible antiviral defence system. We found that the 
virophage mavirus, a parasite of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV), 
integrates at multiple sites within the nuclear genome of the marine protozoan
Cafeteria roenbergensis. The endogenous mavirus is structurally and genetically
similar to eukaryotic DNA transposons and endogenous viruses of the
Maverick/Polinton family. Provirophage genes are not constitutively expressed,
but are specifically activated by superinfection with CroV, which induces the
production of infectious mavirus particles. Virophages can inhibit the
replication of mimivirus-like giant viruses and an anti-viral protective effect
of provirophages on their hosts has been hypothesized. We find that
provirophage-carrying cells are not directly protected from CroV; however, lysis 
of these cells releases infectious mavirus particles that are then able to
suppress CroV replication and enhance host survival during subsequent rounds of
infection. The microbial host-parasite interaction described here involves an
altruistic aspect and suggests that giant-virus-induced activation of
provirophages might be ecologically relevant in natural protist populations.

The Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contains the equivalent of 7.4 metres of global
sea-level rise. Its stability in our warming climate is therefore a pressing
concern. However, the sparse proxy evidence of the palaeo-stability of the GIS
means that its history is controversial (compare refs 2 and 3 to ref. 4). Here we
show that Greenland was deglaciated for extended periods during the Pleistocene
epoch (from 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago), based on new measurements
of cosmic-ray-produced beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in a
bedrock core from beneath an ice core near the GIS summit. Models indicate that
when this bedrock site is ice-free, any remaining ice is concentrated in the
eastern Greenland highlands and the GIS is reduced to less than ten per cent of
its current volume. Our results narrow the spectrum of possible GIS histories:
the longest period of stability of the present ice sheet that is consistent with 
the measurements is 1.1 million years, assuming that this was preceded by more
than 280,000 years of ice-free conditions. Other scenarios, in which Greenland
was ice-free during any or all Pleistocene interglacials, may be more realistic. 
Our observations are incompatible with most existing model simulations that
present a continuously existing Pleistocene GIS. Future simulations of the GIS
should take into account that Greenland was nearly ice-free for extended periods 
under Pleistocene climate forcing.

Unlike spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, the majority of the stars in
massive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history of
the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using the
ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]) in spectra, which reflects the
relative enrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, 
[Mg/Fe] probes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the
galaxy, including younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time
mergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we
must study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which [Mg/Fe] 
had previously been measured is at a redshift of z ≈ 1.4, with [Mg/Fe] = . A
slightly earlier epoch (z ≈ 1.6) was probed by combining the spectra of 24
massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average [Mg/Fe] = 0.31 ± 0.12 (ref. 7).
However, the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the use of
index analysis techniques for both of these studies resulted in measurement
errors that are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra 
at even earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full
spectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern shortly 
after the major star-forming phase (z > 2). Here we report a measurement of
[Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at a redshift of z = 2.1, when the
Universe was three billion years old. With [Mg/Fe] = 0.59 ± 0.11, this galaxy is 
the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice the Mg enhancement
of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the galaxy is consistent
with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae and with a star-formation
timescale of 0.1 to 0.5 billion years-characteristics that are similar to
population II stars in the Milky Way. With an average past star-formation rate of
600 to 3,000 solar masses per year, this galaxy was among the most vigorous
star-forming galaxies in the Universe.

Climate models show that ice-sheet melt will dominate sea-level rise over the
coming centuries, but our understanding of ice-sheet variations before the last
interglacial 125,000 years ago remains fragmentary. This is because terrestrial
deposits of ancient glacial and interglacial periods are overrun and eroded by
more recent glacial advances, and are therefore usually rare, isolated and poorly
dated. In contrast, material shed almost continuously from continents is
preserved as marine sediment that can be analysed to infer the time-varying state
of major ice sheets. Here we show that the East Greenland Ice Sheet existed over 
the past 7.5 million years, as indicated by beryllium and aluminium isotopes
(10Be and 26Al) in quartz sand removed by deep, ongoing glacial erosion on land
and deposited offshore in the marine sedimentary record. During the early
Pleistocene epoch, ice cover in East Greenland was dynamic; in contrast, East
Greenland was mostly ice-covered during the mid-to-late Pleistocene. The isotope 
record we present is consistent with distinct signatures of changes in ice sheet 
behaviour coincident with major climate transitions. Although our data are
continuous, they are from low-deposition-rate sites and sourced only from East
Greenland. Consequently, the signal of extensive deglaciation during short,
intense interglacials could be missed or blurred, and we cannot distinguish
between a remnant ice sheet in the East Greenland highlands and a diminished
continent-wide ice sheet. A clearer constraint on the behaviour of the ice sheet 
during past and, ultimately, future interglacial warmth could be produced by 10Be
and 26Al records from a coring site with a higher deposition rate. Nonetheless,
our analysis challenges the possibility of complete and extended deglaciation
over the past several million years.

Changes in gamma oscillations (20-50 Hz) have been observed in several
neurological disorders. However, the relationship between gamma oscillations and 
cellular pathologies is unclear. Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma
oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse
model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking
parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other
frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-β (Aβ)1-40 and Aβ 1-42 isoforms. Gene
expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological
transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased
microglia co-localization with Aβ. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz
light-flickering regime that reduced Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in the visual
cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice.
Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in
recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate
Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.

The concept of randomness plays an important part in many disciplines. On the one
hand, the question of whether random processes exist is fundamental for our
understanding of nature. On the other, randomness is a resource for cryptography,
algorithms and simulations. Standard methods for generating randomness rely on
assumptions about the devices that are often not valid in practice. However,
quantum technologies enable new methods for generating certified randomness,
based on the violation of Bell inequalities. These methods are referred to as
device-independent because they do not rely on any modelling of the devices. Here
we review efforts to design device-independent randomness generators and the
associated challenges.

The Yorkie homologues YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional
coactivator with PDZ-binding motif, also known as WWTR1), effectors of the Hippo 
pathway, have been identified as mediators for mechanical stimuli. However, the
role of YAP/TAZ in haemodynamics-induced mechanotransduction and pathogenesis of 
atherosclerosis remains unclear. Here we show that endothelial YAP/TAZ activity
is regulated by different patterns of blood flow, and YAP/TAZ inhibition
suppresses inflammation and retards atherogenesis. Atheroprone-disturbed flow
increases whereas atheroprotective unidirectional shear stress inhibits YAP/TAZ
activity. Unidirectional shear stress activates integrin and promotes
integrin-Gα13 interaction, leading to RhoA inhibition and YAP phosphorylation and
suppression. YAP/TAZ inhibition suppresses JNK signalling and downregulates
pro-inflammatory genes expression, thereby reducing monocyte attachment and
infiltration. In vivo endothelial-specific YAP overexpression exacerbates, while 
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Yap knockdown in endothelium retards, plaque formation in
ApoE-/- mice. We also show several existing anti-atherosclerotic agents such as
statins inhibit YAP/TAZ transactivation. On the other hand, simvastatin fails to 
suppress constitutively active YAP/TAZ-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression
in endothelial cells, indicating that YAP/TAZ inhibition could contribute to the 
anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin. Furthermore, activation of integrin by
oral administration of MnCl2 reduces plaque formation. Taken together, our
results indicate that integrin-Gα13-RhoA-YAP pathway holds promise as a novel
drug target against atherosclerosis.

A quantum spin liquid is an exotic quantum state of matter in which spins are
highly entangled and remain disordered down to zero temperature. Such a state of 
matter is potentially relevant to high-temperature superconductivity and
quantum-information applications, and experimental identification of a quantum
spin liquid state is of fundamental importance for our understanding of quantum
matter. Theoretical studies have proposed various quantum-spin-liquid ground
states, most of which are characterized by exotic spin excitations with
fractional quantum numbers (termed 'spinons'). Here we report neutron scattering 
measurements of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet YbMgGaO4 that reveal broad
spin excitations covering a wide region of the Brillouin zone. The observed
diffusive spin excitation persists at the lowest measured energy and shows a
clear upper excitation edge, consistent with the particle-hole excitation of a
spinon Fermi surface. Our results therefore point to the existence of a quantum
spin liquid state with a spinon Fermi surface in YbMgGaO4, which has a perfect
spin-1/2 triangular lattice as in the original proposal of quantum spin liquids.

The neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmit synaptic 
signals by activating fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels and more slowly
acting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The GPCRs for these
neurotransmitters, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) and GABAB receptors, are
atypical GPCRs with a large extracellular domain and a mandatory dimeric
structure. Recent studies have revealed how these receptors are activated through
multiple allosteric interactions between subunit domains. It emerges that the
molecular complexity of these receptors is further increased through association 
with trafficking, effector and regulatory proteins. The structure and composition
of these receptors present opportunities for therapeutic intervention in mental
health and neurological disorders.

Chimaeras are both monsters of the ancient imagination and a long-established
research tool. Recent advances, particularly those dealing with the
identification and generation of various kinds of stem cells, have broadened the 
repertoire and utility of mammalian interspecies chimaeras and carved out new
paths towards understanding fundamental biology as well as potential clinical

Cultured pluripotent stem cells are a cornerstone of regenerative medicine owing 
to their ability to give rise to all cell types of the body. Although pluripotent
stem cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, pluripotency is paradoxically
a transient state in vivo, lasting 2-3 days around the time of blastocyst
implantation. The exception to this rule is embryonic diapause, a reversible
state of suspended development triggered by unfavourable conditions. Diapause is 
a physiological reproductive strategy widely employed across the animal kingdom, 
including in mammals, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we
report that the partial inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a
major nutrient sensor and promoter of growth, induces reversible pausing of mouse
blastocyst development and allows their prolonged culture ex vivo. Paused
blastocysts remain pluripotent and competent-able to give rise to embryonic stem 
(ES) cells and live, fertile mice. We show that both naturally diapaused
blastocysts in vivo and paused blastocysts ex vivo display pronounced reductions 
in mTOR activity, translation, histone modifications associated with gene
activity and transcription. Pausing can be induced directly in cultured ES cells 
and sustained for weeks without appreciable cell death or deviations from cell
cycle distributions. We show that paused ES cells display a remarkable global
suppression of transcription, maintain a gene expression signature of diapaused
blastocysts and remain pluripotent. These results uncover a new pluripotent stem 
cell state corresponding to the epiblast of the diapaused blastocyst and indicate
that mTOR regulates developmental timing at the peri-implantation stage. Our
findings have implications in the fields of assisted reproduction, regenerative
medicine, cancer, metabolic disorders and ageing.

The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection,
influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment. Such behavioural rhythms are
well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions, but free-living
individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others,
including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators. Individuals can
temporally segregate their daily activities (for example, prey avoiding
predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (for 
example, group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for
offspring). The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization 
and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain
poorly understood. Here we investigate these rhythms in the context of biparental
care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization where pair members
potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 
populations of 32 biparentally incubating shorebird species, where parents
synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report
remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between
species, the median length of one parent's incubation bout varied from 1-19 h,
whereas period length-the time in which a parent's probability to incubate cycles
once between its highest and lowest value-varied from 6-43 h. The length of
incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but
species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had 
longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or who actively
protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light-dark 
cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results
indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h
environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse
behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity. The
risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the
diversity in these rhythms.

Organisms use endogenous clocks to anticipate regular environmental cycles, such 
as days and tides. Natural variants resulting in differently timed behaviour or
physiology, known as chronotypes in humans, have not been well characterized at
the molecular level. We sequenced the genome of Clunio marinus, a marine midge
whose reproduction is timed by circadian and circalunar clocks. Midges from
different locations show strain-specific genetic timing adaptations. We examined 
genetic variation in five C. marinus strains from different locations and mapped 
quantitative trait loci for circalunar and circadian chronotypes. The region most
strongly associated with circadian chronotypes generates strain-specific
differences in the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1
(CaMKII.1) splice variants. As equivalent variants were shown to alter CaMKII
activity in Drosophila melanogaster, and C. marinus (Cma)-CaMKII.1 increases the 
transcriptional activity of the dimer of the circadian proteins Cma-CLOCK and
Cma-CYCLE, we suggest that modulation of alternative splicing is a mechanism for 
natural adaptation in circadian timing.

The deep nitrogen-covered basin on Pluto, informally named Sputnik Planitia, is
located very close to the longitude of Pluto's tidal axis and may be an impact
feature, by analogy with other large basins in the Solar System. Reorientation of
Sputnik Planitia arising from tidal and rotational torques can explain the
basin's present-day location, but requires the feature to be a positive gravity
anomaly, despite its negative topography. Here we argue that if Sputnik Planitia 
did indeed form as a result of an impact and if Pluto possesses a subsurface
ocean, the required positive gravity anomaly would naturally result because of
shell thinning and ocean uplift, followed by later modest nitrogen deposition.
Without a subsurface ocean, a positive gravity anomaly requires an implausibly
thick nitrogen layer (exceeding 40 kilometres). To prolong the lifetime of such a
subsurface ocean to the present day and to maintain ocean uplift, a rigid,
conductive water-ice shell is required. Because nitrogen deposition is
latitude-dependent, nitrogen loading and reorientation may have exhibited complex
feedbacks.

Pluto is an astoundingly diverse, geologically dynamic world. The dominant
feature is Sputnik Planitia-a tear-drop-shaped topographic depression
approximately 1,000 kilometres in diameter possibly representing an ancient
impact basin. The interior of Sputnik Planitia is characterized by a smooth,
craterless plain three to four kilometres beneath the surrounding rugged uplands,
and represents the surface of a massive unit of actively convecting volatile ices
(N2, CH4 and CO) several kilometres thick. This large feature is very near the
Pluto-Charon tidal axis. Here we report that the location of Sputnik Planitia is 
the natural consequence of the sequestration of volatile ices within the basin
and the resulting reorientation (true polar wander) of Pluto. Loading of volatile
ices within a basin the size of Sputnik Planitia can substantially alter Pluto's 
inertia tensor, resulting in a reorientation of the dwarf planet of around 60
degrees with respect to the rotational and tidal axes. The combination of this
reorientation, loading and global expansion due to the freezing of a possible
subsurface ocean generates stresses within the planet's lithosphere, resulting in
a global network of extensional faults that closely replicate the observed fault 
networks on Pluto. Sputnik Planitia probably formed northwest of its present
location, and was loaded with volatiles over million-year timescales as a result 
of volatile transport cycles on Pluto. Pluto's past, present and future
orientation is controlled by feedbacks between volatile sublimation and
condensation, changing insolation conditions and Pluto's interior structure.

Targeted genome editing via engineered nucleases is an exciting area of
biomedical research and holds potential for clinical applications. Despite rapid 
advances in the field, in vivo targeted transgene integration is still infeasible
because current tools are inefficient, especially for non-dividing cells, which
compose most adult tissues. This poses a barrier for uncovering fundamental
biological principles and developing treatments for a broad range of genetic
disorders. Based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9
(CRISPR/Cas9) technology, here we devise a homology-independent targeted
integration (HITI) strategy, which allows for robust DNA knock-in in both
dividing and non-dividing cells in vitro and, more importantly, in vivo (for
example, in neurons of postnatal mammals). As a proof of concept of its
therapeutic potential, we demonstrate the efficacy of HITI in improving visual
function using a rat model of the retinal degeneration condition retinitis
pigmentosa. The HITI method presented here establishes new avenues for basic
research and targeted gene therapies.

In all domains of life, selenocysteine (Sec) is delivered to the ribosome by
selenocysteine-specific tRNA (tRNASec) with the help of a specialized translation
factor, SelB in bacteria. Sec-tRNASec recodes a UGA stop codon next to a
downstream mRNA stem-loop. Here we present the structures of six intermediates on
the pathway of UGA recoding in Escherichia coli by single-particle cryo-electron 
microscopy. The structures explain the specificity of Sec-tRNASec binding by SelB
and show large-scale rearrangements of Sec-tRNASec. Upon initial binding of
SelB-Sec-tRNASec to the ribosome and codon reading, the 30S subunit adopts an
open conformation with Sec-tRNASec covering the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) on the
50S subunit. Subsequent codon recognition results in a local closure of the
decoding site, which moves Sec-tRNASec away from the SRL and triggers a global
closure of the 30S subunit shoulder domain. As a consequence, SelB docks on the
SRL, activating the GTPase of SelB. These results reveal how codon recognition
triggers GTPase activation in translational GTPases.

mixed lineage kinase-like (MLKL)-dependent necroptosis. However, mice expressing 
catalytically inactive RIPK1 are viable, and an ill-defined pro-survival function
for the RIPK1 scaffold has therefore been proposed. Here we show that the RIP
homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) in RIPK1 prevents the RHIM-containing adaptor 
protein ZBP1 (Z-DNA binding protein 1; also known as DAI or DLM1) from activating
RIPK3 upstream of MLKL. Ripk1RHIM/RHIM mice that expressed mutant RIPK1 with
critical RHIM residues IQIG mutated to AAAA died around birth and exhibited RIPK3
autophosphorylation on Thr231 and Ser232, which is a hallmark of necroptosis, in 
the skin and thymus. Blocking necroptosis with catalytically inactive
RIPK3(D161N), RHIM mutant RIPK3, RIPK3 deficiency, or MLKL deficiency prevented
lethality in Ripk1RHIM/RHIM mice. Loss of ZBP1, which engages RIPK3 in response
to certain viruses but previously had no defined role in development, also
prevented perinatal lethality in Ripk1RHIM/RHIM mice. Consistent with the RHIM of
RIPK1 functioning as a brake that prevents ZBP1 from engaging the RIPK3 RHIM,
ZBP1 interacted with RIPK3 in Ripk1RHIM/RHIMMlkl-/- macrophages, but not in
wild-type, Mlkl-/- or Ripk1RHIM/RHIMRipk3RHIM/RHIM macrophages. Collectively,
these findings indicate that the RHIM of RIPK1 is critical for preventing
ZBP1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis during development.

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates cell death and
inflammation through kinase-dependent and -independent functions. RIPK1 kinase
activity induces caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and RIPK3 and mixed lineage kinase
like (MLKL)-dependent necroptosis. In addition, RIPK1 inhibits apoptosis and
necroptosis through kinase-independent functions, which are important for late
embryonic development and the prevention of inflammation in epithelial barriers. 
The mechanism by which RIPK1 counteracts RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis has
remained unknown. Here we show that RIPK1 prevents skin inflammation by
inhibiting activation of RIPK3-MLKL-dependent necroptosis mediated by Z-DNA
binding protein 1 (ZBP1, also known as DAI or DLM1). ZBP1 deficiency inhibited
keratinocyte necroptosis and skin inflammation in mice with epidermis-specific
RIPK1 knockout. Moreover, mutation of the conserved RIP homotypic interaction
motif (RHIM) of endogenous mouse RIPK1 (RIPK1mRHIM) caused perinatal lethality
that was prevented by RIPK3, MLKL or ZBP1 deficiency. Furthermore, mice
expressing only RIPK1mRHIM in keratinocytes developed skin inflammation that was 
abrogated by MLKL or ZBP1 deficiency. Mechanistically, ZBP1 interacted strongly
with phosphorylated RIPK3 in cells expressing RIPK1mRHIM, suggesting that the
RIPK1 RHIM prevents ZBP1 from binding and activating RIPK3. Collectively, these
results show that RIPK1 prevents perinatal death as well as skin inflammation in 
adult mice by inhibiting ZBP1-induced necroptosis. Furthermore, these findings
identify ZBP1 as a critical mediator of inflammation beyond its previously known 
role in antiviral defence and suggest that ZBP1 might be implicated in the
pathogenesis of necroptosis-associated inflammatory diseases.

Pluto has a variety of surface frosts and landforms as well as a complex
atmosphere. There is ongoing geological activity related to the massive Sputnik
Planitia glacier, mostly made of nitrogen (N2) ice mixed with solid carbon
monoxide and methane, covering the 4-kilometre-deep, 1,000-kilometre-wide basin
of Sputnik Planitia near the anti-Charon point. The glacier has been suggested to
arise from a source region connected to the deep interior, or from a sink
collecting the volatiles released planetwide. Thin deposits of N2 frost, however,
were also detected at mid-northern latitudes and methane ice was observed to
cover most of Pluto except for the darker, frost-free equatorial regions. Here we
report numerical simulations of the evolution of N2, methane and carbon monoxide 
on Pluto over thousands of years. The model predicts N2 ice accumulation in the
deepest low-latitude basin and the threefold increase in atmospheric pressure
that has been observed to occur since 1988. This points to
atmospheric-topographic processes as the origin of Sputnik Planitia's N2 glacier.
The same simulations also reproduce the observed quantities of volatiles in the
atmosphere and show frosts of methane, and sometimes N2, that seasonally cover
the mid- and high latitudes, explaining the bright northern polar cap reported in
the 1990s and the observed ice distribution in 2015. The model also predicts that
most of these seasonal frosts should disappear in the next decade.

Mitochondria cannot be generated de novo; they must grow, replicate their genome,
and divide in order to be inherited by each daughter cell during mitosis.
Mitochondrial division is a structural challenge that requires the substantial
remodelling of membrane morphology. Although division factors differ across
organisms, the need for multiple constriction steps and a dynamin-related protein
(Drp1, Dnm1 in yeast) has been conserved. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial
division has been shown to proceed with at least two sequential constriction
steps: the endoplasmic reticulum and actin must first collaborate to generate
constrictions suitable for Drp1 assembly on the mitochondrial outer membrane;
Drp1 then further constricts membranes until mitochondrial fission occurs. In
vitro experiments, however, indicate that Drp1 does not have the dynamic range to
complete membrane fission. In contrast to Drp1, the neuron-specific classical
dynamin dynamin-1 (Dyn1) has been shown to assemble on narrower lipid profiles
and facilitate spontaneous membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. Here we report
that the ubiquitously expressed classical dynamin-2 (Dyn2) is a fundamental
component of the mitochondrial division machinery. A combination of live-cell and
electron microscopy in three different mammalian cell lines reveals that Dyn2
works in concert with Drp1 to orchestrate sequential constriction events that
build up to division. Our work underscores the biophysical limitations of Drp1
and positions Dyn2, which has intrinsic membrane fission properties, at the final
step of mitochondrial division.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that exchange contents and undergo
remodelling during cyclic fusion and fission. Genetic mutations in MFN2 (the gene
encoding mitofusin 2) interrupt mitochondrial fusion and cause the untreatable
neurodegenerative condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). It has
not yet been possible to directly modulate mitochondrial fusion, in part because 
the structural basis of mitofusin function is not completely understood. Here we 
show that mitofusins adopt either a fusion-constrained or a fusion-permissive
molecular conformation, directed by specific intramolecular binding interactions,
and demonstrate that mitofusin-dependent mitochondrial fusion can be regulated in
mouse cells by targeting these conformational transitions. On the basis of this
model, we engineered a cell-permeant minipeptide to destabilize the
fusion-constrained conformation of mitofusin and promote the fusion-permissive
conformation, reversing mitochondrial abnormalities in cultured fibroblasts and
neurons that harbour CMT2A-associated genetic defects. The relationship between
the conformational plasticity of mitofusin 2 and mitochondrial dynamism reveals a
central mechanism that regulates mitochondrial fusion, the manipulation of which 
can correct mitochondrial pathology triggered by defective or imbalanced
mitochondrial dynamics.

Germ-cell tumours (GCTs) are derived from germ cells and occur most frequently in
the testes. GCTs are histologically heterogeneous and distinctly curable with
chemotherapy. Gains of chromosome arm 12p and aneuploidy are nearly universal in 
GCTs, but specific somatic genomic features driving tumour initiation,
chemosensitivity and progression are incompletely characterized. Here, using
clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of precursor, primary
(testicular and mediastinal) and chemoresistant metastatic human GCTs, we show
that the primary somatic feature of GCTs is highly recurrent chromosome arm level
amplifications and reciprocal deletions (reciprocal loss of heterozygosity),
variations that are significantly enriched in GCTs compared to 19 other cancer
types. These tumours also acquire KRAS mutations during the development from
precursor to primary disease, and primary testicular GCTs (TGCTs) are uniformly
wild type for TP53. In addition, by functional measurement of apoptotic
signalling (BH3 profiling) of fresh tumour and adjacent tissue, we find that
primary TGCTs have high mitochondrial priming that facilitates
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Finally, by phylogenetic analysis of serial TGCTs
that emerge with chemotherapy resistance, we show how TGCTs gain additional
reciprocal loss of heterozygosity and that this is associated with loss of
pluripotency markers (NANOG and POU5F1) in chemoresistant teratomas or
transformed carcinomas. Our results demonstrate the distinct genomic features
underlying the origins of this disease and associated with the chemosensitivity
phenotype, as well as the rare progression to chemoresistance. These results
identify the convergence of cancer genomics, mitochondrial priming and GCT
evolution, and may provide insights into chemosensitivity and resistance in other
cancers.

Ghost imaging is a counter-intuitive phenomenon-first realized in quantum
optics-that enables the image of a two-dimensional object (mask) to be
reconstructed using the spatio-temporal properties of a beam of particles with
which it never interacts. Typically, two beams of correlated photons are used:
one passes through the mask to a single-pixel (bucket) detector while the spatial
profile of the other is measured by a high-resolution (multi-pixel) detector. The
second beam never interacts with the mask. Neither detector can reconstruct the
mask independently, but temporal cross-correlation between the two beams can be
used to recover a 'ghost' image. Here we report the realization of ghost imaging 
using massive particles instead of photons. In our experiment, the two beams are 
formed by correlated pairs of ultracold, metastable helium atoms, which originate
from s-wave scattering of two colliding Bose-Einstein condensates. We use
higher-order Kapitza-Dirac scattering to generate a large number of correlated
atom pairs, enabling the creation of a clear ghost image with submillimetre
resolution. Future extensions of our technique could lead to the realization of
ghost interference, and enable tests of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement and 
Bell's inequalities with atoms.

The majority of the Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If
anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it
could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances
carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these
responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of
warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field
experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the
effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock,
with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this 
empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon
sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections.
Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper
soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of 
carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of
warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil
carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario
would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons 
by 2050. This value is around 12-17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic
emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our
estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across 
all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising
temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere,
driving a positive land carbon-climate feedback that could accelerate climate
change.

In eukaryotes, up to one-third of cellular proteins are targeted to the
endoplasmic reticulum, where they undergo folding, processing, sorting and
trafficking to subsequent endomembrane compartments. Targeting to the endoplasmic
reticulum has been shown to occur co-translationally by the signal recognition
particle (SRP) pathway or post-translationally by the mammalian transmembrane
recognition complex of 40 kDa (TRC40) and homologous yeast guided entry of
tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathways. Despite the range of proteins that can be 
catered for by these two pathways, many proteins are still known to be
independent of both SRP and GET, so there seems to be a critical need for an
additional dedicated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum relay. We set out to
uncover additional targeting proteins using unbiased high-content screening
approaches. To this end, we performed a systematic visual screen using the yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and uncovered three uncharacterized proteins whose loss
affected targeting. We suggest that these proteins work together and demonstrate 
that they function in parallel with SRP and GET to target a broad range of
substrates to the endoplasmic reticulum. The three proteins, which we name Snd1, 
Snd2 and Snd3 (for SRP-independent targeting), can synthetically compensate for
the loss of both the SRP and GET pathways, and act as a backup targeting system. 
This explains why it has previously been difficult to demonstrate complete loss
of targeting for some substrates. Our discovery thus puts in place an essential
piece of the endoplasmic reticulum targeting puzzle, highlighting how the
targeting apparatus of the eukaryotic cell is robust, interlinked and flexible.

Pluto's Sputnik Planitia is a bright, roughly circular feature that resembles a
polar ice cap. It is approximately 1,000 kilometres across and is centred on a
latitude of 25 degrees north and a longitude of 175 degrees, almost directly
opposite the side of Pluto that always faces Charon as a result of tidal locking.
One explanation for its location includes the formation of a basin in a giant
impact, with subsequent upwelling of a dense interior ocean. Once the basin was
established, ice would naturally have accumulated there. Then, provided that the 
basin was a positive gravity anomaly (with or without the ocean), true polar
wander could have moved the feature towards the Pluto-Charon tidal axis, on the
far side of Pluto from Charon. Here we report modelling that shows that ice
quickly accumulates on Pluto near latitudes of 30 degrees north and south, even
in the absence of a basin, because, averaged over its orbital period, those are
Pluto's coldest regions. Within a million years of Charon's formation, ice
deposits on Pluto concentrate into a single cap centred near a latitude of 30
degrees, owing to the runaway albedo effect. This accumulation of ice causes a
positive gravity signature that locks, as Pluto's rotation slows, to a longitude 
directly opposite Charon. Once locked, Charon raises a permanent tidal bulge on
Pluto, which greatly enhances the gravity signature of the ice cap. Meanwhile,
the weight of the ice in Sputnik Planitia causes the crust under it to slump,
creating its own basin (as has happened on Earth in Greenland). Even if the
feature is now a modest negative gravity anomaly, it remains locked in place
because of the permanent tidal bulge raised by Charon. Any movement of the
feature away from 30 degrees latitude is countered by the preferential
recondensation of ices near the coldest extremities of the cap. Therefore, our
modelling suggests that Sputnik Planitia formed shortly after Charon did and has 
been stable, albeit gradually losing volume, over the age of the Solar System.

In tackling the obesity pandemic, significant efforts are devoted to the
development of effective weight reduction strategies, yet many dieting
individuals fail to maintain a long-term weight reduction, and instead undergo
excessive weight regain cycles. The mechanisms driving recurrent post-dieting
obesity remain largely elusive. Here, we identify an intestinal microbiome
signature that persists after successful dieting of obese mice, which contributes
to faster weight regain and metabolic aberrations upon re-exposure to
obesity-promoting conditions and transmits the accelerated weight regain
phenotype upon inter-animal transfer. We develop a machine-learning algorithm
that enables personalized microbiome-based prediction of the extent of
post-dieting weight regain. Additionally, we find that the microbiome contributes
to diminished post-dieting flavonoid levels and reduced energy expenditure, and
demonstrate that flavonoid-based 'post-biotic' intervention ameliorates excessive
secondary weight gain. Together, our data highlight a possible microbiome
contribution to accelerated post-dieting weight regain, and suggest that
microbiome-targeting approaches may help to diagnose and treat this common
disorder.

To make high-performance semiconductor devices, a good ohmic contact between the 
electrode and the semiconductor layer is required to inject the maximum current
density across the contact. Achieving ohmic contacts requires electrodes with
high and low work functions to inject holes and electrons respectively, where the
work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the Fermi
level of the electrode to the vacuum level. However, it is challenging to produce
electrically conducting films with sufficiently high or low work functions,
especially for solution-processed semiconductor devices. Hole-doped polymer
organic semiconductors are available in a limited work-function range, but
hole-doped materials with ultrahigh work functions and, especially,
electron-doped materials with low to ultralow work functions are not yet
available. The key challenges are stabilizing the thin films against de-doping
and suppressing dopant migration. Here we report a general strategy to overcome
these limitations and achieve solution-processed doped films over a wide range of
work functions (3.0-5.8 electronvolts), by charge-doping of conjugated
polyelectrolytes and then internal ion-exchange to give self-compensated heavily 
doped polymers. Mobile carriers on the polymer backbone in these materials are
compensated by covalently bonded counter-ions. Although our self-compensated
doped polymers superficially resemble self-doped polymers, they are generated by 
separate charge-carrier doping and compensation steps, which enables the use of
strong dopants to access extreme work functions. We demonstrate
solution-processed ohmic contacts for high-performance organic light-emitting
diodes, solar cells, photodiodes and transistors, including ohmic injection of
both carrier types into polyfluorene-the benchmark wide-bandgap
blue-light-emitting polymer organic semiconductor. We also show that metal
electrodes can be transformed into highly efficient hole- and electron-injection 
contacts via the self-assembly of these doped polyelectrolytes. This consequently
allows ambipolar field-effect transistors to be transformed into high-performance
p- and n-channel transistors. Our strategy provides a method for producing ohmic 
contacts not only for organic semiconductors, but potentially for other advanced 
semiconductors as well, including perovskites, quantum dots, nanotubes and
two-dimensional materials.

Graphite and other lamellar materials are used as dry lubricants for macroscale
metallic sliding components and high-pressure contacts. It has been shown
experimentally that monolayer graphene exhibits higher friction than multilayer
graphene and graphite, and that this friction increases with continued sliding,
but the mechanism behind this remains subject to debate. It has long been
conjectured that the true contact area between two rough bodies controls
interfacial friction. The true contact area, defined for example by the number of
atoms within the range of interatomic forces, is difficult to visualize directly 
but characterizes the quantity of contact. However, there is emerging evidence
that, for a given pair of materials, the quality of the contact can change, and
that this can also strongly affect interfacial friction. Recently, it has been
found that the frictional behaviour of two-dimensional materials exhibits traits 
unlike those of conventional bulk materials. This includes the abovementioned
finding that for few-layer two-dimensional materials the static friction force
gradually strengthens for a few initial atomic periods before reaching a constant
value. Such transient behaviour, and the associated enhancement of steady-state
friction, diminishes as the number of two-dimensional layers increases, and was
observed only when the two-dimensional material was loosely adhering to a
substrate. This layer-dependent transient phenomenon has not been captured by any
simulations. Here, using atomistic simulations, we reproduce the experimental
observations of layer-dependent friction and transient frictional strengthening
on graphene. Atomic force analysis reveals that the evolution of static friction 
is a manifestation of the natural tendency for thinner and less-constrained
graphene to re-adjust its configuration as a direct consequence of its greater
flexibility. That is, the tip atoms become more strongly pinned, and show greater
synchrony in their stick-slip behaviour. While the quantity of atomic-scale
contacts (true contact area) evolves, the quality (in this case, the local
pinning state of individual atoms and the overall commensurability) also evolves 
in frictional sliding on graphene. Moreover, the effects can be tuned by
pre-wrinkling. The evolving contact quality is critical for explaining the
time-dependent friction of configurationally flexible interfaces.

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) describes the relativistic interaction between the spin
and momentum degrees of freedom of electrons, and is central to the rich
phenomena observed in condensed matter systems. In recent years, new phases of
matter have emerged from the interplay between SOC and low dimensionality, such
as chiral spin textures and spin-polarized surface and interface states. These
low-dimensional SOC-based realizations are typically robust and can be exploited 
at room temperature. Here we discuss SOC as a means of producing such
fundamentally new physical phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. We put
into context the technological promise of these material classes for developing
spin-based device applications at room temperature.

High humidity has a strong influence on the development of numerous diseases
affecting the above-ground parts of plants (the phyllosphere) in crop fields and 
natural ecosystems, but the molecular basis of this humidity effect is not
understood. Previous studies have emphasized immune suppression as a key step in 
bacterial pathogenesis. Here we show that humidity-dependent, pathogen-driven
establishment of an aqueous intercellular space (apoplast) is another important
step in bacterial infection of the phyllosphere. Bacterial effectors, such as
Pseudomonas syringae HopM1, induce establishment of the aqueous apoplast and are 
sufficient to transform non-pathogenic P. syringae strains into virulent
pathogens in immunodeficient Arabidopsis thaliana under high humidity.
Arabidopsis quadruple mutants simultaneously defective in a host target (AtMIN7) 
of HopM1 and in pattern-triggered immunity could not only be used to reconstitute
the basic features of bacterial infection, but also exhibited humidity-dependent 
dyshomeostasis of the endophytic commensal bacterial community in the
phyllosphere. These results highlight a new conceptual framework for
understanding diverse phyllosphere-bacterial interactions.

Epithelial organoids recapitulate multiple aspects of real organs, making them
promising models of organ development, function and disease. However, the full
potential of organoids in research and therapy has remained unrealized, owing to 
the poorly defined animal-derived matrices in which they are grown. Here we used 
modular synthetic hydrogel networks to define the key extracellular matrix (ECM) 
parameters that govern intestinal stem cell (ISC) expansion and organoid
formation, and show that separate stages of the process require different
mechanical environments and ECM components. In particular, fibronectin-based
adhesion was sufficient for ISC survival and proliferation. High matrix stiffness
significantly enhanced ISC expansion through a yes-associated protein 1
(YAP)-dependent mechanism. ISC differentiation and organoid formation, on the
other hand, required a soft matrix and laminin-based adhesion. We used these
insights to build a fully defined culture system for the expansion of mouse and
human ISCs. We also produced mechanically dynamic matrices that were initially
optimal for ISC expansion and subsequently permissive to differentiation and
intestinal organoid formation, thus creating well-defined alternatives to
animal-derived matrices for the culture of mouse and human stem-cell-derived
organoids. Our approach overcomes multiple limitations of current organoid
cultures and greatly expands their applicability in basic and clinical research. 
The principles presented here can be extended to identify designer matrices that 
are optimal for long-term culture of other types of stem cells and organoids.

Mismatched nucleotides arise from polymerase misincorporation errors,
recombination between heteroallelic parents and chemical or physical DNA damage. 
Highly conserved MutS (MSH) and MutL (MLH/PMS) homologues initiate mismatch
repair and, in higher eukaryotes, act as DNA damage sensors that can trigger
apoptosis. Defects in human mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome or
hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and 10-40% of related sporadic
tumours. However, the collaborative mechanics of MSH and MLH/PMS proteins have
not been resolved in any organism. We visualized Escherichia coli (Ec) ensemble
mismatch repair and confirmed that EcMutS mismatch recognition results in the
formation of stable ATP-bound sliding clamps that randomly diffuse along the DNA 
with intermittent backbone contact. The EcMutS sliding clamps act as a platform
to recruit EcMutL onto the mismatched DNA, forming an EcMutS-EcMutL search
complex that then closely follows the DNA backbone. ATP binding by EcMutL
establishes a second long-lived DNA clamp that oscillates between the principal
EcMutS-EcMutL search complex and unrestricted EcMutS and EcMutL sliding clamps.
The EcMutH endonuclease that targets mismatch repair excision only binds clamped 
EcMutL, increasing its DNA association kinetics by more than 1,000-fold. The
assembly of an EcMutS-EcMutL-EcMutH search complex illustrates how sequential
stable sliding clamps can modulate one-dimensional diffusion mechanics along the 
DNA to direct mismatch repair.

Small regulatory RNAs guide Argonaute (Ago) proteins in a sequence-specific
manner to their targets and therefore have important roles in eukaryotic gene
silencing. Of the three small RNA classes, microRNAs and short interfering RNAs
are processed from double-stranded precursors into defined 21- to 23-mers by
Dicer, an endoribonuclease with intrinsic ruler function. PIWI-interacting RNAs
(piRNAs)-the 22-30-nt-long guides for PIWI-clade Ago proteins that silence
transposons in animal gonads-are generated independently of Dicer from
single-stranded precursors. piRNA 5' ends are defined either by Zucchini, the
Drosophila homologue of mitoPLD-a mitochondria-anchored endonuclease, or by
piRNA-guided target cleavage. Formation of piRNA 3' ends is poorly understood.
Here we report that two genetically and mechanistically distinct pathways
generate piRNA 3' ends in Drosophila. The initiating nucleases are either
Zucchini or the PIWI-clade proteins Aubergine (Aub) or Ago3. While
Zucchini-mediated cleavages directly define mature piRNA 3' ends,
Aub/Ago3-mediated cleavages liberate pre-piRNAs that require extensive resection 
by the 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease Nibbler (Drosophila homologue of Mut-7). The
relative activity of these two pathways dictates the extent to which piRNAs are
directed to cytoplasmic or nuclear PIWI-clade proteins and thereby sets the
balance between post-transcriptional and transcriptional silencing. Notably, loss
of both Zucchini and Nibbler reveals a minimal, Argonaute-driven small RNA
biogenesis pathway in which piRNA 5' and 3' ends are directly produced by closely
spaced Aub/Ago3-mediated cleavage events. Our data reveal a coherent model for
piRNA biogenesis, and should aid the mechanistic dissection of the processes that
govern piRNA 3'-end formation.

The universal Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain functions as a signal transduction module
involved in sensing diverse stimuli such as small molecules, light, redox state
and gases. The highly evolvable PAS scaffold can bind a broad range of ligands,
including haem, flavins and metal ions. However, although these ligands can
support catalytic activity, to our knowledge no enzymatic PAS domain has been
found. Here we report characterization of the first PAS enzyme: a haem-dependent 
oxidative N-demethylase. Unrelated to other amine oxidases, this enzyme contains 
haem, flavin mononucleotide, 2Fe-2S and tetrahydrofolic acid cofactors, and
specifically catalyses the NADPH-dependent oxidation of dimethylamine. The
structure of the α subunit reveals that it is a haem-binding PAS domain, similar 
in structure to PAS gas sensors. The dimethylamine substrate forms part of a
highly polarized oxygen-binding site, and directly assists oxygen activation by
acting as both an electron and proton donor. Our data reveal that the ubiquitous 
PAS domain can make the transition from sensor to enzyme, suggesting that the PAS
scaffold can support the development of artificial enzymes.

Mitochondrial products such as ATP, reactive oxygen species, and aspartate are
key regulators of cellular metabolism and growth. Abnormal mitochondrial function
compromises integrated growth-related processes such as development and tissue
repair, as well as homeostatic mechanisms that counteract ageing and
neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Physiologic mechanisms
that control mitochondrial activity in such settings remain incompletely
understood. Here we show that the atypical Fat1 cadherin acts as a molecular
'brake' on mitochondrial respiration that regulates vascular smooth muscle cell
(SMC) proliferation after arterial injury. Fragments of Fat1 accumulate in SMC
mitochondria, and the Fat1 intracellular domain interacts with multiple
mitochondrial proteins, including critical factors associated with the inner
mitochondrial membrane. SMCs lacking Fat1 (Fat1KO) grow faster, consume more
oxygen for ATP production, and contain more aspartate. Notably, expression in
Fat1KO cells of a modified Fat1 intracellular domain that localizes exclusively
to mitochondria largely normalizes oxygen consumption, and the growth advantage
of these cells can be suppressed by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration,
which suggest that a Fat1-mediated growth control mechanism is intrinsic to
mitochondria. Consistent with this idea, Fat1 species associate with multiple
respiratory complexes, and Fat1 deletion both increases the activity of complexes
I and II and promotes the formation of complex-I-containing supercomplexes. In
vivo, Fat1 is expressed in injured human and mouse arteries, and inactivation of 
SMC Fat1 in mice potentiates the response to vascular damage, with markedly
increased medial hyperplasia and neointimal growth, and evidence of higher SMC
mitochondrial respiration. These studies suggest that Fat1 controls mitochondrial
activity to restrain cell growth during the reparative, proliferative state
induced by vascular injury. Given recent reports linking Fat1 to cancer, abnormal
kidney and muscle development, and neuropsychiatric disease, this Fat1 function
may have importance in other settings of altered cell growth and metabolism.

Cellular activity in the brain depends on the high energetic support provided by 
mitochondria, the cell organelles which use energy sources to generate ATP. Acute
cannabinoid intoxication induces amnesia in humans and animals, and the
activation of type-1 cannabinoid receptors present at brain mitochondria
membranes (mtCB1) can directly alter mitochondrial energetic activity. Although
the pathological impact of chronic mitochondrial dysfunctions in the brain is
well established, the involvement of acute modulation of mitochondrial activity
in high brain functions, including learning and memory, is unknown. Here, we show
that acute cannabinoid-induced memory impairment in mice requires activation of
hippocampal mtCB1 receptors. Genetic exclusion of CB1 receptors from hippocampal 
mitochondria prevents cannabinoid-induced reduction of mitochondrial mobility,
synaptic transmission and memory formation. mtCB1 receptors signal through
intra-mitochondrial Gαi protein activation and consequent inhibition of
soluble-adenylyl cyclase (sAC). The resulting inhibition of protein kinase A
(PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of specific subunits of the mitochondrial
electron transport system eventually leads to decreased cellular respiration.
Hippocampal inhibition of sAC activity or manipulation of intra-mitochondrial PKA
signalling or phosphorylation of the Complex I subunit NDUFS2 inhibit
bioenergetic and amnesic effects of cannabinoids. Thus, the G protein-coupled
mtCB1 receptors regulate memory processes via modulation of mitochondrial energy 
metabolism. By directly linking mitochondrial activity to memory formation, these
data reveal that bioenergetic processes are primary acute regulators of cognitive
functions.

Recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes, including 
dendritic cells and macrophages, preserves immune self-tolerance and prevents
chronic inflammation and autoimmune pathologies. The diverse array of phagocytes 
that reside within different tissues, combined with the necessarily prompt nature
of apoptotic cell clearance, makes it difficult to study this process in situ.
The full spectrum of functions executed by tissue-resident phagocytes in response
to homeostatic apoptosis, therefore, remains unclear. Here we show that mouse
apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which undergo continuous renewal to
maintain optimal barrier and absorptive functions, are not merely extruded to
maintain homeostatic cell numbers, but are also sampled by a single subset of
dendritic cells and two macrophage subsets within a well-characterized network of
phagocytes in the small intestinal lamina propria. Characterization of the
transcriptome within each subset before and after in situ sampling of apoptotic
IECs revealed gene expression signatures unique to each phagocyte, including
macrophage-specific lipid metabolism and amino acid catabolism, and a
dendritic-cell-specific program of regulatory CD4+ T-cell activation. A common
'suppression of inflammation' signature was noted, although the specific genes
and pathways involved varied amongst dendritic cells and macrophages, reflecting 
specialized functions. Apoptotic IECs were trafficked to mesenteric lymph nodes
exclusively by the dendritic cell subset and served as critical determinants for 
the induction of tolerogenic regulatory CD4+ T-cell differentiation. Several of
the genes that were differentially expressed by phagocytes bearing apoptotic IECs
overlapped with susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease.
Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the consequences of
apoptotic cell sampling, advance our understanding of how homeostasis is
maintained within the mucosa and set the stage for development of novel
therapeutics to alleviate chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory
bowel disease.

A striking feature of many natural dynamos is their ability to undergo polarity
reversals. The best documented example is Earth's magnetic field, which has
reversed hundreds of times during its history. The origin of geomagnetic polarity
reversals lies in a magnetohydrodynamic process that takes place in Earth's core,
but the precise mechanism is debated. The majority of numerical geodynamo
simulations that exhibit reversals operate in a regime in which the viscosity of 
the fluid remains important, and in which the dynamo mechanism primarily involves
stretching and twisting of field lines by columnar convection. Here we present an
example of another class of reversing-geodynamo model, which operates in a regime
of comparatively low viscosity and high magnetic diffusivity. This class does not
fit into the paradigm of reversal regimes that are dictated by the value of the
local Rossby number (the ratio of advection to Coriolis force). Instead,
stretching of the magnetic field by a strong shear in the east-west flow near the
imaginary cylinder just touching the inner core and parallel to the axis of
rotation is crucial to the reversal mechanism in our models, which involves a
process akin to kinematic dynamo waves. Because our results are relevant in a
regime of low viscosity and high magnetic diffusivity, and with geophysically
appropriate boundary conditions, this form of dynamo wave may also be involved in
geomagnetic reversals.

Professional phagocytes (such as macrophages) and non-professional phagocytes
(such as epithelial cells) clear billions of apoptotic cells and particles on a
daily basis. Although professional and non-professional macrophages reside in
proximity in most tissues, whether they communicate with each other during cell
clearance, and how this might affect inflammation, is not known. Here we show
that macrophages, through the release of a soluble growth factor and
microvesicles, alter the type of particles engulfed by non-professional
phagocytes and influence their inflammatory response. During phagocytosis of
apoptotic cells or in response to inflammation-associated cytokines, macrophages 
released insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The binding of IGF-1 to its
receptor on non-professional phagocytes redirected their phagocytosis, such that 
uptake of larger apoptotic cells was reduced whereas engulfment of microvesicles 
was increased. IGF-1 did not alter engulfment by macrophages. Macrophages also
released microvesicles, whose uptake by epithelial cells was enhanced by IGF-1
and led to decreased inflammatory responses by epithelial cells. Consistent with 
these observations, deletion of IGF-1 receptor in airway epithelial cells led to 
exacerbated lung inflammation after allergen exposure. These genetic and
functional studies reveal that IGF-1- and microvesicle-dependent communication
between macrophages and epithelial cells can critically influence the magnitude
of tissue inflammation in vivo.

In the chemical industry, molecules of interest are based primarily on carbon
skeletons. When synthesizing such molecules, the activation of carbon-carbon
single bonds (C-C bonds) in simple substrates is strategically important: it
offers a way of disconnecting such inert bonds, forming more active linkages (for
example, between carbon and a transition metal) and eventually producing more
versatile scaffolds. The challenge in achieving such activation is the kinetic
inertness of C-C bonds and the relative weakness of newly formed carbon-metal
bonds. The most common tactic starts with a three- or four-membered carbon-ring
system, in which strain release provides a crucial thermodynamic driving force.
However, broadly useful methods that are based on catalytic activation of
unstrained C-C bonds have proven elusive, because the cleavage process is much
less energetically favourable. Here we report a general approach to the catalytic
activation of C-C bonds in simple cyclopentanones and some cyclohexanones. The
key to our success is the combination of a rhodium pre-catalyst, an
N-heterocyclic carbene ligand and an amino-pyridine co-catalyst. When an aryl
group is present in the C3 position of cyclopentanone, the less strained C-C bond
can be activated; this is followed by activation of a carbon-hydrogen bond in the
aryl group, leading to efficient synthesis of functionalized α-tetralones-a
common structural motif and versatile building block in organic synthesis.
Furthermore, this method can substantially enhance the efficiency of the
enantioselective synthesis of some natural products of terpenoids. Density
functional theory calculations reveal a mechanism involving an intriguing
rhodium-bridged bicyclic intermediate.

Mammalian colour patterns are among the most recognizable characteristics found
in nature and can have a profound impact on fitness. However, little is known
about the mechanisms underlying the formation and subsequent evolution of these
patterns. Here we show that, in the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio),
periodic dorsal stripes result from underlying differences in melanocyte
maturation, which give rise to spatial variation in hair colour. We identify the 
transcription factor ALX3 as a regulator of this process. In embryonic dorsal
skin, patterned expression of Alx3 precedes pigment stripes and acts to directly 
repress Mitf, a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation, thereby giving
rise to light-coloured hair. Moreover, Alx3 is upregulated in the light stripes
of chipmunks, which have independently evolved a similar dorsal pattern. Our
results show a previously undescribed mechanism for modulating spatial variation 
in hair colour and provide insights into how phenotypic novelty evolves.

Respiratory chain complexes can super-assemble into quaternary structures called 
supercomplexes that optimize cellular metabolism. The interaction between
complexes III (CIII) and IV (CIV) is modulated by supercomplex assembly factor 1 
(SCAF1, also known as COX7A2L). The discovery of SCAF1 represented strong genetic
evidence that supercomplexes exist in vivo. SCAF1 is present as a long isoform
(113 amino acids) or a short isoform (111 amino acids) in different mouse
strains. Only the long isoform can induce the super-assembly of CIII and CIV, but
it is not clear whether SCAF1 is required for the formation of the respirasome (a
supercomplex of CI, CIII2 and CIV). Here we show, by combining deep proteomics
and immunodetection analysis, that SCAF1 is always required for the interaction
between CIII and CIV and that the respirasome is absent from most tissues of
animals containing the short isoform of SCAF1, with the exception of heart and
skeletal muscle. We used directed mutagenesis to characterize SCAF1 regions that 
interact with CIII and CIV and discovered that this interaction requires the
correct orientation of a histidine residue at position 73 that is altered in the 
short isoform of SCAF1, explaining its inability to interact with CIV.
Furthermore, we find that the CIV subunit COX7A2 is replaced by SCAF1 in
supercomplexes containing CIII and CIV and by COX7A1 in CIV dimers, and that
dimers seem to be more stable when they include COX6A2 rather than the COX6A1
isoform.

Various rod-shaped bacteria mysteriously glide on surfaces in the absence of
appendages such as flagella or pili. In the deltaproteobacterium Myxococcus
xanthus, a putative gliding motility machinery (the Agl-Glt complex) localizes to
so-called focal adhesion sites (FASs) that form stationary contact points with
the underlying surface. Here we show that the Agl-Glt machinery contains an
inner-membrane motor complex that moves intracellularly along a right-handed
helical path; when the machinery becomes stationary at FASs, the motor complex
powers a left-handed rotation of the cell around its long axis. At FASs, force
transmission requires cyclic interactions between the molecular motor and the
adhesion proteins of the outer membrane via a periplasmic interaction platform,
which presumably involves contractile activity of motor components and possible
interactions with peptidoglycan. Our results provide a molecular model of
bacterial gliding motility.

Current knowledge of RNA virus biodiversity is both biased and fragmentary,
reflecting a focus on culturable or disease-causing agents. Here we profile the
transcriptomes of over 220 invertebrate species sampled across nine animal phyla 
and report the discovery of 1,445 RNA viruses, including some that are
sufficiently divergent to comprise new families. The identified viruses fill
major gaps in the RNA virus phylogeny and reveal an evolutionary history that is 
characterized by both host switching and co-divergence. The invertebrate virome
also reveals remarkable genomic flexibility that includes frequent recombination,
lateral gene transfer among viruses and hosts, gene gain and loss, and complex
genomic rearrangements. Together, these data present a view of the RNA virosphere
that is more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than that depicted in
current classification schemes and provide a more solid foundation for studies in
virus ecology and evolution.

Soil pH regulates the capacity of soils to store and supply nutrients, and thus
contributes substantially to controlling productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. 
However, soil pH is not an independent regulator of soil fertility-rather, it is 
ultimately controlled by environmental forcing. In particular, small changes in
water balance cause a steep transition from alkaline to acid soils across natural
climate gradients. Although the processes governing this threshold in soil pH are
well understood, the threshold has not been quantified at the global scale, where
the influence of climate may be confounded by the effects of topography and
mineralogy. Here we evaluate the global relationship between water balance and
soil pH by extracting a spatially random sample (n = 20,000) from an extensive
compilation of 60,291 soil pH measurements. We show that there is an abrupt
transition from alkaline to acid soil pH that occurs at the point where mean
annual precipitation begins to exceed mean annual potential evapotranspiration.
We evaluate deviations from this global pattern, showing that they may result
from seasonality, climate history, erosion and mineralogy. These results
demonstrate that climate creates a nonlinear pattern in soil solution chemistry
at the global scale; they also reveal conditions under which soils maintain pH
out of equilibrium with modern climate.

Thin-film field-effect transistors are essential elements of stretchable
electronic devices for wearable electronics. All of the materials and components 
of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust. Although
there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors, the realization of
stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering
of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers. An
alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically
stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods.
Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing
modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible
molecular building blocks. Here we present a design concept for stretchable
semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote 
dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent 
crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through
breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport
abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect
mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even
after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film
field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as
high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current
ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12
square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction
perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be 
almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we
successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating 
under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device.

The chemistry of aqueous fluids controls the transport and exchange-the cycles-of
metals and volatile elements on Earth. Subduction zones, where oceanic plates
sink into the Earth's interior, are the most important geodynamic setting for
this fluid-mediated chemical exchange. Characterizing the ionic speciation and pH
of fluids equilibrated with rocks at subduction zone conditions has long been a
major challenge in Earth science. Here we report thermodynamic predictions of
fluid-rock equilibria that tie together models of the thermal structure,
mineralogy and fluid speciation of subduction zones. We find that the pH of
fluids in subducted crustal lithologies is confined to a mildly alkaline range,
modulated by rock volatile and chlorine contents. Cold subduction typical of the 
Phanerozoic eon favours the preservation of oxidized carbon in subducting slabs. 
In contrast, the pH of mantle wedge fluids is very sensitive to minor variations 
in rock composition. These variations may be caused by intramantle
differentiation, or by infiltration of fluids enriched in alkali components
extracted from the subducted crust. The sensitivity of pH to soluble elements in 
low abundance in the host rocks, such as carbon, alkali metals and halogens,
illustrates a feedback between the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere-ocean
system and the speciation of subduction zone fluids via the composition of the
seawater-altered oceanic lithosphere. Our findings provide a perspective on the
controlling reactions that have coupled metal and volatile cycles in subduction
zones for more than 3 billion years7.

The effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in
cannabis, are a pressing concern for global mental health. Patterns of cannabis
use are changing drastically owing to legalization, the availability of synthetic
analogues (commonly termed spice), cannavaping and an emphasis on the purported
therapeutic effects of cannabis. Many of the reinforcing effects of THC are
mediated by the dopamine system. Owing to the complexity of the
cannabinoid-dopamine interactions that take place, there is conflicting evidence 
from human and animal studies concerning the effects of THC on the dopamine
system. Acute THC administration causes increased dopamine release and neuron
activity, whereas long-term use is associated with blunting of the dopamine
system. Future research must examine the long-term and developmental dopaminergic
effects of THC.

Recent clinical trials using immunotherapy have demonstrated its potential to
control cancer by disinhibiting the immune system. Immune checkpoint blocking
(ICB) antibodies against cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 or
programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 have displayed durable 
clinical responses in various cancers. Although these new immunotherapies have
had a notable effect on cancer treatment, multiple mechanisms of immune
resistance exist in tumours. Among the key mechanisms, myeloid cells have a major
role in limiting effective tumour immunity. Growing evidence suggests that high
infiltration of immune-suppressive myeloid cells correlates with poor prognosis
and ICB resistance. These observations suggest a need for a precision medicine
approach in which the design of the immunotherapeutic combination is modified on 
the basis of the tumour immune landscape to overcome such resistance mechanisms. 
Here we employ a pre-clinical mouse model system and show that resistance to ICB 
is directly mediated by the suppressive activity of infiltrating myeloid cells in
various tumours. Furthermore, selective pharmacologic targeting of the gamma
isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kγ), highly expressed in myeloid cells, 
restores sensitivity to ICB. We demonstrate that targeting PI3Kγ with a selective
inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02637531),
can reshape the tumour immune microenvironment and promote
cytotoxic-T-cell-mediated tumour regression without targeting cancer cells
directly. Our results introduce opportunities for new combination strategies
using a selective small molecule PI3Kγ inhibitor, such as IPI-549, to overcome
resistance to ICB in patients with high levels of suppressive myeloid cell
infiltration in tumours.

Astrocytes associate with synapses throughout the brain and express receptors for
neurotransmitters that can increase intracellular calcium (Ca2+). Astrocytic Ca2+
signalling has been proposed to modulate neural circuit activity, but the
pathways that regulate these events are poorly defined and in vivo evidence
linking changes in astrocyte Ca2+ levels to alterations in neurotransmission or
behaviour is limited. Here we show that Drosophila astrocytes exhibit
activity-regulated Ca2+ signalling in vivo. Tyramine and octopamine released from
neurons expressing tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) signal directly to astrocytes 
to stimulate Ca2+ increases through the octopamine/tyramine receptor (Oct-TyrR)
and the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel Water witch (Wtrw), and
astrocytes in turn modulate downstream dopaminergic neurons. Application of
tyramine or octopamine to live preparations silenced dopaminergic neurons and
this inhibition required astrocytic Oct-TyrR and Wtrw. Increasing astrocyte Ca2+ 
signalling was sufficient to silence dopaminergic neuron activity, which was
mediated by astrocyte endocytic function and adenosine receptors. Selective
disruption of Oct-TyrR or Wtrw expression in astrocytes blocked astrocytic Ca2+
signalling and profoundly altered olfactory-driven chemotaxis and touch-induced
startle responses. Our work identifies Oct-TyrR and Wtrw as key components of the
astrocytic Ca2+ signalling machinery, provides direct evidence that octopamine-
and tyramine-based neuromodulation can be mediated by astrocytes, and
demonstrates that astrocytes are essential for multiple sensory-driven behaviours
in Drosophila.

The β-haemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassaemia, are
caused by mutations in the β-globin (HBB) gene and affect millions of people
worldwide. Ex vivo gene correction in patient-derived haematopoietic stem cells
followed by autologous transplantation could be used to cure
β-haemoglobinopathies. Here we present a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system that
combines Cas9 ribonucleoproteins and adeno-associated viral vector delivery of a 
homologous donor to achieve homologous recombination at the HBB gene in
haematopoietic stem cells. Notably, we devise an enrichment model to purify a
population of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with more than 90%
targeted integration. We also show efficient correction of the Glu6Val mutation
responsible for sickle cell disease by using patient-derived stem and progenitor 
cells that, after differentiation into erythrocytes, express adult β-globin (HbA)
messenger RNA, which confirms intact transcriptional regulation of edited HBB
alleles. Collectively, these preclinical studies outline a CRISPR-based
methodology for targeting haematopoietic stem cells by homologous recombination
at the HBB locus to advance the development of next-generation therapies for
β-haemoglobinopathies.

Sleep is conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, and is tightly regulated in
a homeostatic manner. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that determine the
amount of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS (NREMS) remain unknown.
Here we identify two dominant mutations that affect sleep and wakefulness by
using an electroencephalogram/electromyogram-based screen of randomly mutagenized
mice. A splicing mutation in the Sik3 protein kinase gene causes a profound
decrease in total wake time, owing to an increase in inherent sleep need. Sleep
deprivation affects phosphorylation of regulatory sites on the kinase, suggesting
a role for SIK3 in the homeostatic regulation of sleep amount. Sik3 orthologues
also regulate sleep in fruitflies and roundworms. A missense, gain-of-function
mutation in the sodium leak channel NALCN reduces the total amount and episode
duration of REMS, apparently by increasing the excitability of REMS-inhibiting
neurons. Our results substantiate the use of a forward-genetics approach for
studying sleep behaviours in mice, and demonstrate the role of SIK3 and NALCN in 
regulating the amount of NREMS and REMS, respectively.

Intermediary metabolism generates substrates for chromatin modification, enabling
the potential coupling of metabolic and epigenetic states. Here we identify a
network linking metabolic and epigenetic alterations that is central to oncogenic
transformation downstream of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as STK11)
tumour suppressor, an integrator of nutrient availability, metabolism and growth.
By developing genetically engineered mouse models and primary pancreatic
epithelial cells, and employing transcriptional, proteomics, and metabolic
analyses, we find that oncogenic cooperation between LKB1 loss and KRAS
activation is fuelled by pronounced mTOR-dependent induction of the
serine-glycine-one-carbon pathway coupled to S-adenosylmethionine generation. At 
the same time, DNA methyltransferases are upregulated, leading to elevation in
DNA methylation with particular enrichment at retrotransposon elements associated
with their transcriptional silencing. Correspondingly, LKB1 deficiency sensitizes
cells and tumours to inhibition of serine biosynthesis and DNA methylation. Thus,
we define a hypermetabolic state that incites changes in the epigenetic landscape
to support tumorigenic growth of LKB1-mutant cells, while resulting in potential 
therapeutic vulnerabilities.

In the giant-impact hypothesis for lunar origin, the Moon accreted from an
equatorial circum-terrestrial disk; however, the current lunar orbital
inclination of five degrees requires a subsequent dynamical process that is still
unclear. In addition, the giant-impact theory has been challenged by the Moon's
unexpectedly Earth-like isotopic composition. Here we show that tidal dissipation
due to lunar obliquity was an important effect during the Moon's tidal evolution,
and the lunar inclination in the past must have been very large, defying
theoretical explanations. We present a tidal evolution model starting with the
Moon in an equatorial orbit around an initially fast-spinning, high-obliquity
Earth, which is a probable outcome of giant impacts. Using numerical modelling,
we show that the solar perturbations on the Moon's orbit naturally induce a large
lunar inclination and remove angular momentum from the Earth-Moon system. Our
tidal evolution model supports recent high-angular-momentum, giant-impact
scenarios to explain the Moon's isotopic composition and provides a new pathway
to reach Earth's climatically favourable low obliquity.

Energy dissipation is a fundamental process governing the dynamics of physical,
chemical and biological systems. It is also one of the main characteristics that 
distinguish quantum from classical phenomena. In particular, in condensed matter 
physics, scattering mechanisms, loss of quantum information or breakdown of
topological protection are deeply rooted in the intricate details of how and
where the dissipation occurs. Yet the microscopic behaviour of a system is
usually not formulated in terms of dissipation because energy dissipation is not 
a readily measurable quantity on the micrometre scale. Although nanoscale
thermometry has gained much recent interest, existing thermal imaging methods are
not sensitive enough for the study of quantum systems and are also unsuitable for
the low-temperature operation that is required. Here we report a nano-thermometer
based on a superconducting quantum interference device with a diameter of less
than 50 nanometres that resides at the apex of a sharp pipette: it provides
scanning cryogenic thermal sensing that is four orders of magnitude more
sensitive than previous devices-below 1 μK Hz-1/2. This non-contact, non-invasive
thermometry allows thermal imaging of very low intensity, nanoscale energy
dissipation down to the fundamental Landauer limit of 40 femtowatts for
continuous readout of a single qubit at one gigahertz at 4.2 kelvin. These
advances enable the observation of changes in dissipation due to single-electron 
charging of individual quantum dots in carbon nanotubes. They also reveal a
dissipation mechanism attributable to resonant localized states in graphene
encapsulated within hexagonal boron nitride, opening the door to direct thermal
imaging of nanoscale dissipation processes in quantum matter.

Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed to produce thousands of long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). A few of these lncRNAs have been shown to recruit
regulatory complexes through RNA-protein interactions to influence the expression
of nearby genes, and it has been suggested that many other lncRNAs can also act
as local regulators. Such local functions could explain the observation that
lncRNA expression is often correlated with the expression of nearby genes.
However, these correlations have been challenging to dissect and could
alternatively result from processes that are not mediated by the lncRNA
transcripts themselves. For example, some gene promoters have been proposed to
have dual functions as enhancers, and the process of transcription itself may
contribute to gene regulation by recruiting activating factors or remodelling
nucleosomes. Here we use genetic manipulation in mouse cell lines to dissect 12
genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and find that 5 of these loci influence the
expression of a neighbouring gene in cis. Notably, none of these effects requires
the specific lncRNA transcripts themselves and instead involves general processes
associated with their production, including enhancer-like activity of gene
promoters, the process of transcription, and the splicing of the transcript.
Furthermore, such effects are not limited to lncRNA loci: we find that four out
of six protein-coding loci also influence the expression of a neighbour. These
results demonstrate that cross-talk among neighbouring genes is a prevalent
phenomenon that can involve multiple mechanisms and cis-regulatory signals,
including a role for RNA splice sites. These mechanisms may explain the function 
and evolution of some genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and broadly contribute to
the regulation of both coding and non-coding genes.

The Hsp70 system is a central hub of chaperone activity in all domains of life.
Hsp70 performs a plethora of tasks, including folding assistance, protection
against aggregation, protein trafficking, and enzyme activity regulation, and
interacts with non-folded chains, as well as near-native, misfolded, and
aggregated proteins. Hsp70 is thought to achieve its many physiological roles by 
binding peptide segments that extend from these different protein conformers
within a groove that can be covered by an ATP-driven helical lid. However, it has
been difficult to test directly how Hsp70 interacts with protein substrates in
different stages of folding and how it affects their structure. Moreover, recent 
indications of diverse lid conformations in Hsp70-substrate complexes raise the
possibility of additional interaction mechanisms. Addressing these issues is
technically challenging, given the conformational dynamics of both chaperone and 
client, the transient nature of their interaction, and the involvement of
co-chaperones and the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Here, using optical tweezers, we show
that the bacterial Hsp70 homologue (DnaK) binds and stabilizes not only extended 
peptide segments, but also partially folded and near-native protein structures.
The Hsp70 lid and groove act synergistically when stabilizing folded structures: 
stabilization is abolished when the lid is truncated and less efficient when the 
groove is mutated. The diversity of binding modes has important consequences:
Hsp70 can both stabilize and destabilize folded structures, in a
nucleotide-regulated manner; like Hsp90 and GroEL, Hsp70 can affect the late
stages of protein folding; and Hsp70 can suppress aggregation by protecting
partially folded structures as well as unfolded protein chains. Overall, these
findings in the DnaK system indicate an extension of the Hsp70 canonical model
that potentially affects a wide range of physiological roles of the Hsp70 system.

HAND2 is an ancestral regulator of heart development and one of four
transcription factors that control the reprogramming of fibroblasts into
cardiomyocytes. Deletion of Hand2 in mice results in right ventricle hypoplasia
and embryonic lethality. Hand2 expression is tightly regulated by upstream
enhancers that reside within a super-enhancer delineated by histone H3 acetyl
Lys27 (H3K27ac) modifications. Here we show that transcription of a
Hand2-associated long non-coding RNA, which we named upperhand (Uph), is required
to maintain the super-enhancer signature and elongation of RNA polymerase II
through the Hand2 enhancer locus. Blockade of Uph transcription, but not
knockdown of the mature transcript, abolished Hand2 expression, causing right
ventricular hypoplasia and embryonic lethality in mice. Given the substantial
number of uncharacterized promoter-associated long non-coding RNAs encoded by the
mammalian genome, the Uph-Hand2 regulatory partnership offers a mechanism by
which divergent non-coding transcription can establish a permissive chromatin
environment.

The nucleation of atmospheric vapours is an important source of new aerosol
particles that can subsequently grow to form cloud condensation nuclei in the
atmosphere. Most field studies of atmospheric aerosols over continents are
influenced by atmospheric vapours of anthropogenic origin (for example, ref. 2)
and, in consequence, aerosol processes in pristine, terrestrial environments
remain poorly understood. The Amazon rainforest is one of the few continental
regions where aerosol particles and their precursors can be studied under
near-natural conditions, but the origin of small aerosol particles that grow into
cloud condensation nuclei in the Amazon boundary layer remains unclear. Here we
present aircraft- and ground-based measurements under clean conditions during the
wet season in the central Amazon basin. We find that high concentrations of small
aerosol particles (with diameters of less than 50 nanometres) in the lower free
troposphere are transported from the free troposphere into the boundary layer
during precipitation events by strong convective downdrafts and weaker downward
motions in the trailing stratiform region. This rapid vertical transport can help
to maintain the population of particles in the pristine Amazon boundary layer,
and may therefore influence cloud properties and climate under natural
conditions.

The anaerobic formation and oxidation of methane involve unique enzymatic
mechanisms and cofactors, all of which are believed to be specific for
C1-compounds. Here we show that an anaerobic thermophilic enrichment culture
composed of dense consortia of archaea and bacteria apparently uses partly
similar pathways to oxidize the C4 hydrocarbon butane. The archaea, proposed
genus 'Candidatus Syntrophoarchaeum', show the characteristic autofluorescence of
methanogens, and contain highly expressed genes encoding enzymes similar to
methyl-coenzyme M reductase. We detect butyl-coenzyme M, indicating archaeal
butane activation analogous to the first step in anaerobic methane oxidation. In 
addition, Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum expresses the genes encoding β-oxidation enzymes,
carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and reversible C1 methanogenesis enzymes. This
allows for the complete oxidation of butane. Reducing equivalents are seemingly
channelled to HotSeep-1, a thermophilic sulfate-reducing partner bacterium known 
from the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Genes encoding 16S rRNA and
methyl-coenzyme M reductase similar to those identifying Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum
were repeatedly retrieved from marine subsurface sediments, suggesting that the
presented activation mechanism is naturally widespread in the anaerobic oxidation
of short-chain hydrocarbons.

The performance and population dynamics of insect herbivores depend on the
nutritive and defensive traits of their host plants. The literature on
plant-herbivore interactions focuses on plant trait mean values, but recent
studies showing the importance of plant genetic diversity for herbivores suggest 
that plant trait variance may be equally important. The consequences of plant
trait variance for herbivore performance, however, have been largely overlooked. 
Here we report an extensive assessment of the effects of within-population plant 
trait variance on herbivore performance using 457 performance datasets from 53
species of insect herbivores. We show that variance in plant nutritive traits
substantially reduces mean herbivore performance via non-linear averaging of
performance relationships that were overwhelmingly concave down. By contrast,
relationships between herbivore performance and plant defence levels were
typically linear, with variance in plant defence not affecting herbivore
performance via non-linear averaging. Our results demonstrate that plants
contribute to the suppression of herbivore populations through variable nutrient 
levels, not just by having low average quality as is typically thought. We
propose that this phenomenon could play a key role in the suppression of
herbivore populations in natural systems, and that increased nutrient
heterogeneity within agricultural crops could contribute to the sustainable
control of insect pests in agroecosystems.

Macrophages play critical, but opposite, roles in acute and chronic inflammation 
and cancer. In response to pathogens or injury, inflammatory macrophages express 
cytokines that stimulate cytotoxic T cells, whereas macrophages in neoplastic and
parasitic diseases express anti-inflammatory cytokines that induce immune
suppression and may promote resistance to T cell checkpoint inhibitors. Here we
show that macrophage PI 3-kinase γ controls a critical switch between immune
stimulation and suppression during inflammation and cancer. PI3Kγ signalling
through Akt and mTor inhibits NFκB activation while stimulating C/EBPβ
activation, thereby inducing a transcriptional program that promotes immune
suppression during inflammation and tumour growth. By contrast, selective
inactivation of macrophage PI3Kγ stimulates and prolongs NFκB activation and
inhibits C/EBPβ activation, thus promoting an immunostimulatory transcriptional
program that restores CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity. PI3Kγ synergizes
with checkpoint inhibitor therapy to promote tumour regression and increased
survival in mouse models of cancer. In addition, PI3Kγ-directed,
anti-inflammatory gene expression can predict survival probability in cancer
patients. Our work thus demonstrates that therapeutic targeting of intracellular 
signalling pathways that regulate the switch between macrophage polarization
states can control immune suppression in cancer and other disorders.

The human cannabinoid G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) CB1 and CB2 mediate the
functional responses to the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonyl
glycerol (2-AG), as well as the widely consumed plant (phyto)cannabinoid
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)1. The cannabinoid receptors have been the targets
of intensive drug discovery efforts owing to the therapeutic potential of
modulators for controlling pain2, epilepsy3, obesity4, and other maladies.
Although much progress has recently been made in understanding the biophysical
properties of GPCRs, investigations of the molecular mechanisms of the
cannabinoids and their receptors have lacked high-resolution structural data. We 
used GPCR engineering and lipidic cubic phase (LCP) crystallization to determine 
the structure of the human CB1 receptor bound to the inhibitor taranabant at
2.6 Å resolution. The extracellular surface of CB1, including the highly
conserved membrane-proximal amino-terminal (N-terminal) region, is distinct from 
other lipid-activated GPCRs and forms a critical part of the ligand binding
pocket. Docking studies further demonstrate how this same pocket may accommodate 
the cannabinoid agonist THC. Our CB1 structure provides an atomic framework for
studying cannabinoid receptor function, and will aid the design and optimization 
of cannabinoid system modulators for therapeutic ends.

RNA polymerase I (Pol I) is a highly processive enzyme that transcribes ribosomal
DNA (rDNA) and regulates growth of eukaryotic cells. Crystal structures of free
Pol I from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed dimers of the enzyme 
stabilized by a 'connector' element and an expanded cleft containing the active
centre in an inactive conformation. The central bridge helix was unfolded and a
Pol-I-specific 'expander' element occupied the DNA-template-binding site. The
structure of Pol I in its active transcribing conformation has yet to be
determined, whereas structures of Pol II and Pol III have been solved with bound 
DNA template and RNA transcript. Here we report structures of active transcribing
Pol I from yeast solved by two different cryo-electron microscopy approaches. A
single-particle structure at 3.8 Å resolution reveals a contracted active centre 
cleft with bound DNA and RNA, and a narrowed pore beneath the active site that no
longer holds the RNA-cleavage-stimulating domain of subunit A12.2. A structure at
29 Å resolution that was determined from cryo-electron tomograms of Pol I enzymes
transcribing cellular rDNA confirms contraction of the cleft and reveals that
incoming and exiting rDNA enclose an angle of around 150°. The structures suggest
a model for the regulation of transcription elongation in which contracted and
expanded polymerase conformations are associated with active and inactive states,
respectively.

Although systemic diseases take the biggest toll on human health and well-being, 
increasingly, a failing brain is the arbiter of a death preceded by a gradual
loss of the essence of being. Ageing, which is fundamental to neurodegeneration
and dementia, affects every organ in the body and seems to be encoded partly in a
blood-based signature. Indeed, factors in the circulation have been shown to
modulate ageing and to rejuvenate numerous organs, including the brain. The
discovery of such factors, the identification of their origins and a deeper
understanding of their functions is ushering in a new era in ageing and dementia 
research.

Self-bound many-body systems are formed through a balance of attractive and
repulsive forces and occur in many physical scenarios. Liquid droplets are an
example of a self-bound system, formed by a balance of the mutual attractive and 
repulsive forces that derive from different components of the inter-particle
potential. It has been suggested that self-bound ensembles of ultracold atoms
should exist for atom number densities that are 108 times lower than in a helium 
droplet, which is formed from a dense quantum liquid. However, such ensembles
have been elusive up to now because they require forces other than the usual
zero-range contact interaction, which is either attractive or repulsive but never
both. On the basis of the recent finding that an unstable bosonic dipolar gas can
be stabilized by a repulsive many-body term, it was predicted that
three-dimensional self-bound quantum droplets of magnetic atoms should exist.
Here we report the observation of such droplets in a trap-free levitation field. 
We find that this dilute magnetic quantum liquid requires a minimum, critical
number of atoms, below which the liquid evaporates into an expanding gas as a
result of the quantum pressure of the individual constituents. Consequently,
around this critical atom number we observe an interaction-driven phase
transition between a gas and a self-bound liquid in the quantum degenerate regime
with ultracold atoms. These droplets are the dilute counterpart of strongly
correlated self-bound systems such as atomic nuclei and helium droplets.

The aggregation of proteins into structures known as amyloids is observed in many
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Amyloids are composed 
of pairs of tightly interacting, many stranded and repetitive intermolecular
β-sheets, which form the cross-β-sheet structure. This structure enables amyloids
to grow by recruitment of the same protein and its repetition can transform a
weak biological activity into a potent one through cooperativity and avidity.
Amyloids therefore have the potential to self-replicate and can adapt to the
environment, yielding cell-to-cell transmissibility, prion infectivity and
toxicity.

Spinal cord injury disrupts the communication between the brain and the spinal
circuits that orchestrate movement. To bypass the lesion, brain-computer
interfaces have directly linked cortical activity to electrical stimulation of
muscles, and have thus restored grasping abilities after hand paralysis.
Theoretically, this strategy could also restore control over leg muscle activity 
for walking. However, replicating the complex sequence of individual muscle
activation patterns underlying natural and adaptive locomotor movements poses
formidable conceptual and technological challenges. Recently, it was shown in
rats that epidural electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord can reproduce
the natural activation of synergistic muscle groups producing locomotion. Here we
interface leg motor cortex activity with epidural electrical stimulation
protocols to establish a brain-spine interface that alleviated gait deficits
after a spinal cord injury in non-human primates. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)
were implanted with an intracortical microelectrode array in the leg area of the 
motor cortex and with a spinal cord stimulation system composed of a spatially
selective epidural implant and a pulse generator with real-time triggering
capabilities. We designed and implemented wireless control systems that linked
online neural decoding of extension and flexion motor states with stimulation
protocols promoting these movements. These systems allowed the monkeys to behave 
freely without any restrictions or constraining tethered electronics. After
validation of the brain-spine interface in intact (uninjured) monkeys, we
performed a unilateral corticospinal tract lesion at the thoracic level. As early
as six days post-injury and without prior training of the monkeys, the
brain-spine interface restored weight-bearing locomotion of the paralysed leg on 
a treadmill and overground. The implantable components integrated in the
brain-spine interface have all been approved for investigational applications in 
similar human research, suggesting a practical translational pathway for
proof-of-concept studies in people with spinal cord injury.

Tracking the ultrafast motion of a single molecule by femtosecond orbital
imaging.

Watching a single molecule move on its intrinsic timescale has been one of the
central goals of modern nanoscience, and calls for measurements that combine
ultrafast temporal resolution with atomic spatial resolution. Steady-state
experiments access the requisite spatial scales, as illustrated by direct imaging
of individual molecular orbitals using scanning tunnelling microscopy or the
acquisition of tip-enhanced Raman and luminescence spectra with sub-molecular
resolution. But tracking the intrinsic dynamics of a single molecule directly in 
the time domain faces the challenge that interactions with the molecule must be
confined to a femtosecond time window. For individual nanoparticles, such
ultrafast temporal confinement has been demonstrated by combining scanning
tunnelling microscopy with so-called lightwave electronics, which uses the
oscillating carrier wave of tailored light pulses to directly manipulate
electronic motion on timescales faster even than a single cycle of light. Here we
build on ultrafast terahertz scanning tunnelling microscopy to access a
state-selective tunnelling regime, where the peak of a terahertz electric-field
waveform transiently opens an otherwise forbidden tunnelling channel through a
single molecular state. It thereby removes a single electron from an individual
pentacene molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital within a time window
shorter than one oscillation cycle of the terahertz wave. We exploit this effect 
to record approximately 100-femtosecond snapshot images of the orbital structure 
with sub-ångström spatial resolution, and to reveal, through pump/probe
measurements, coherent molecular vibrations at terahertz frequencies directly in 
the time domain. We anticipate that the combination of lightwave electronics and 
the atomic resolution of our approach will open the door to visualizing ultrafast

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and uniformly fatal
neurodegenerative disease. A plethora of genetic factors have been identified
that drive the degeneration of motor neurons in ALS, increase susceptibility to
the disease or influence the rate of its progression. Emerging themes include
dysfunction in RNA metabolism and protein homeostasis, with specific defects in
nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, the induction of stress at the endoplasmic
reticulum and impaired dynamics of ribonucleoprotein bodies such as RNA granules 
that assemble through liquid-liquid phase separation. Extraordinary progress in
understanding the biology of ALS provides new reasons for optimism that
meaningful therapies will be identified.

Sensory stimuli drive the maturation and function of the mammalian nervous system
in part through the activation of gene expression networks that regulate synapse 
development and plasticity. These networks have primarily been studied in mice,
and it is not known whether there are species- or clade-specific
activity-regulated genes that control features of brain development and function.
Here we use transcriptional profiling of human fetal brain cultures to identify
an activity-dependent secreted factor, Osteocrin (OSTN), that is induced by
membrane depolarization of human but not mouse neurons. We find that OSTN has
been repurposed in primates through the evolutionary acquisition of DNA
regulatory elements that bind the activity-regulated transcription factor MEF2.
In addition, we demonstrate that OSTN is expressed in primate neocortex and
restricts activity-dependent dendritic growth in human neurons. These findings
suggest that, in response to sensory input, OSTN regulates features of neuronal
structure and function that are unique to primates.

Prions are notorious protein-only infectious agents that cause invariably fatal
brain diseases following silent incubation periods that can span a lifetime.
These diseases can arise spontaneously, through infection or be inherited.
Remarkably, prions are composed of self-propagating assemblies of a misfolded
cellular protein that encode information, generate neurotoxicity and evolve and
adapt in vivo. Although parallels have been drawn with Alzheimer's disease and
other neurodegenerative conditions involving the deposition of assemblies of
misfolded proteins in the brain, insights are now being provided into the
usefulness and limitations of prion analogies and their aetiological and
therapeutic relevance.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive loss of memory and cognition, for which
there is no cure. Although genetic studies initially suggested a primary role for
amyloid-in Alzheimer's disease, treatment strategies targeted at reducing
amyloid-have failed to reverse cognitive symptoms. These clinical findings
suggest that cognitive decline is the result of a complex pathophysiology and
that targeting amyloid-alone may not be sufficient to treat Alzheimer's disease. 
Instead, a broad outlook on neural-circuit-damaging processes may yield insights 
into new therapeutic strategies for curing memory loss in the disease.

Parkinson's disease is a debilitating, age-associated movement disorder. A
central aspect of the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is the progressive
demise of midbrain dopamine neurons and their axonal projections, but the
underlying causes of this loss are unclear. Advances in genetics and experimental
model systems have illuminated an important role for defects in intracellular
transport pathways to lysosomes. The accumulation of altered proteins and damaged
mitochondria, particularly at axon terminals, ultimately might overwhelm the
capacity of intracellular disposal mechanisms. Cell-extrinsic mechanisms,
including inflammation and prion-like spreading, are proposed to have both
protective and deleterious functions in Parkinson's disease.

Elucidating the material culture of early people in arid Australia and the nature
of their environmental interactions is essential for understanding the
adaptability of populations and the potential causes of megafaunal extinctions
50-40 thousand years ago (ka). Humans colonized the continent by 50 ka, but an
apparent lack of cultural innovations compared to people in Europe and Africa has
been deemed a barrier to early settlement in the extensive arid zone. Here we
present evidence from Warratyi rock shelter in the southern interior that shows
that humans occupied arid Australia by around 49 ka, 10 thousand years (kyr)
earlier than previously reported. The site preserves the only reliably dated,
stratified evidence of extinct Australian megafauna, including the giant
marsupial Diprotodon optatum, alongside artefacts more than 46 kyr old. We also
report on the earliest-known use of ochre in Australia and Southeast Asia (at or 
before 49-46 ka), gypsum pigment (40-33 ka), bone tools (40-38 ka), hafted tools 
(38-35 ka), and backed artefacts (30-24 ka), each up to 10 kyr older than any
other known occurrence. Thus, our evidence shows that people not only settled in 
the arid interior within a few millennia of entering the continent, but also
developed key technologies much earlier than previously recorded for Australia
and Southeast Asia.

Dietary fat promotes pathological insulin resistance through chronic
inflammation. The inactivation of inflammatory proteins produced by macrophages
improves diet-induced diabetes, but how nutrient-dense diets induce diabetes is
unknown. Membrane lipids affect the innate immune response, which requires
domains that influence high-fat-diet-induced chronic inflammation and alter cell 
function based on phospholipid composition. Endogenous fatty acid synthesis,
mediated by fatty acid synthase (FAS), affects membrane composition. Here we show
that macrophage FAS is indispensable for diet-induced inflammation. Deleting Fasn
in macrophages prevents diet-induced insulin resistance, recruitment of
macrophages to adipose tissue and chronic inflammation in mice. We found that FAS
deficiency alters membrane order and composition, impairing the retention of
plasma membrane cholesterol and disrupting Rho GTPase trafficking-a process
required for cell adhesion, migration and activation. Expression of a
constitutively active Rho GTPase, however, restored inflammatory signalling.
Exogenous palmitate was partitioned to different pools from endogenous lipids and
did not rescue inflammatory signalling. However, exogenous cholesterol, as well
as other planar sterols, did rescue signalling, with cholesterol restoring
FAS-induced perturbations in membrane order. Our results show that the production
of endogenous fat in macrophages is necessary for the development of
exogenous-fat-induced insulin resistance through the creation of a receptive
environment at the plasma membrane for the assembly of cholesterol-dependent
signalling networks.

Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells,
evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental
pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive
tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for
CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single
cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide
expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along
two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is
undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells
with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare
subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible
for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number
variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar
cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is
primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis
supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to 
definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred
hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular
architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the
cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.

The optimal foraging strategy in a given environment depends on the number of
competing individuals and their behavioural strategies. Little is known about the
genes and neural circuits that integrate social information into foraging
decisions. Here we show that ascaroside pheromones, small glycolipids that signal
population density, suppress exploratory foraging in Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
that heritable variation in this behaviour generates alternative foraging
strategies. We find that natural C. elegans isolates differ in their sensitivity 
to the potent ascaroside icas#9 (IC-asc-C5). A quantitative trait locus (QTL)
regulating icas#9 sensitivity includes srx-43, a G-protein-coupled icas#9
receptor that acts in the ASI class of sensory neurons to suppress exploration.
Two ancient haplotypes associated with this QTL confer competitive growth
advantages that depend on ascaroside secretion, its detection by srx-43 and the
distribution of food. These results suggest that balancing selection at the
srx-43 locus generates alternative density-dependent behaviours, fulfilling a
prediction of foraging game theory.

Germline activating mutations of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (encoded
by PTPN11), a positive regulator of the RAS signalling pathway, are found in 50% 
of patients with Noonan syndrome. These patients have an increased risk of
developing leukaemia, especially juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a
childhood myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Previous studies have demonstrated
that mutations in Ptpn11 induce a JMML-like MPN through cell-autonomous
mechanisms that are dependent on Shp2 catalytic activity. However, the effect of 
these mutations in the bone marrow microenvironment remains unclear. Here we
report that Ptpn11 activating mutations in the mouse bone marrow microenvironment
promote the development and progression of MPN through profound detrimental
effects on haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Ptpn11 mutations in mesenchymal
stem/progenitor cells and osteoprogenitors, but not in differentiated osteoblasts
or endothelial cells, cause excessive production of the CC chemokine CCL3 (also
known as MIP-1α), which recruits monocytes to the area in which HSCs also reside.
Consequently, HSCs are hyperactivated by interleukin-1β and possibly other
proinflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes, leading to exacerbated MPN and
to donor-cell-derived MPN following stem cell transplantation. Remarkably,
administration of CCL3 receptor antagonists effectively reverses MPN development 
induced by the Ptpn11-mutated bone marrow microenvironment. This study reveals
the critical contribution of Ptpn11 mutations in the bone marrow microenvironment
to leukaemogenesis and identifies CCL3 as a potential therapeutic target for
controlling leukaemic progression in Noonan syndrome and for improving stem cell 
transplantation therapy in Noonan-syndrome-associated leukaemias.

The ability of the adult mammalian brain to compensate for neuronal loss caused
by injury or disease is very limited. Transplantation aims to replace lost
neurons, but the extent to which new neurons can integrate into existing circuits
is unknown. Here, using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging, we show that
embryonic neurons transplanted into the visual cortex of adult mice mature into
bona fide pyramidal cells with selective pruning of basal dendrites, achieving
adult-like densities of dendritic spines and axonal boutons within 4-8 weeks.
Monosynaptic tracing experiments reveal that grafted neurons receive
area-specific, afferent inputs matching those of pyramidal neurons in the normal 
visual cortex, including topographically organized geniculo-cortical connections.
Furthermore, stimulus-selective responses refine over the course of many weeks
and finally become indistinguishable from those of host neurons. Thus, grafted
neurons can integrate with great specificity into neocortical circuits that
normally never incorporate new neurons in the adult brain.

The world's rivers deliver 19 billion tonnes of sediment to the coastal zone
annually, with a considerable fraction being sequestered in large deltas, home to
over 500 million people. Most (more than 70 per cent) large deltas are under
threat from a combination of rising sea levels, ground surface subsidence and
anthropogenic sediment trapping, and a sustainable supply of fluvial sediment is 
therefore critical to prevent deltas being 'drowned' by rising relative sea
levels. Here we combine suspended sediment load data from the Mekong River with
hydrological model simulations to isolate the role of tropical cyclones in
transmitting suspended sediment to one of the world's great deltas. We
demonstrate that spatial variations in the Mekong's suspended sediment load are
correlated (r = 0.765, P < 0.1) with observed variations in tropical-cyclone
climatology, and that a substantial portion (32 per cent) of the suspended
sediment load reaching the delta is delivered by runoff generated by rainfall
associated with tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we estimate that the suspended
load to the delta has declined by 52.6 ± 10.2 megatonnes over recent years
(1981-2005), of which 33.0 ± 7.1 megatonnes is due to a shift in tropical-cyclone
climatology. Consequently, tropical cyclones have a key role in controlling the
magnitude of, and variability in, transmission of suspended sediment to the
coast. It is likely that anthropogenic sediment trapping in upstream reservoirs
is a dominant factor in explaining past, and anticipating future, declines in
suspended sediment loads reaching the world's major deltas. However, our study
shows that changes in tropical-cyclone climatology affect trends in fluvial
suspended sediment loads and thus are also key to fully assessing the risk posed 
to vulnerable coastal systems.

The female germ line undergoes a unique sequence of differentiation processes
that confers totipotency to the egg. The reconstitution of these events in vitro 
using pluripotent stem cells is a key achievement in reproductive biology and
regenerative medicine. Here we report successful reconstitution in vitro of the
entire process of oogenesis from mouse pluripotent stem cells. Fully potent
mature oocytes were generated in culture from embryonic stem cells and from
induced pluripotent stem cells derived from both embryonic fibroblasts and adult 
tail tip fibroblasts. Moreover, pluripotent stem cell lines were re-derived from 
the eggs that were generated in vitro, thereby reconstituting the full female
germline cycle in a dish. This culture system will provide a platform for
elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying totipotency and the production of
oocytes of other mammalian species in culture.

The teeth of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) show rigidly patterned,
unidirectional replacement that may or may not be associated with a shedding
mechanism. These mechanisms, which are critical for the maintenance of the
dentition, are incongruently distributed among extant gnathostomes. Although a
permanent tooth-generating dental lamina is present in all chondrichthyans, many 
tetrapods and some teleosts, it is absent in the non-teleost actinopterygians.
Tooth-shedding by basal hard tissue resorption occurs in most osteichthyans
(including tetrapods) but not in chondrichthyans. Here we report a
three-dimensional virtual dissection of the dentition of a 424-million-year-old
stem osteichthyan, Andreolepis hedei, using propagation phase-contrast
synchrotron microtomography, with a reconstruction of its growth history.
Andreolepis, close to the common ancestor of all extant osteichthyans, shed its
teeth by basal resorption but probably lacked a permanent dental lamina. This is 
the earliest documented instance of resorptive tooth shedding and may represent
the primitive osteichthyan mode of tooth replacement.

Catalytic alkylation of remote C-H bonds enabled by proton-coupled electron
transfer.

Despite advances in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis, there are currently
no molecular HAT catalysts that are capable of homolysing the strong
nitrogen-hydrogen (N-H) bonds of N-alkyl amides. The motivation to develop amide 
homolysis protocols stems from the utility of the resultant amidyl radicals,
which are involved in various synthetically useful transformations, including
olefin amination and directed carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond functionalization. In
the latter process-a subset of the classical Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag
reaction-amidyl radicals remove hydrogen atoms from unactivated aliphatic C-H
bonds. Although powerful, these transformations typically require oxidative
N-prefunctionalization of the amide starting materials to achieve efficient
amidyl generation. Moreover, because these N-activating groups are often
incorporated into the final products, these methods are generally not amenable to
the direct construction of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds. Here we report an approach 
that overcomes these limitations by homolysing the N-H bonds of N-alkyl amides
via proton-coupled electron transfer. In this protocol, an excited-state iridium 
photocatalyst and a weak phosphate base cooperatively serve to remove both a
proton and an electron from an amide substrate in a concerted elementary step.
The resultant amidyl radical intermediates are shown to promote subsequent C-H
abstraction and radical alkylation steps. This C-H alkylation represents a
catalytic variant of the Hofmann-Löffler-Freytag reaction, using simple,
unfunctionalized amides to direct the formation of new C-C bonds. Given the
prevalence of amides in pharmaceuticals and natural products, we anticipate that 
this method will simplify the synthesis and structural elaboration of
amine-containing targets. Moreover, this study demonstrates that concerted
proton-coupled electron transfer can enable homolytic activation of common
organic functional groups that are energetically inaccessible using traditional
HAT-based approaches.

bonds.

Carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation is paramount in the synthesis of biologically 
relevant molecules, modern synthetic materials and commodity chemicals such as
fuels and lubricants. Traditionally, the presence of a functional group is
required at the site of C-C bond formation. Strategies that allow C-C bond
formation at inert carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds enable access to molecules that
would otherwise be inaccessible and the development of more efficient syntheses
of complex molecules. Here we report a method for the formation of C-C bonds by
directed cleavage of traditionally non-reactive C-H bonds and their subsequent
coupling with readily available alkenes. Our methodology allows for
amide-directed selective C-C bond formation at unactivated sp3 C-H bonds in
molecules that contain many such bonds that are seemingly indistinguishable.
Selectivity arises through a relayed photoredox-catalysed oxidation of a
nitrogen-hydrogen bond. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a starting 
point for functionalization at inert C-H bonds through a strategy involving
hydrogen-atom transfer.

The basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei, play a crucial role in
decision-making by selecting actions and evaluating their outcomes. While much is
known about the function of the basal ganglia circuitry in selection, how these
nuclei contribute to outcome evaluation is less clear. Here we show that neurons 
in the habenula-projecting globus pallidus (GPh) in mice are essential for
evaluating action outcomes and are regulated by a specific set of inputs from the
basal ganglia. We find in a classical conditioning task that individual mouse GPh
neurons bidirectionally encode whether an outcome is better or worse than
expected. Mimicking these evaluation signals with optogenetic inhibition or
excitation is sufficient to reinforce or discourage actions in a decision-making 
task. Moreover, cell-type-specific synaptic manipulations reveal that the
inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the GPh are necessary for mice to
appropriately evaluate positive and negative feedback, respectively. Finally,
using rabies-virus-assisted monosynaptic tracing, we show that the GPh is
embedded in a basal ganglia circuit wherein it receives inhibitory input from
both striosomal and matrix compartments of the striatum, and excitatory input
from the 'limbic' regions of the subthalamic nucleus. Our results provide
evidence that information about the selection and evaluation of actions is
channelled through distinct sets of basal ganglia circuits, with the GPh
representing a key locus in which information of opposing valence is integrated
to determine whether action outcomes are better or worse than expected.

Broadening not strengthening of the Agulhas Current since the early 1990s.

Western boundary currents-such as the Agulhas Current in the Indian Ocean-carry
heat poleward, moderating Earth's climate and fuelling the mid-latitude storm
tracks. They could exacerbate or mitigate warming and extreme weather events in
the future, depending on their response to anthropogenic climate change. Climate 
models show an ongoing poleward expansion and intensification of the global wind 
systems, most robustly in the Southern Hemisphere, and linear dynamical theory
suggests that western boundary currents will intensify and shift poleward as a
result. Observational evidence of such changes comes from accelerated warming and
air-sea heat flux rates within all western boundary currents, which are two or
three times faster than global mean rates. Here we show that, despite these
expectations, the Agulhas Current has not intensified since the early 1990s.
Instead, we find that it has broadened as a result of more eddy activity. Recent 
analyses of other western boundary currents-the Kuroshio and East Australia
currents-hint at similar trends. These results indicate that intensifying winds
may be increasing the eddy kinetic energy of boundary currents, rather than their
mean flow. This could act to decrease poleward heat transport and increase
cross-frontal exchange of nutrients and pollutants between the coastal ocean and 
the deep ocean. Sustained in situ measurements are needed to properly understand 
the role of these current systems in a changing climate.

Emergence of a turbulent cascade in a quantum gas.

A central concept in the modern understanding of turbulence is the existence of
cascades of excitations from large to small length scales, or vice versa. This
concept was introduced in 1941 by Kolmogorov and Obukhov, and such cascades have 
since been observed in various systems, including interplanetary plasmas,
supernovae, ocean waves and financial markets. Despite much progress, a
quantitative understanding of turbulence remains a challenge, owing to the
interplay between many length scales that makes theoretical simulations of
realistic experimental conditions difficult. Here we observe the emergence of a
turbulent cascade in a weakly interacting homogeneous Bose gas-a quantum fluid
that can be theoretically described on all relevant length scales. We prepare a
Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical box, drive it out of equilibrium with an
oscillating force that pumps energy into the system at the largest length scale, 
study its nonlinear response to the periodic drive, and observe a gradual
development of a cascade characterized by an isotropic power-law distribution in 
momentum space. We numerically model our experiments using the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation and find excellent agreement with the measurements. Our experiments
establish the uniform Bose gas as a promising new medium for investigating many
aspects of turbulence, including the interplay between vortex and wave
turbulence, and the relative importance of quantum and classical effects.

Unlike the electroweak sector of the standard model of particle physics, quantum 
chromodynamics (QCD) is surprisingly symmetric under time reversal. As there is
no obvious reason for QCD being so symmetric, this phenomenon poses a theoretical
problem, often referred to as the strong CP problem. The most attractive solution
for this requires the existence of a new particle, the axion-a promising
dark-matter candidate. Here we determine the axion mass using lattice QCD,
assuming that these particles are the dominant component of dark matter. The key 
quantities of the calculation are the equation of state of the Universe and the
temperature dependence of the topological susceptibility of QCD, a quantity that 
is notoriously difficult to calculate, especially in the most relevant
high-temperature region (up to several gigaelectronvolts). But by splitting the
vacuum into different sectors and re-defining the fermionic determinants, its
controlled calculation becomes feasible. Thus, our twofold prediction helps most 
cosmological calculations to describe the evolution of the early Universe by
using the equation of state, and may be decisive for guiding experiments looking 
for dark-matter axions. In the next couple of years, it should be possible to
confirm or rule out post-inflation axions experimentally, depending on whether
the axion mass is found to be as predicted here. Alternatively, in a
pre-inflation scenario, our calculation determines the universal axionic angle
that corresponds to the initial condition of our Universe.

The emergence of HIV-1 group M subtype B in North American men who have sex with 
men was a key turning point in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Phylogenetic studies have
suggested cryptic subtype B circulation in the United States (US) throughout the 
1970s and an even older presence in the Caribbean. However, these temporal and
geographical inferences, based upon partial HIV-1 genomes that postdate the
recognition of AIDS in 1981, remain contentious and the earliest movements of the
virus within the US are unknown. We serologically screened >2,000 1970s serum
samples and developed a highly sensitive approach for recovering viral RNA from
degraded archival samples. Here, we report eight coding-complete genomes from US 
serum samples from 1978-1979-eight of the nine oldest HIV-1 group M genomes to
date. This early, full-genome 'snapshot' reveals that the US HIV-1 epidemic
exhibited extensive genetic diversity in the 1970s but also provides strong
evidence for its emergence from a pre-existing Caribbean epidemic. Bayesian
phylogenetic analyses estimate the jump to the US at around 1970 and place the
ancestral US virus in New York City with 0.99 posterior probability support,
strongly suggesting this was the crucial hub of early US HIV/AIDS
diversification. Logistic growth coalescent models reveal epidemic doubling times
of 0.86 and 1.12 years for the US and Caribbean, respectively, suggesting rapid
early expansion in each location. Comparisons with more recent data reveal many
of these insights to be unattainable without archival, full-genome sequences. We 
also recovered the HIV-1 genome from the individual known as 'Patient 0' (ref. 5)
and found neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case
in the US or for subtype B as a whole. We discuss the genesis and persistence of 
this belief in the light of these evolutionary insights.

Pseudogenes are generally considered to be non-functional DNA sequences that
arise through nonsense or frame-shift mutations of protein-coding genes. Although
certain pseudogene-derived RNAs have regulatory roles, and some pseudogene
fragments are translated, no clear functions for pseudogene-derived proteins are 
known. Olfactory receptor families contain many pseudogenes, which reflect low
selection pressures on loci no longer relevant to the fitness of a species. Here 
we report the characterization of a pseudogene in the chemosensory variant
ionotropic glutamate receptor repertoire of Drosophila sechellia, an insect
endemic to the Seychelles that feeds almost exclusively on the ripe fruit of
Morinda citrifolia. This locus, D. sechellia Ir75a, bears a premature termination
codon (PTC) that appears to be fixed in the population. However, D. sechellia
Ir75a encodes a functional receptor, owing to efficient translational
read-through of the PTC. Read-through is detected only in neurons and is
independent of the type of termination codon, but depends on the sequence
downstream of the PTC. Furthermore, although the intact Drosophila melanogaster
Ir75a orthologue detects acetic acid-a chemical cue important for locating
fermenting food found only at trace levels in Morinda fruit-D. sechellia Ir75a
has evolved distinct odour-tuning properties through amino-acid changes in its
ligand-binding domain. We identify functional PTC-containing loci within
different olfactory receptor repertoires and species, suggesting that such
'pseudo-pseudogenes' could represent a widespread phenomenon.

Vacuolar-type ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-powered proton pumps involved in
processes such as endocytosis, lysosomal degradation, secondary transport, TOR
signalling, and osteoclast and kidney function. ATP hydrolysis in the soluble
catalytic V1 region drives proton translocation through the membrane-embedded VO 
region via rotation of a rotor subcomplex. Variability in the structure of the
intact enzyme has prevented construction of an atomic model for the
membrane-embedded motor of any rotary ATPase. We induced dissociation and
auto-inhibition of the V1 and VO regions of the V-ATPase by starving the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, allowing us to obtain a ~3.9-Å resolution electron
cryomicroscopy map of the VO complex and build atomic models for the majority of 
its subunits. The analysis reveals the structures of subunits ac8c'c″de and a
protein that we identify and propose to be a new subunit (subunit f). A large
cavity between subunit a and the c-ring creates a cytoplasmic half-channel for
protons. The c-ring has an asymmetric distribution of proton-carrying Glu
residues, with the Glu residue of subunit c″ interacting with Arg735 of subunit
a. The structure suggests sequential protonation and deprotonation of the c-ring,
with ATP-hydrolysis-driven rotation causing protonation of a Glu residue at the
cytoplasmic half-channel and subsequent deprotonation of a Glu residue at a
luminal half-channel.

Synthetic recoding of genomes, to remove targeted sense codons, may facilitate
the encoded cellular synthesis of unnatural polymers by orthogonal translation
systems. However, our limited understanding of allowed synonymous codon
substitutions, and the absence of methods that enable the stepwise replacement of
the Escherichia coli genome with long synthetic DNA and provide feedback on
allowed and disallowed design features in synthetic genomes, have restricted
progress towards this goal. Here we endow E. coli with a system for efficient,
programmable replacement of genomic DNA with long (>100-kb) synthetic DNA,
through the in vivo excision of double-stranded DNA from an episomal replicon by 
CRISPR/Cas9, coupled to lambda-red-mediated recombination and simultaneous
positive and negative selection. We iterate the approach, providing a basis for
stepwise whole-genome replacement. We attempt systematic recoding in an essential
operon using eight synonymous recoding schemes. Each scheme systematically
replaces target codons with defined synonyms and is compatible with codon
reassignment. Our results define allowed and disallowed synonymous recoding
schemes, and enable the identification and repair of recoding at idiosyncratic
positions in the genome.

Homology-directed DNA repair is essential for genome maintenance through
templated DNA synthesis. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) necessitates 
homology-directed DNA repair to maintain telomeres in about 10-15% of human
cancers. How DNA damage induces assembly and execution of a DNA replication
complex (break-induced replisome) at telomeres or elsewhere in the mammalian
genome is poorly understood. Here we define break-induced telomere synthesis and 
demonstrate that it utilizes a specialized replisome, which underlies ALT
telomere maintenance. DNA double-strand breaks enact nascent telomere synthesis
by long-tract unidirectional replication. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA) loading by replication factor C (RFC) acts as the initial sensor of
telomere damage to establish predominance of DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) through its
POLD3 subunit. Break-induced telomere synthesis requires the RFC-PCNA-Pol δ axis,
but is independent of other canonical replisome components, ATM and ATR, or the
homologous recombination protein Rad51. Thus, the inception of telomere damage
recognition by the break-induced replisome orchestrates homology-directed
telomere maintenance.

Our understanding of the emergence of technology shapes how we view the origins
of humanity. Sharp-edged stone flakes, struck from larger cores, are the primary 
evidence for the earliest stone technology. Here we show that wild bearded
capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) in Brazil deliberately break stones,
unintentionally producing recurrent, conchoidally fractured, sharp-edged flakes
and cores that have the characteristics and morphology of intentionally produced 
hominin tools. The production of archaeologically visible cores and flakes is
therefore no longer unique to the human lineage, providing a comparative
perspective on the emergence of lithic technology. This discovery adds an
additional dimension to interpretations of the human Palaeolithic record, the
possible function of early stone tools, and the cognitive requirements for the
emergence of stone flaking.

Seismic shear wave anisotropy is observed in Earth's uppermost lower mantle
around several subducted slabs. The anisotropy caused by the deformation-induced 
crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of bridgmanite
(perovskite-structured (Mg,Fe)SiO3) is the most plausible explanation for these
seismic observations. However, the rheological properties of bridgmanite are
largely unknown. Uniaxial deformation experiments have been carried out to
determine the deformation texture of bridgmanite, but the dominant slip system
(the slip direction and plane) has not been determined. Here we report the CPO
pattern and dominant slip system of bridgmanite under conditions that correspond 
to the uppermost lower mantle (25 gigapascals and 1,873 kelvin) obtained through 
simple shear deformation experiments using the Kawai-type deformation-DIA
apparatus. The fabrics obtained are characterized by [100] perpendicular to the
shear plane and [001] parallel to the shear direction, implying that the dominant
slip system of bridgmanite is [001](100). The observed seismic shear- wave
anisotropies near several subducted slabs (Tonga-Kermadec, Kurile, Peru and Java)
can be explained in terms of the CPO of bridgmanite as induced by mantle flow
parallel to the direction of subduction.

Protein turnover is a tightly controlled process that is crucial for the removal 
of aberrant polypeptides and for cellular signalling. Whereas ubiquitin marks
eukaryotic proteins for proteasomal degradation, a general tagging system for the
equivalent bacterial Clp proteases is not known. Here we describe the targeting
mechanism of the ClpC-ClpP proteolytic complex from Bacillus subtilis.
Quantitative affinity proteomics using a ClpP-trapping mutant show that proteins 
phosphorylated on arginine residues are selectively targeted to ClpC-ClpP. In
vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrate that arginine phosphorylation by the
McsB kinase is required and sufficient for the degradation of substrate proteins.
The docking site for phosphoarginine is located in the amino-terminal domain of
the ClpC ATPase, as resolved at high resolution in a co-crystal structure.
Together, our data demonstrate that phosphoarginine functions as a bona fide
degradation tag for the ClpC-ClpP protease. This system, which is widely
distributed across Gram-positive bacteria, is functionally analogous to the
eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) functionally resemble T lymphocytes in cytotoxicity 
and cytokine production but lack antigen-specific receptors, and they are
important regulators of immune responses and tissue homeostasis. ILCs are
generated from common lymphoid progenitors, which are subsequently committed to
innate lymphoid lineages in the α-lymphoid progenitor, early innate lymphoid
progenitor, common helper innate lymphoid progenitor and innate lymphoid cell
progenitor compartments. ILCs consist of conventional natural killer cells and
helper-like cells (ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3). Despite recent advances, the cellular
heterogeneity, developmental trajectory and signalling dependence of ILC
progenitors are not fully understood. Here, using single-cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq) of mouse bone marrow progenitors, we reveal ILC precursor subsets,
delineate distinct ILC development stages and pathways, and report that high
expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1hi) marked a committed ILC progenitor that 
was essentially identical to an innate lymphoid cell progenitor. Our data defined
PD-1hiIL-25Rhi as an early checkpoint in ILC2 development, which was abolished by
deficiency in the zinc-finger protein Bcl11b but restored by IL-25R
overexpression. Similar to T lymphocytes, PD-1 was upregulated on activated ILCs.
Administration of a PD-1 antibody depleted PD-1hi ILCs and reduced cytokine
levels in an influenza infection model in mice, and blocked papain-induced acute 
lung inflammation. These results provide a perspective for exploring PD-1 and its
ligand (PD-L1) in immunotherapy, and allow effective manipulation of the immune
system for disease prevention and therapy.

Owing to the limited availability of natural sources, the widespread demand of
the flavouring, perfume and pharmaceutical industries for unsaturated alcohols is
met by producing them from α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, through the selective
hydrogenation of the carbon-oxygen group (in preference to the carbon-carbon
group). However, developing effective catalysts for this transformation is
challenging, because hydrogenation of the carbon-carbon group is
thermodynamically favoured. This difficulty is particularly relevant for one
major category of heterogeneous catalyst: metal nanoparticles supported on metal 
oxides. These systems are generally incapable of significantly enhancing the
selectivity towards thermodynamically unfavoured reactions, because only the
edges of nanoparticles that are in direct contact with the metal-oxide support
possess selective catalytic properties; most of the exposed nanoparticle surfaces
do not. This has inspired the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to
encapsulate metal nanoparticles within their layers or inside their channels, to 
influence the activity of the entire nanoparticle surface while maintaining
efficient reactant and product transport owing to the porous nature of the
material. Here we show that MOFs can also serve as effective selectivity
regulators for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Sandwiching
platinum nanoparticles between an inner core and an outer shell composed of an
MOF with metal nodes of Fe3+, Cr3+ or both (known as MIL-101; refs 19, 20, 21)
results in stable catalysts that convert a range of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes
with high efficiency and with significantly enhanced selectivity towards
unsaturated alcohols. Calculations reveal that preferential interaction of MOF
metal sites with the carbon-oxygen rather than the carbon-carbon group renders
hydrogenation of the former by the embedded platinum nanoparticles a
thermodynamically favoured reaction. We anticipate that our basic design strategy
will allow the development of other selective heterogeneous catalysts for
important yet challenging transformations.

The fin-to-limb transition represents one of the major vertebrate morphological
innovations associated with the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life and
is an attractive model for gaining insights into the mechanisms of morphological 
diversity between species. One of the characteristic features of limbs is the
presence of digits at their extremities. Although most tetrapods have limbs with 
five digits (pentadactyl limbs), palaeontological data indicate that digits
emerged in lobed fins of early tetrapods, which were polydactylous. How the
transition to pentadactyl limbs occurred remains unclear. Here we show that the
mutually exclusive expression of the mouse genes Hoxa11 and Hoxa13, which were
previously proposed to be involved in the origin of the tetrapod limb, is
required for the pentadactyl state. We further demonstrate that the exclusion of 
Hoxa11 from the Hoxa13 domain relies on an enhancer that drives antisense
transcription at the Hoxa11 locus after activation by HOXA13 and HOXD13. Finally,
we show that the enhancer that drives antisense transcription of the mouse Hoxa11
gene is absent in zebrafish, which, together with the largely overlapping
expression of hoxa11 and hoxa13 genes reported in fish, suggests that this
enhancer emerged in the course of the fin-to-limb transition. On the basis of the
polydactyly that we observed after expression of Hoxa11 in distal limbs, we
propose that the evolution of Hoxa11 regulation contributed to the transition
from polydactyl limbs in stem-group tetrapods to pentadactyl limbs in extant
tetrapods.

BinAB is a naturally occurring paracrystalline larvicide distributed worldwide to
combat the devastating diseases borne by mosquitoes. These crystals are composed 
of homologous molecules, BinA and BinB, which play distinct roles in the
multi-step intoxication process, transforming from harmless, robust crystals, to 
soluble protoxin heterodimers, to internalized mature toxin, and finally to toxic
oligomeric pores. The small size of the crystals-50 unit cells per edge, on
average-has impeded structural characterization by conventional means. Here we
report the structure of Lysinibacillus sphaericus BinAB solved de novo by
serial-femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser. The structure
reveals tyrosine- and carboxylate-mediated contacts acting as pH switches to
release soluble protoxin in the alkaline larval midgut. An enormous heterodimeric
interface appears to be responsible for anchoring BinA to receptor-bound BinB for
co-internalization. Remarkably, this interface is largely composed of
propeptides, suggesting that proteolytic maturation would trigger dissociation of
the heterodimer and progression to pore formation.

A unique feature of Pluto's large satellite Charon is its dark red northern polar
cap. Similar colours on Pluto's surface have been attributed to tholin-like
organic macromolecules produced by energetic radiation processing of
hydrocarbons. The polar location on Charon implicates the temperature extremes
that result from Charon's high obliquity and long seasons in the production of
this material. The escape of Pluto's atmosphere provides a potential feedstock
for a complex chemistry. Gas from Pluto that is transiently cold-trapped and
processed at Charon's winter pole was proposed as an explanation for the dark
coloration on the basis of an image of Charon's northern hemisphere, but not
modelled quantitatively. Here we report images of the southern hemisphere
illuminated by Pluto-shine and also images taken during the approach phase that
show the northern polar cap over a range of longitudes. We model the surface
thermal environment on Charon and the supply and temporary cold-trapping of
material escaping from Pluto, as well as the photolytic processing of this
material into more complex and less volatile molecules while cold-trapped. The
model results are consistent with the proposed mechanism for producing the
observed colour pattern on Charon.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by inactivation of the
von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene (VHL). Because no other gene is mutated 
as frequently in ccRCC and VHL mutations are truncal, VHL inactivation is
regarded as the governing event. VHL loss activates the HIF-2 transcription
factor, and constitutive HIF-2 activity restores tumorigenesis in
VHL-reconstituted ccRCC cells. HIF-2 has been implicated in angiogenesis and
multiple other processes, but angiogenesis is the main target of drugs such as
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. HIF-2 has been regarded as undruggable. 
Here we use a tumourgraft/patient-derived xenograft platform to evaluate PT2399, 
a selective HIF-2 antagonist that was identified using a structure-based design
approach. PT2399 dissociated HIF-2 (an obligatory heterodimer of HIF-2α-HIF-1β)
in human ccRCC cells and suppressed tumorigenesis in 56% (10 out of 18) of such
lines. PT2399 had greater activity than sunitinib, was active in
sunitinib-progressing tumours, and was better tolerated. Unexpectedly, some
VHL-mutant ccRCCs were resistant to PT2399. Resistance occurred despite HIF-2
dissociation in tumours and evidence of Hif-2 inhibition in the mouse, as
determined by suppression of circulating erythropoietin, a HIF-2 target and
possible pharmacodynamic marker. We identified a HIF-2-dependent gene signature
in sensitive tumours. Gene expression was largely unaffected by PT2399 in
resistant tumours, illustrating the specificity of the drug. Sensitive tumours
exhibited a distinguishing gene expression signature and generally higher levels 
of HIF-2α. Prolonged PT2399 treatment led to resistance. We identified binding
site and second site suppressor mutations in HIF-2α and HIF-1β, respectively.
Both mutations preserved HIF-2 dimers despite treatment with PT2399. Finally, an 
extensively pretreated patient whose tumour had given rise to a sensitive
tumourgraft showed disease control for more than 11 months when treated with a
close analogue of PT2399, PT2385. We validate HIF-2 as a target in ccRCC, show
that some ccRCCs are HIF-2 independent, and set the stage for biomarker-driven
clinical trials.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma, the most common form of kidney cancer, is
usually linked to inactivation of the pVHL tumour suppressor protein and
consequent accumulation of the HIF-2α transcription factor (also known as EPAS1).
Here we show that a small molecule (PT2399) that directly inhibits HIF-2α causes 
tumour regression in preclinical mouse models of primary and metastatic
pVHL-defective clear cell renal cell carcinoma in an on-target fashion.
pVHL-defective clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines display unexpectedly

Binary and multiple star systems are a frequent outcome of the star formation
process and as a result almost half of all stars with masses similar to that of
the Sun have at least one companion star. Theoretical studies indicate that there
are two main pathways that can operate concurrently to form binary/multiple star 
systems: large-scale fragmentation of turbulent gas cores and filaments or
smaller-scale fragmentation of a massive protostellar disk due to gravitational
instability. Observational evidence for turbulent fragmentation on scales of more
than 1,000 astronomical units has recently emerged. Previous evidence for disk
fragmentation was limited to inferences based on the separations of more-evolved 
pre-main sequence and protostellar multiple systems. The triple protostar system 
L1448 IRS3B is an ideal system with which to search for evidence of disk
fragmentation as it is in an early phase of the star formation process, it is
likely to be less than 150,000 years old and all of the protostars in the system 
are separated by less than 200 astronomical units. Here we report observations of
dust and molecular gas emission that reveal a disk with a spiral structure
surrounding the three protostars. Two protostars near the centre of the disk are 
separated by 61 astronomical units and a tertiary protostar is coincident with a 
spiral arm in the outer disk at a separation of 183 astronomical units. The
inferred mass of the central pair of protostellar objects is approximately one
solar mass, while the disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of
around 0.30 solar masses. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of
about 0.085 solar masses. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B appears
susceptible to disk fragmentation at radii between 150 and 320 astronomical
units, overlapping with the location of the tertiary protostar. This is
consistent with models for a protostellar disk that has recently undergone
gravitational instability, spawning one or two companion stars.

Three-dimensional physical interactions within chromosomes dynamically regulate
gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. However, the 3D organization of
chromosomes during human brain development and its role in regulating gene
networks dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or
schizophrenia, are unknown. Here we generate high-resolution 3D maps of chromatin
contacts during human corticogenesis, permitting large-scale annotation of
previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships relevant to the evolution of 
human cognition and disease. Our analyses identify hundreds of genes that
physically interact with enhancers gained on the human lineage, many of which are
under purifying selection and associated with human cognitive function. We
integrate chromatin contacts with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), highlighting multiple candidate
schizophrenia risk genes and pathways, including transcription factors involved
in neurogenesis, and cholinergic signalling molecules, several of which are
supported by independent expression quantitative trait loci and gene expression
analyses. Genome editing in human neural progenitors suggests that one of these
distal schizophrenia GWAS loci regulates FOXG1 expression, supporting its
potential role as a schizophrenia risk gene. This work provides a framework for
understanding the effect of non-coding regulatory elements on human brain
development and the evolution of cognition, and highlights novel mechanisms
underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.

Mammalian genomes undergo epigenetic modifications, including cytosine
methylation by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Oxidation of 5-methylcytosine by
the Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases can lead to
demethylation. Although cytosine methylation has key roles in several processes
such as genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, the functional
significance of cytosine methylation and demethylation in mouse embryogenesis
remains to be fully determined. Here we show that inactivation of all three Tet
genes in mice leads to gastrulation phenotypes, including primitive streak
patterning defects in association with impaired maturation of axial mesoderm and 
failed specification of paraxial mesoderm, mimicking phenotypes in embryos with
gain-of-function Nodal signalling. Introduction of a single mutant allele of
Nodal in the Tet mutant background partially restored patterning, suggesting that
hyperactive Nodal signalling contributes to the gastrulation failure of Tet
mutants. Increased Nodal signalling is probably due to diminished expression of
the Lefty1 and Lefty2 genes, which encode inhibitors of Nodal signalling.
Moreover, reduction in Lefty gene expression is linked to elevated DNA
methylation, as both Lefty-Nodal signalling and normal morphogenesis are largely 
restored in Tet-deficient embryos when the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b genes are disrupted.
Additionally, a point mutation in Tet that specifically abolishes the dioxygenase
activity causes similar morphological and molecular abnormalities as the null
mutation. Taken together, our results show that TET-mediated oxidation of
5-methylcytosine modulates Lefty-Nodal signalling by promoting demethylation in
opposition to methylation by DNMT3A and DNMT3B. These findings reveal a
fundamental epigenetic mechanism featuring dynamic DNA methylation and
demethylation crucial to regulation of key signalling pathways in early body plan
formation.

The discovery of introns four decades ago was one of the most unexpected findings
in molecular biology. Introns are sequences interrupting genes that must be
removed as part of messenger RNA production. Genome sequencing projects have
shown that most eukaryotic genes contain at least one intron, and frequently
many. Comparison of these genomes reveals a history of long evolutionary periods 
during which few introns were gained, punctuated by episodes of rapid, extensive 
gain. However, although several detailed mechanisms for such episodic intron
generation have been proposed, none has been empirically supported on a genomic
scale. Here we show how short, non-autonomous DNA transposons independently
generated hundreds to thousands of introns in the prasinophyte Micromonas pusilla
and the pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens. Each transposon carries one
splice site. The other splice site is co-opted from the gene sequence that is
duplicated upon transposon insertion, allowing perfect splicing out of the RNA.
The distributions of sequences that can be co-opted are biased with respect to
codons, and phasing of transposon-generated introns is similarly biased. These
transposons insert between pre-existing nucleosomes, so that multiple nearby
insertions generate nucleosome-sized intervening segments. Thus, transposon
insertion and sequence co-option may explain the intron phase biases and
prevalence of nucleosome-sized exons observed in eukaryotes. Overall, the two
independent examples of proliferating elements illustrate a general DNA
transposon mechanism that can plausibly account for episodes of rapid, extensive 
intron gain during eukaryotic evolution.

Avoidance of apoptosis is critical for the development and sustained growth of
tumours. The pro-survival protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is overexpressed
in many cancers, but the development of small molecules targeting this protein
that are amenable for clinical testing has been challenging. Here we describe
S63845, a small molecule that specifically binds with high affinity to the
BH3-binding groove of MCL1. Our mechanistic studies demonstrate that S63845
potently kills MCL1-dependent cancer cells, including multiple myeloma, leukaemia
and lymphoma cells, by activating the BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway. In vivo, S63845 shows potent anti-tumour activity with an acceptable
safety margin as a single agent in several cancers. Moreover, MCL1 inhibition,
either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, proved effective
against several solid cancer-derived cell lines. These results point towards MCL1
as a target for the treatment of a wide range of tumours.

It is widely accepted that complex interactions between cancer cells and their
surrounding microenvironment contribute to disease development, chemo-resistance 
and disease relapse. In light of this observed interdependency, novel therapeutic
interventions that target specific cancer stroma cell lineages and their
interactions are being sought. Here we studied a mouse model of human T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and used intravital microscopy to monitor
the progression of disease within the bone marrow at both the tissue-wide and
single-cell level over time, from bone marrow seeding to development/selection of
chemo-resistance. We observed highly dynamic cellular interactions and
promiscuous distribution of leukaemia cells that migrated across the bone marrow,
without showing any preferential association with bone marrow sub-compartments.
Unexpectedly, this behaviour was maintained throughout disease development, from 
the earliest bone marrow seeding to response and resistance to chemotherapy. Our 
results reveal that T-ALL cells do not depend on specific bone marrow
microenvironments for propagation of disease, nor for the selection of
chemo-resistant clones, suggesting that a stochastic mechanism underlies these
processes. Yet, although T-ALL infiltration and progression are independent of
the stroma, accumulated disease burden leads to rapid, selective remodelling of
the endosteal space, resulting in a complete loss of mature osteoblastic cells
while perivascular cells are maintained. This outcome leads to a shift in the
balance of endogenous bone marrow stroma, towards a composition associated with
less efficient haematopoietic stem cell function. This novel, dynamic analysis of
T-ALL interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment in vivo, supported by
evidence from human T-ALL samples, highlights that future therapeutic
interventions should target the migration and promiscuous interactions of cancer 
cells with the surrounding microenvironment, rather than specific bone marrow
stroma, to combat the invasion by and survival of chemo-resistant T-ALL cells.

As globalization brings people with incompatible attitudes into contact, cultural
conflicts inevitably arise. Little is known about how to mitigate conflict and
about how the conflicts that occur can shape the cultural evolution of the groups
involved. Female genital cutting is a prominent example. Governments and
international agencies have promoted the abandonment of cutting for decades, but 
the practice remains widespread with associated health risks for millions of
girls and women. In their efforts to end cutting, international agents have often
adopted the view that cutting is locally pervasive and entrenched. This implies
the need to introduce values and expectations from outside the local culture.
Members of the target society may view such interventions as unwelcome
intrusions, and campaigns promoting abandonment have sometimes led to backlash as
they struggle to reconcile cultural tolerance with the conviction that cutting
violates universal human rights. Cutting, however, is not necessarily locally
pervasive and entrenched. We designed experiments on cultural change that
exploited the existence of conflicting attitudes within cutting societies. We
produced four entertaining movies that served as experimental treatments in two
experiments in Sudan, and we developed an implicit association test to
unobtrusively measure attitudes about cutting. The movies depart from the view
that cutting is locally pervasive by dramatizing members of an extended family as
they confront each other with divergent views about whether the family should
continue cutting. The movies significantly improved attitudes towards girls who
remain uncut, with one in particular having a relatively persistent effect. These
results show that using entertainment to dramatize locally discordant views can
provide a basis for applied cultural evolution without accentuating intercultural
divisions.

Synthetically engineered genetic circuits can perform a wide variety of tasks but
are generally less accurate than natural systems. Here we revisit the first
synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator, and modify it using principles
from stochastic chemistry in single cells. Specifically, we sought to reduce
error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by
simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly 
regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14
generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds 
of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to
oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them. Our results suggest
that even the simplest synthetic genetic networks can achieve a precision that
rivals natural systems, and emphasize the importance of noise analyses for
circuit design in synthetic biology.

From complex songs to simple honks, birds produce sounds using a unique vocal
organ called the syrinx. Located close to the heart at the tracheobronchial
junction, vocal folds or membranes attached to modified mineralized rings vibrate
to produce sound. Syringeal components were not thought to commonly enter the
fossil record, and the few reported fossilized parts of the syrinx are
geologically young (from the Pleistocene and Holocene (approximately 2.5 million 
years ago to the present)). The only known older syrinx is an Eocene specimen
that was not described or illustrated. Data on the relationship between soft
tissue structures and syringeal three-dimensional geometry are also exceptionally
limited. Here we describe the first remains, to our knowledge, of a fossil syrinx
from the Mesozoic Era, which are preserved in three dimensions in a specimen from
the Late Cretaceous (approximately 66 to 69 million years ago) of Antarctica.
With both cranial and postcranial remains, the new Vegavis iaai specimen is the
most complete to be recovered from a part of the radiation of living birds
(Aves). Enhanced-contrast X-ray computed tomography (CT) of syrinx structure in
twelve extant non-passerine birds, as well as CT imaging of the Vegavis and
Eocene syrinxes, informs both the reconstruction of ancestral states in birds and
properties of the vocal organ in the extinct species. Fused rings in Vegavis form
a well-mineralized pessulus, a derived neognath bird feature, proposed to anchor 
enlarged vocal folds or labia. Left-right bronchial asymmetry, as seen in
Vegavis, is only known in extant birds with two sets of vocal fold sound sources.
The new data show the fossilization potential of the avian vocal organ and beg
the question why these remains have not been found in other dinosaurs. The lack
of other Mesozoic tracheobronchial remains, and the poorly mineralized condition 
in archosaurian taxa without a syrinx, may indicate that a complex syrinx was a
late arising feature in the evolution of birds, well after the origin of flight
and respiratory innovations.

Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence
learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to
represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales,
owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning
model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural
network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to
the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional
computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data
structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When
trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully
answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems
in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest
path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly
generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as
transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a 
DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by 
sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the 
capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural
networks without external read-write memory.

In quantum mechanics, measurements cause wavefunction collapse that yields
precise outcomes, whereas for non-commuting observables such as position and
momentum Heisenberg's uncertainty principle limits the intrinsic precision of a
state. Although theoretical work has demonstrated that it should be possible to
perform simultaneous non-commuting measurements and has revealed the limits on
measurement outcomes, only recently has the dynamics of the quantum state been
discussed. To realize this unexplored regime, we simultaneously apply two
continuous quantum non-demolition probes of non-commuting observables to a
superconducting qubit. We implement multiple readout channels by coupling the
qubit to multiple modes of a cavity. To control the measurement observables, we
implement a 'single quadrature' measurement by driving the qubit and applying
cavity sidebands with a relative phase that sets the observable. Here, we use
this approach to show that the uncertainty principle governs the dynamics of the 
wavefunction by enforcing a lower bound on the measurement-induced disturbance.
Consequently, as we transition from measuring identical to measuring
non-commuting observables, the dynamics make a smooth transition from standard
wavefunction collapse to localized persistent diffusion and then to isotropic
persistent diffusion. Although the evolution of the state differs markedly from
that of a conventional measurement, information about both non-commuting
observables is extracted by keeping track of the time ordering of the measurement
record, enabling quantum state tomography without alternating measurements. Our
work creates novel capabilities for quantum control, including rapid state
purification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state steering and
continuous quantum error correction. As physical systems often interact
continuously with their environment via non-commuting degrees of freedom, our
work offers a way to study how notions of contemporary quantum foundations arise 
in such settings.

Intracellular Ca2+ signalling processes are fundamental to muscle contraction,
neurotransmitter release, cell growth and apoptosis. Release of Ca2+ from the
intracellular stores is supported by a series of ion channels in sarcoplasmic or 
endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER). Among them, two isoforms of the trimeric
intracellular cation (TRIC) channel family, named TRIC-A and TRIC-B, modulate the
release of Ca2+ through the ryanodine receptor or inositol triphosphate receptor,
and maintain the homeostasis of ions within SR/ER lumen. Genetic ablations or
mutations of TRIC channels are associated with hypertension, heart disease,
respiratory defects and brittle bone disease. Despite the pivotal function of
TRIC channels in Ca2+ signalling, their pore architectures and gating mechanisms 
remain unknown. Here we present the structures of TRIC-B1 and TRIC-B2 channels
from Caenorhabditis elegans in complex with endogenous
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2, also known as PIP2) lipid
molecules. The TRIC-B1/B2 proteins and PIP2 assemble into a symmetrical
homotrimeric complex. Each monomer contains an hourglass-shaped hydrophilic pore 
contained within a seven-transmembrane-helix domain. Structural and functional
analyses unravel the central role of PIP2 in stabilizing the cytoplasmic gate of 
the ion permeation pathway and reveal a marked Ca2+-induced conformational change
in a cytoplasmic loop above the gate. A mechanistic model has been proposed to
account for the complex gating mechanism of TRIC channels.

The appearance of people associated with the Lapita culture in the South Pacific 
around 3,000 years ago marked the beginning of the last major human dispersal to 
unpopulated lands. However, the relationship of these pioneers to the
long-established Papuan people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we
present genome-wide ancient DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu (about
3,100-2,700 years before present) and one from Tonga (about 2,700-2,300 years
before present), and analyse them with data from 778 present-day East Asians and 
Oceanians. Today, indigenous people of the South Pacific harbour a mixture of
ancestry from Papuans and a population of East Asian origin that no longer exists
in unmixed form, but is a match to the ancient individuals. Most analyses have
interpreted the minimum of twenty-five per cent Papuan ancestry in the region
today as evidence that the first humans to reach Remote Oceania, including
Polynesia, were derived from population mixtures near New Guinea, before their
further expansion into Remote Oceania. However, our finding that the ancient
individuals had little to no Papuan ancestry implies that later human population 
movements spread Papuan ancestry through the South Pacific after the first
peopling of the islands.

Optical spectroscopy of a primordial isotope has traditionally formed the basis
for understanding the atomic structure of an element. Such studies have been
conducted for most elements and theoretical modelling can be performed to high
precision, taking into account relativistic effects that scale approximately as
the square of the atomic number. However, for the transfermium elements (those
with atomic numbers greater than 100), the atomic structure is experimentally
unknown. These radioactive elements are produced in nuclear fusion reactions at
rates of only a few atoms per second at most and must be studied immediately
following their production, which has so far precluded their optical
spectroscopy. Here we report laser resonance ionization spectroscopy of nobelium 
(No; atomic number 102) in single-atom-at-a-time quantities, in which we identify
the ground-state transition 1S01P1. By combining this result with data from an
observed Rydberg series, we obtain an upper limit for the ionization potential of
nobelium. These accurate results from direct laser excitations of outer-shell
electrons cannot be achieved using state-of-the-art relativistic many-body
calculations that include quantum electrodynamic effects, owing to large
uncertainties in the modelled transition energies of the complex systems under
consideration. Our work opens the door to high-precision measurements of various 
atomic and nuclear properties of elements heavier than nobelium, and motivates
future theoretical work.

Uncertainties in the response of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2
concentrations contribute to the large spread in projections of future climate
change. Climate-carbon cycle models generally agree that elevated atmospheric CO2
concentrations will enhance terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP).
However, the magnitude of this CO2 fertilization effect varies from a 20 per cent
to a 60 per cent increase in GPP for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations
in model studies. Here we demonstrate emergent constraints on large-scale CO2
fertilization using observed changes in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO2
seasonal cycle that are thought to be the result of increasing terrestrial GPP.
Our comparison of atmospheric CO2 measurements from Point Barrow in Alaska and
Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii with historical simulations of the latest climate-carbon 
cycle models demonstrates that the increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal 
cycle at both measurement sites is consistent with increasing annual mean GPP,
driven in part by climate warming, but with differences in CO2 fertilization
controlling the spread among the model trends. As a result, the relationship
between the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle and the magnitude of CO2
fertilization of GPP is almost linear across the entire ensemble of models. When 
combined with the observed trends in the seasonal CO2 amplitude, these
relationships lead to consistent emergent constraints on the CO2 fertilization of
GPP. Overall, we estimate a GPP increase of 37 ± 9 per cent for high-latitude
ecosystems and 32 ± 9 per cent for extratropical ecosystems under a doubling of
atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the basis of the Point Barrow and Cape Kumukahi
records, respectively.

Potassium isotopic evidence for a high-energy giant impact origin of the Moon.

The Earth-Moon system has unique chemical and isotopic signatures compared with
other planetary bodies; any successful model for the origin of this system
therefore has to satisfy these chemical and isotopic constraints. The Moon is
substantially depleted in volatile elements such as potassium compared with the
Earth and the bulk solar composition, and it has long been thought to be the
result of a catastrophic Moon-forming giant impact event.
Volatile-element-depleted bodies such as the Moon were expected to be enriched in
heavy potassium isotopes during the loss of volatiles; however such enrichment
was never found. Here we report new high-precision potassium isotope data for the
Earth, the Moon and chondritic meteorites. We found that the lunar rocks are
significantly (>2σ) enriched in the heavy isotopes of potassium compared to the
Earth and chondrites (by around 0.4 parts per thousand). The enrichment of the
heavy isotope of potassium in lunar rocks compared with those of the Earth and
chondrites can be best explained as the result of the incomplete condensation of 
a bulk silicate Earth vapour at an ambient pressure that is higher than 10 bar.
We used these coupled constraints of the chemical loss and isotopic fractionation
of K to compare two recent dynamic models that were used to explain the identical
non-mass-dependent isotope composition of the Earth and the Moon. Our K isotope
result is inconsistent with the low-energy disk equilibration model, but supports
the high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact model for the origin of the
Moon. High-precision potassium isotope data can also be used as a
'palaeo-barometer' to reveal the physical conditions during the Moon-forming
event.

To explore the origins and consequences of tetraploidy in the African clawed
frog, we sequenced the Xenopus laevis genome and compared it to the related
diploid X. tropicalis genome. We characterize the allotetraploid origin of X.
laevis by partitioning its genome into two homoeologous subgenomes, marked by
distinct families of 'fossil' transposable elements. On the basis of the activity
of these elements and the age of hundreds of unitary pseudogenes, we estimate
that the two diploid progenitor species diverged around 34 million years ago (Ma)
and combined to form an allotetraploid around 17-18 Ma. More than 56% of all
genes were retained in two homoeologous copies. Protein function, gene
expression, and the amount of conserved flanking sequence all correlate with
retention rates. The subgenomes have evolved asymmetrically, with one chromosome 
set more often preserving the ancestral state and the other experiencing more
gene loss, deletion, rearrangement, and reduced gene expression.

The frequency of electric currents associated with charge carriers moving in the 
electronic bands of solids determines the speed limit of electronics and thereby 
that of information and signal processing. The use of light fields to drive
electrons promises access to vastly higher frequencies than conventionally used, 
as electric currents can be induced and manipulated on timescales faster than
that of the quantum dephasing of charge carriers in solids. This forms the basis 
of terahertz (1012 hertz) electronics in artificial superlattices, and has
enabled light-based switches and sampling of currents extending in frequency up
to a few hundred terahertz. Here we demonstrate the extension of electronic
metrology to the multi-petahertz (1015 hertz) frequency range. We use
single-cycle intense optical fields (about one volt per ångström) to drive
electron motion in the bulk of silicon dioxide, and then probe its dynamics by
using attosecond (10-18 seconds) streaking to map the time structure of emerging 
isolated attosecond extreme ultraviolet transients and their optical driver. The 
data establish a firm link between the emission of the extreme ultraviolet
radiation and the light-induced intraband, phase-coherent electric currents that 
extend in frequency up to about eight petahertz, and enable access to the dynamic
nonlinear conductivity of silicon dioxide. Direct probing, confinement and
control of the waveform of intraband currents inside solids on attosecond
timescales establish a method of realizing multi-petahertz coherent electronics. 
We expect this technique to enable new ways of exploring the interplay between
electron dynamics and the structure of condensed matter on the atomic scale.

A flaring X-ray source was found near the galaxy NGC 4697 (ref. 1). Two brief
flares were seen, separated by four years. During each flare, the flux increased 
by a factor of 90 on a timescale of about one minute. There is no associated
optical source at the position of the flares, but if the source was at the
distance of NGC 4697, then the luminosities of the flares were greater than 1039 
erg per second. Here we report the results of a search of archival X-ray data for
70 nearby galaxies looking for similar flares. We found two ultraluminous flaring
sources in globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf companions of parent
elliptical galaxies. One source flared once to a peak luminosity of 9 × 1040 erg 
per second; the other flared five times to 1040 erg per second. The rise times of
all of the flares were less than one minute, and the flares then decayed over
about an hour. When not flaring, the sources appear to be normal accreting
neutron-star or black-hole X-ray binaries, but they are located in old stellar
populations, unlike the magnetars, anomalous X-ray pulsars or soft γ repeaters
that have repetitive flares of similar luminosities.

The post-translational modification of proteins with polyubiquitin regulates
virtually all aspects of cell biology. Eight distinct chain linkage types
co-exist in polyubiquitin and are independently regulated in cells. This
'ubiquitin code' determines the fate of the modified protein. Deubiquitinating
enzymes of the ovarian tumour (OTU) family regulate cellular signalling by
targeting distinct linkage types within polyubiquitin, and understanding their
mechanisms of linkage specificity gives fundamental insights into the ubiquitin
system. Here we reveal how the deubiquitinase Cezanne (also known as OTUD7B)
specifically targets Lys11-linked polyubiquitin. Crystal structures of Cezanne
alone and in complex with monoubiquitin and Lys11-linked diubiquitin, in
combination with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, enable us to
reconstruct the enzymatic cycle in great detail. An intricate mechanism of
ubiquitin-assisted conformational changes activates the enzyme, and while all
chain types interact with the enzymatic S1 site, only Lys11-linked chains can
bind productively across the active site and stimulate catalytic turnover. Our
work highlights the plasticity of deubiquitinases and indicates that new
conformational states can occur when a true substrate, such as diubiquitin, is
bound at the active site.

Macrophages are required for normal embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis and
immunity against microorganisms and tumours. Adult tissue-resident macrophages
largely originate from long-lived, self-renewing embryonic precursors and not
from haematopoietic stem-cell activity in the bone marrow. Although fate-mapping 
studies have uncovered a great amount of detail on the origin and kinetics of
fetal macrophage development in the yolk sac and liver, the molecules that govern
the tissue-specific migration of these cells remain completely unknown. Here we
show that an endothelium-specific molecule, plasmalemma vesicle-associated
protein (PLVAP), regulates the seeding of fetal monocyte-derived macrophages to
tissues in mice. We found that PLVAP-deficient mice have completely normal levels
of both yolk-sac- and bone-marrow-derived macrophages, but that fetal liver
monocyte-derived macrophage populations were practically missing from tissues.
Adult PLVAP-deficient mice show major alterations in macrophage-dependent iron
recycling and mammary branching morphogenesis. PLVAP forms diaphragms in the
fenestrae of liver sinusoidal endothelium during embryogenesis, interacts with
chemoattractants and adhesion molecules and regulates the egress of fetal liver
monocytes to the systemic vasculature. Thus, PLVAP selectively controls the exit 
of macrophage precursors from the fetal liver and, to our knowledge, is the first
molecule identified in any organ as regulating the migratory events during
embryonic macrophage ontogeny.

Pancreatic cancer, a highly aggressive tumour type with uniformly poor prognosis,
exemplifies the classically held view of stepwise cancer development. The current
model of tumorigenesis, based on analyses of precursor lesions, termed pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasm (PanINs) lesions, makes two predictions: first, that
pancreatic cancer develops through a particular sequence of genetic alterations
(KRAS, followed by CDKN2A, then TP53 and SMAD4); and second, that the
evolutionary trajectory of pancreatic cancer progression is gradual because each 
alteration is acquired independently. A shortcoming of this model is that
clonally expanded precursor lesions do not always belong to the tumour lineage,
indicating that the evolutionary trajectory of the tumour lineage and precursor
lesions can be divergent. This prevailing model of tumorigenesis has contributed 
to the clinical notion that pancreatic cancer evolves slowly and presents at a
late stage. However, the propensity for this disease to rapidly metastasize and
the inability to improve patient outcomes, despite efforts aimed at early
detection, suggest that pancreatic cancer progression is not gradual. Here, using
newly developed informatics tools, we tracked changes in DNA copy number and
their associated rearrangements in tumour-enriched genomes and found that
pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis is neither gradual nor follows the accepted
mutation order. Two-thirds of tumours harbour complex rearrangement patterns
associated with mitotic errors, consistent with punctuated equilibrium as the
principal evolutionary trajectory. In a subset of cases, the consequence of such 
errors is the simultaneous, rather than sequential, knockout of canonical
preneoplastic genetic drivers that are likely to set-off invasive cancer growth. 
These findings challenge the current progression model of pancreatic cancer and
provide insights into the mutational processes that give rise to these aggressive
tumours.

The mammalian visual cortex massively innervates the brainstem, a
phylogenetically older structure, via cortico-fugal axonal projections. Many
cortico-fugal projections target brainstem nuclei that mediate innate motor
behaviours, but the function of these projections remains poorly understood. A
prime example of such behaviours is the optokinetic reflex (OKR), an innate eye
movement mediated by the brainstem accessory optic system, that stabilizes images
on the retina as the animal moves through the environment and is thus crucial for
vision. The OKR is plastic, allowing the amplitude of this reflex to be
adaptively adjusted relative to other oculomotor reflexes and thereby ensuring
image stability throughout life. Although the plasticity of the OKR is thought to
involve subcortical structures such as the cerebellum and vestibular nuclei,
cortical lesions have suggested that the visual cortex might also be involved.
Here we show that projections from the mouse visual cortex to the accessory optic
system promote the adaptive plasticity of the OKR. OKR potentiation, a
compensatory plastic increase in the amplitude of the OKR in response to
vestibular impairment, is diminished by silencing visual cortex. Furthermore,
targeted ablation of a sparse population of cortico-fugal neurons that
specifically project to the accessory optic system severely impairs OKR
potentiation. Finally, OKR potentiation results from an enhanced drive exerted by
the visual cortex onto the accessory optic system. Thus, cortico-fugal
projections to the brainstem enable the visual cortex, an area that has been
principally studied for its sensory processing function, to plastically adapt the
execution of innate motor behaviours.

Ocean earthquake.

Water, the most abundant volatile in Earth's interior, preserves the young
surface of our planet by catalysing mantle convection, lubricating plate
tectonics and feeding arc volcanism. Since planetary accretion, water has been
exchanged between the hydrosphere and the geosphere, but its depth distribution
in the mantle remains elusive. Water drastically reduces the strength of olivine 
and this effect can be exploited to estimate the water content of olivine from
the mechanical response of the asthenosphere to stress perturbations such as the 
ones following large earthquakes. Here, we exploit the sensitivity to water of
the strength of olivine, the weakest and most abundant mineral in the upper
mantle, and observations of the exceptionally large (moment magnitude 8.6) 2012
Indian Ocean earthquake to constrain the stratification of water content in the
upper mantle. Taking into account a wide range of temperature conditions and the 
transient creep of olivine, we explain the transient deformation in the aftermath
of the earthquake that was recorded by continuous geodetic stations along Sumatra
as the result of water- and stress-activated creep of olivine. This implies a
minimum water content of about 0.01 per cent by weight-or 1,600 H atoms per
million Si atoms-in the asthenosphere (the part of the upper mantle below the
lithosphere). The earthquake ruptured conjugate faults down to great depths,
compatible with dry olivine in the oceanic lithosphere. We attribute the steep
rheological contrast to dehydration across the lithosphere-asthenosphere
boundary, presumably by buoyant melt migration to form the oceanic crust.

The concept of a weak asthenospheric layer underlying Earth's mobile tectonic
plates is fundamental to our understanding of mantle convection and plate
tectonics. However, little is known about the mechanical properties of the
asthenosphere (the part of the upper mantle below the lithosphere) underlying the
oceanic crust, which covers about 60 per cent of Earth's surface. Great
earthquakes cause large coseismic crustal deformation in areas hundreds of
kilometres away from and below the rupture area. Subsequent relaxation of the
earthquake-induced stresses in the viscoelastic upper mantle leads to prolonged
postseismic crustal deformation that may last several decades and can be recorded
with geodetic methods. The observed postseismic deformation helps us to
understand the rheological properties of the upper mantle, but so far such
measurements have been limited to continental-plate boundary zones. Here we
consider the postseismic deformation of the very large (moment magnitude 8.6)
2012 Indian Ocean earthquake to provide by far the most direct constraint on the 
structure of oceanic mantle rheology. In the first three years after the Indian
Ocean earthquake, 37 continuous Global Navigation Satellite Systems stations in
the region underwent horizontal northeastward displacements of up to 17
centimetres in a direction similar to that of the coseismic offsets. However, a
few stations close to the rupture area that had experienced subsidence of up to
about 4 centimetres during the earthquake rose by nearly 7 centimetres after the 
earthquake. Our three-dimensional viscoelastic finite-element models of the
post-earthquake deformation show that a thin (30-200 kilometres), low-viscosity
(having a steady-state Maxwell viscosity of (0.5-10) × 1018 pascal seconds)
asthenospheric layer beneath the elastic oceanic lithosphere is required to
produce the observed postseismic uplift.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) constitute a potential source of
autologous patient-specific cardiomyocytes for cardiac repair, providing a major 
benefit over other sources of cells in terms of immune rejection. However,
autologous transplantation has substantial challenges related to manufacturing
and regulation. Although major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched
allogeneic transplantation is a promising alternative strategy, few immunological
studies have been carried out with iPSCs. Here we describe an allogeneic
transplantation model established using the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca
fascicularis), the MHC structure of which is identical to that of humans.
Fibroblast-derived iPSCs were generated from a MHC haplotype (HT4) homozygous
animal and subsequently differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Five HT4
heterozygous monkeys were subjected to myocardial infarction followed by direct
intra-myocardial injection of iPSC-CMs. The grafted cardiomyocytes survived for
12 weeks with no evidence of immune rejection in monkeys treated with clinically 
relevant doses of methylprednisolone and tacrolimus, and showed electrical
coupling with host cardiomyocytes as assessed by use of the fluorescent calcium
indicator G-CaMP7.09. Additionally, transplantation of the iPSC-CMs improved
cardiac contractile function at 4 and 12 weeks after transplantation; however,
the incidence of ventricular tachycardia was transiently, but significantly,
increased when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Collectively, our data
demonstrate that allogeneic iPSC-CM transplantation is sufficient to regenerate
the infarcted non-human primate heart; however, further research to control
post-transplant arrhythmias is necessary.

Transient, multi-protein complexes are important facilitators of cellular
functions. This includes the chaperome, an abundant protein family comprising
chaperones, co-chaperones, adaptors, and folding enzymes-dynamic complexes of
which regulate cellular homeostasis together with the protein degradation
machinery. Numerous studies have addressed the role of chaperome members in
isolation, yet little is known about their relationships regarding how they
interact and function together in malignancy. As function is probably highly
dependent on endogenous conditions found in native tumours, chaperomes have
resisted investigation, mainly due to the limitations of methods needed to
disrupt or engineer the cellular environment to facilitate analysis. Such
limitations have led to a bottleneck in our understanding of chaperome-related
disease biology and in the development of chaperome-targeted cancer treatment.
Here we examined the chaperome complexes in a large set of tumour specimens. The 
methods used maintained the endogenous native state of tumours and we exploited
this to investigate the molecular characteristics and composition of the
chaperome in cancer, the molecular factors that drive chaperome networks to
crosstalk in tumours, the distinguishing factors of the chaperome in tumours
sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition, and the characteristics of tumours that
may benefit from chaperome therapy. We find that under conditions of stress, such
as malignant transformation fuelled by MYC, the chaperome becomes biochemically
'rewired' to form a network of stable, survival-facilitating,
high-molecular-weight complexes. The chaperones heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and
heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) are nucleating sites for these physically
and functionally integrated complexes. The results indicate that these tightly
integrated chaperome units, here termed the epichaperome, can function as a
network to enhance cellular survival, irrespective of tissue of origin or genetic
background. The epichaperome, present in over half of all cancers tested, has
implications for diagnostics and also provides potential vulnerability as a
target for drug intervention.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast
chemical neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and have diverse
signalling roles in the central nervous system. The nicotinic receptor has been a
model system for cell-surface receptors, and specifically for ligand-gated ion
channels, for well over a century. In addition to the receptors' prominent roles 
in the development of the fields of pharmacology and neurobiology, nicotinic
receptors are important therapeutic targets for neuromuscular disease, addiction,
epilepsy and for neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery. The overall
architecture of the receptor was described in landmark studies of the nicotinic
receptor isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. Structures of a
soluble ligand-binding domain have provided atomic-scale insights into
receptor-ligand interactions, while high-resolution structures of other members
of the pentameric receptor superfamily provide touchstones for an emerging
allosteric gating mechanism. All available high-resolution structures are of
homopentameric receptors. However, the vast majority of pentameric receptors
(called Cys-loop receptors in eukaryotes) present physiologically are
heteromeric. Here we present the X-ray crystallographic structure of the human
α4β2 nicotinic receptor, the most abundant nicotinic subtype in the brain. This
structure provides insights into the architectural principles governing ligand
recognition, heteromer assembly, ion permeation and desensitization in this
prototypical receptor class.

Given its central role in photosynthesis and artificial energy-harvesting
devices, energy transfer has been widely studied using optical spectroscopy to
monitor excitation dynamics and probe the molecular-level control of energy
transfer between coupled molecules. However, the spatial resolution of
conventional optical spectroscopy is limited to a few hundred nanometres and thus
cannot reveal the nanoscale spatial features associated with such processes. In
contrast, scanning tunnelling luminescence spectroscopy has revealed the energy
dynamics associated with phenomena ranging from single-molecule
electroluminescence, absorption of localized plasmons and quantum interference
effects to energy delocalization and intervalley electron scattering with
submolecular spatial resolution in real space. Here we apply this technique to
individual molecular dimers that comprise a magnesium phthalocyanine and a
free-base phthalocyanine (MgPc and H2Pc) and find that locally exciting MgPc with
the tunnelling current of the scanning tunnelling microscope generates a
luminescence signal from a nearby H2Pc molecule as a result of resonance energy
transfer from the former to the latter. A reciprocating resonance energy transfer
is observed when exciting the second singlet state (S2) of H2Pc, which results in
energy transfer to the first singlet state (S1) of MgPc and final funnelling to
the S1 state of H2Pc. We also show that tautomerization of H2Pc changes the
energy transfer characteristics within the dimer system, which essentially makes 
H2Pc a single-molecule energy transfer valve device that manifests itself by
blinking resonance energy transfer behaviour.

Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is a critical virulence factor that causes
diseases associated with C. difficile infection. Here we carried out
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-wide screens and identified the members of the Wnt
receptor frizzled family (FZDs) as TcdB receptors. TcdB binds to the conserved
Wnt-binding site known as the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), with the highest
affinity towards FZD1, 2 and 7. TcdB competes with Wnt for binding to FZDs, and
its binding blocks Wnt signalling. FZD1/2/7 triple-knockout cells are highly
resistant to TcdB, and recombinant FZD2-CRD prevented TcdB binding to the colonic
epithelium. Colonic organoids cultured from FZD7-knockout mice, combined with
knockdown of FZD1 and 2, showed increased resistance to TcdB. The colonic
epithelium in FZD7-knockout mice was less susceptible to TcdB-induced tissue
damage in vivo. These findings establish FZDs as physiologically relevant
receptors for TcdB in the colonic epithelium.

Naturally occurring, pharmacologically active peptides constrained with covalent 
crosslinks generally have shapes that have evolved to fit precisely into binding 
pockets on their targets. Such peptides can have excellent pharmaceutical
properties, combining the stability and tissue penetration of small-molecule
drugs with the specificity of much larger protein therapeutics. The ability to
design constrained peptides with precisely specified tertiary structures would
enable the design of shape-complementary inhibitors of arbitrary targets. Here we
describe the development of computational methods for accurate de novo design of 
conformationally restricted peptides, and the use of these methods to design
18-47 residue, disulfide-crosslinked peptides, a subset of which are heterochiral
and/or N-C backbone-cyclized. Both genetically encodable and non-canonical
peptides are exceptionally stable to thermal and chemical denaturation, and 12
experimentally determined X-ray and NMR structures are nearly identical to the
computational design models. The computational design methods and stable
scaffolds presented here provide the basis for development of a new generation of
peptide-based drugs.

Antimalarial drugs have thus far been chiefly derived from two sources-natural
products and synthetic drug-like compounds. Here we investigate whether
antimalarial agents with novel mechanisms of action could be discovered using a
diverse collection of synthetic compounds that have three-dimensional features
reminiscent of natural products and are underrepresented in typical screening
collections. We report the identification of such compounds with both previously 
reported and undescribed mechanisms of action, including a series of bicyclic
azetidines that inhibit a new antimalarial target, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. 
These molecules are curative in mice at a single, low dose and show activity
against all parasite life stages in multiple in vivo efficacy models. Our
findings identify bicyclic azetidines with the potential to both cure and prevent
transmission of the disease as well as protect at-risk populations with a single 
oral dose, highlighting the strength of diversity-oriented synthesis in revealing
promising therapeutic targets.

Mitochondrial complex I (also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase)
contributes to cellular energy production by transferring electrons from NADH to 
ubiquinone coupled to proton translocation across the membrane. It is the largest
protein assembly of the respiratory chain with a total mass of 970 kilodaltons.
Here we present a nearly complete atomic structure of ovine (Ovis aries)
mitochondrial complex I at 3.9 Å resolution, solved by cryo-electron microscopy
with cross-linking and mass-spectrometry mapping experiments. All 14 conserved
core subunits and 31 mitochondria-specific supernumerary subunits are resolved
within the L-shaped molecule. The hydrophilic matrix arm comprises flavin
mononucleotide and 8 iron-sulfur clusters involved in electron transfer, and the 
membrane arm contains 78 transmembrane helices, mostly contributed by
antiporter-like subunits involved in proton translocation. Supernumerary subunits
form an interlinked, stabilizing shell around the conserved core. Tightly bound
lipids (including cardiolipins) further stabilize interactions between the
hydrophobic subunits. Subunits with possible regulatory roles contain additional 
cofactors, NADPH and two phosphopantetheine molecules, which are shown to be
involved in inter-subunit interactions. We observe two different conformations of
the complex, which may be related to the conformationally driven coupling
mechanism and to the active-deactive transition of the enzyme. Our structure
provides insight into the mechanism, assembly, maturation and dysfunction of
mitochondrial complex I, and allows detailed molecular analysis of
disease-causing mutations.

Intracellular delivery of materials has become a critical component of
genome-editing approaches, ex vivo cell-based therapies, and a diversity of
fundamental research applications. Limitations of current technologies motivate
development of next-generation systems that can deliver a broad variety of cargo 
to diverse cell types. Here we review in vitro and ex vivo intracellular delivery
approaches with a focus on mechanisms, challenges and opportunities. In
particular, we emphasize membrane-disruption-based delivery methods and the
transformative role of nanotechnology, microfluidics and laboratory-on-chip
technology in advancing the field.

Random bombardment by comets, asteroids and associated fragments form and alter
the lunar regolith and other rocky surfaces. The accumulation of impact craters
over time is of fundamental use in evaluating the relative ages of geologic
units. Crater counts and radiometric ages from returned samples provide
constraints with which to derive absolute model ages for unsampled units on the
Moon and other Solar System objects. However, although studies of existing
craters and returned samples offer insight into the process of crater formation
and the past cratering rate, questions still remain about the present rate of
crater production, the effect of early-stage jetting during impacts and the
influence that distal ejecta have on the regolith. Here we use Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) temporal ('before 
and after') image pairs to quantify the contemporary rate of crater production on
the Moon, to reveal previously unknown details of impact-induced jetting, and to 
identify a secondary impact process that is rapidly churning the regolith. From
this temporal dataset, we detected 222 new impact craters and found 33 per cent
more craters (with diameters of at least ten metres) than predicted by the
standard Neukum production and chronology functions for the Moon. We identified
broad reflectance zones associated with the new craters that we interpret as
evidence of a surface-bound jetting process. We also observe a secondary
cratering process that we estimate churns the top two centimetres of regolith on 
a timescale of 81,000 years-more than a hundred times faster than previous models
estimated from meteoritic impacts (ten million years).

The 2013-2016 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in West Africa was of unprecedented
magnitude and changed our perspective on this lethal but sporadically emerging
virus. This outbreak also marked the beginning of large-scale real-time molecular
epidemiology. Here, we show how evolutionary analyses of Ebola virus genome
sequences provided key insights into virus origins, evolution and spread during
the epidemic. We provide basic scientists, epidemiologists, medical practitioners
and other outbreak responders with an enhanced understanding of the utility and
limitations of pathogen genomic sequencing. This will be crucially important in
our attempts to track and control future infectious disease outbreaks.

The surfaces of Earth and Mars contain large bedrock canyons that were carved by 
catastrophic outburst floods. Reconstructing the magnitude of these
canyon-forming floods is essential for understanding the ways in which floods
modify planetary surfaces, the hydrology of early Mars and abrupt changes in
climate. Flood discharges are often estimated by assuming that the floods filled 
the canyons to their brims with water; however, an alternative hypothesis is that
canyon morphology adjusts during incision such that bed shear stresses exceed the
threshold for erosion by a small amount. Here we show that accounting for erosion
thresholds during canyon incision results in near-constant discharges that are
five- to ten-fold smaller than full-to-the-brim estimates for Moses Coulee, a
canyon in the Channeled Scablands, which was carved during the Pleistocene by the
catastrophic Missoula floods in eastern Washington, USA. The predicted discharges
are consistent with flow-depth indicators from gravel bars within the canyon. In 
contrast, under the assumption that floods filled canyons to their brims, a large
and monotonic increase in flood discharge is predicted as the canyon was
progressively incised, which is at odds with the discharges expected for floods
originating from glacial lake outbursts. These findings suggest that flood-carved
landscapes in fractured rock might evolve to a threshold state for bedrock
erosion, thus implying much lower flood discharges than previously thought.

Chromosome conformation capture methods have identified subchromosomal structures
of higher-order chromatin interactions called topologically associated domains
(TADs) that are separated from each other by boundary regions. By subdividing the
genome into discrete regulatory units, TADs restrict the contacts that enhancers 
establish with their target genes. However, the mechanisms that underlie
partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. Here we show by
chromosome conformation capture (capture Hi-C and 4C-seq methods) that genomic
duplications in patient cells and genetically modified mice can result in the
formation of new chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines
their molecular pathology. Duplications of non-coding DNA within the mouse Sox9
TAD (intra-TAD) that cause female to male sex reversal in humans, showed
increased contact of the duplicated regions within the TAD, but no change in the 
overall TAD structure. In contrast, overlapping duplications that extended over
the next boundary into the neighbouring TAD (inter-TAD), resulted in the
formation of a new chromatin domain (neo-TAD) that was isolated from the rest of 
the genome. As a consequence of this insulation, inter-TAD duplications had no
phenotypic effect. However, incorporation of the next flanking gene, Kcnj2, in
the neo-TAD resulted in ectopic contacts of Kcnj2 with the duplicated part of the
Sox9 regulatory region, consecutive misexpression of Kcnj2, and a limb
malformation phenotype. Our findings provide evidence that TADs are genomic
regulatory units with a high degree of internal stability that can be sculptured 
by structural genomic variations. This process is important for the
interpretation of copy number variations, as these variations are routinely
detected in diagnostic tests for genetic disease and cancer. This finding also
has relevance in an evolutionary setting because copy-number differences are
thought to have a crucial role in the evolution of genome complexity.

Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly
since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing
reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may 
gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in
various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or
pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity
may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by
analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age
tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the world's oldest
person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the
maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints.

Advances in genome assembly and phasing provide an opportunity to investigate the
diploid architecture of the human genome and reveal the full range of structural 
variation across population groups. Here we report the de novo assembly and
haplotype phasing of the Korean individual AK1 (ref. 1) using single-molecule
real-time sequencing, next-generation mapping, microfluidics-based linked reads, 
and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing approaches. Single-molecule 
sequencing coupled with next-generation mapping generated a highly contiguous
assembly, with a contig N50 size of 17.9 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 44.8 Mb,
resolving 8 chromosomal arms into single scaffolds. The de novo assembly, along
with local assemblies and spanning long reads, closes 105 and extends into 72 out
of 190 euchromatic gaps in the reference genome, adding 1.03 Mb of previously
intractable sequence. High concordance between the assembly and paired-end
sequences from 62,758 BAC clones provides strong support for the robustness of
the assembly. We identify 18,210 structural variants by direct comparison of the 
assembly with the human reference, identifying thousands of breakpoints that, to 
our knowledge, have not been reported before. Many of the insertions are
reflected in the transcriptome and are shared across the Asian population. We
performed haplotype phasing of the assembly with short reads, long reads and
linked reads from whole-genome sequencing and with short reads from 31,719 BAC
clones, thereby achieving phased blocks with an N50 size of 11.6 Mb. Haplotigs
assembled from single-molecule real-time reads assigned to haplotypes on phased
blocks covered 89% of genes. The haplotigs accurately characterized the
hypervariable major histocompatability complex region as well as demonstrating
allele configuration in clinically relevant genes such as CYP2D6. This work
presents the most contiguous diploid human genome assembly so far, with extensive
investigation of unreported and Asian-specific structural variants, and
high-quality haplotyping of clinically relevant alleles for precision medicine.

Atypical food intake is a primary cause of obesity and other eating and metabolic
disorders. Insight into the neural control of feeding has previously focused
mainly on signalling mechanisms associated with the hypothalamus, the major
centre in the brain that regulates body weight homeostasis. However, roles of
non-canonical central nervous system signalling mechanisms in regulating feeding 
behaviour have been largely uncharacterized. Acetylcholine has long been proposed
to influence feeding owing in part to the functional similarity between
acetylcholine and nicotine, a known appetite suppressant. Nicotine is an
exogenous agonist for acetylcholine receptors, suggesting that endogenous
cholinergic signalling may play a part in normal physiological regulation of
feeding. However, it remains unclear how cholinergic neurons in the brain
regulate food intake. Here we report that cholinergic neurons of the mouse basal 
forebrain potently influence food intake and body weight. Impairment of
cholinergic signalling increases food intake and results in severe obesity,
whereas enhanced cholinergic signalling decreases food consumption. We found that
cholinergic circuits modulate appetite suppression on downstream targets in the
hypothalamus. Together our data reveal the cholinergic basal forebrain as a major
modulatory centre underlying feeding behaviour.

The gradual accumulation of genetic mutations in human adult stem cells (ASCs)
during life is associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer.
Extreme variation in cancer risk across tissues was recently proposed to depend
on the lifetime number of ASC divisions, owing to unavoidable random mutations
that arise during DNA replication. However, the rates and patterns of mutations
in normal ASCs remain unknown. Here we determine genome-wide mutation patterns in
ASCs of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging
from 3 to 87 years by sequencing clonal organoid cultures derived from primary
multipotent cells. Our results show that mutations accumulate steadily over time 
in all of the assessed tissue types, at a rate of approximately 40 novel
mutations per year, despite the large variation in cancer incidence among these
tissues. Liver ASCs, however, have different mutation spectra compared to those
of the colon and small intestine. Mutational signature analysis reveals that this
difference can be attributed to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine
residues in the colon and small intestine, probably reflecting their high ASC
division rate. In liver, a signature with an as-yet-unknown underlying mechanism 
is predominant. Mutation spectra of driver genes in cancer show high similarity
to the tissue-specific ASC mutation spectra, suggesting that intrinsic mutational
processes in ASCs can initiate tumorigenesis. Notably, the inter-individual
variation in mutation rate and spectra are low, suggesting tissue-specific
activity of common mutational processes throughout life.

The psychological, sociological and evolutionary roots of conspecific violence in
humans are still debated, despite attracting the attention of intellectuals for
over two millennia. Here we propose a conceptual approach towards understanding
these roots based on the assumption that aggression in mammals, including humans,
has a significant phylogenetic component. By compiling sources of mortality from 
a comprehensive sample of mammals, we assessed the percentage of deaths due to
conspecifics and, using phylogenetic comparative tools, predicted this value for 
humans. The proportion of human deaths phylogenetically predicted to be caused by
interpersonal violence stood at 2%. This value was similar to the one
phylogenetically inferred for the evolutionary ancestor of primates and apes,
indicating that a certain level of lethal violence arises owing to our position
within the phylogeny of mammals. It was also similar to the percentage seen in
prehistoric bands and tribes, indicating that we were as lethally violent then as
common mammalian evolutionary history would predict. However, the level of lethal
violence has changed through human history and can be associated with changes in 
the socio-political organization of human populations. Our study provides a
detailed phylogenetic and historical context against which to compare levels of
lethal violence observed throughout our history.

Birth weight (BW) has been shown to be influenced by both fetal and maternal
factors and in observational studies is reproducibly associated with future risk 
of adult metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular
disease. These life-course associations have often been attributed to the impact 
of an adverse early life environment. Here, we performed a multi-ancestry
genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of BW in 153,781 individuals, 
identifying 60 loci where fetal genotype was associated with BW (P < 5 × 10-8).
Overall, approximately 15% of variance in BW was captured by assays of fetal
genetic variation. Using genetic association alone, we found strong inverse
genetic correlations between BW and systolic blood pressure (Rg = -0.22,
P = 5.5 × 10-13), T2D (Rg = -0.27, P = 1.1 × 10-6) and coronary artery disease
(Rg = -0.30, P = 6.5 × 10-9). In addition, using large -cohort datasets, we
demonstrated that genetic factors were the major contributor to the negative
covariance between BW and future cardiometabolic risk. Pathway analyses indicated
that the protein products of genes within BW-associated regions were enriched for
diverse processes including insulin signalling, glucose homeostasis, glycogen
biosynthesis and chromatin remodelling. There was also enrichment of associations
with BW in known imprinted regions (P = 1.9 × 10-4). We demonstrate that
life-course associations between early growth phenotypes and adult
cardiometabolic disease are in part the result of shared genetic effects and
identify some of the pathways through which these causal genetic effects are
mediated.

Bacterial adaptive immune systems use CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for RNA-guided
nucleic acid cleavage. Although most prokaryotic adaptive immune systems
generally target DNA substrates, type III and VI CRISPR systems direct
interference complexes against single-stranded RNA substrates. In type VI
systems, the single-subunit C2c2 protein functions as an RNA-guided RNA
endonuclease (RNase). How this enzyme acquires mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that
are essential for immune surveillance and how it carries out crRNA-mediated RNA
cleavage remain unclear. Here we show that bacterial C2c2 possesses a unique
RNase activity responsible for CRISPR RNA maturation that is distinct from its
RNA-activated single-stranded RNA degradation activity. These dual RNase
functions are chemically and mechanistically different from each other and from
the crRNA-processing behaviour of the evolutionarily unrelated CRISPR enzyme Cpf1
(ref. 11). The two RNase activities of C2c2 enable multiplexed processing and
loading of guide RNAs that in turn allow sensitive detection of cellular
transcripts.

Evolution of global temperature over the past two million years.

Stanford, California 94305, USA.

Reconstructions of Earth's past climate strongly influence our understanding of
the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet global temperature has
been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of time, and continuous
reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially 
weighted proxy reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2 million years
estimated from a multi-proxy database of over 20,000 sea surface temperature
point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled until roughly 1.2
million years ago and cooling then stalled until the present. The cooling trend
probably stalled before the beginning of the mid-Pleistocene transition, and
pre-dated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around 0.9 million years
ago. Thus, global cooling may have been a pre-condition for, but probably is not 
the sole causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi-100,000-year glacial cycles at
the mid-Pleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000 years, polar amplification 
(the amplification of temperature change at the poles relative to global
temperature change) has been stable over time, and global temperature and
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been closely coupled across
glacial cycles. A comparison of the new temperature reconstruction with radiative
forcing from greenhouse gases estimates an Earth system sensitivity of 9 degrees 
Celsius (range 7 to 13 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) change in 
global average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide
over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at today's
greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of 5 
degrees Celsius (range 3 to 7 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval)
over the next few millennia as ice sheets, vegetation and atmospheric dust
continue to respond to global warming.

Flexoelectricity is a property of all dielectric materials whereby they polarize 
in response to deformation gradients such as those produced by bending. Although 
it is generally thought of as a property of dielectric insulators, insulation is 
not a formal requirement: in principle, semiconductors can also redistribute
their free charge in response to strain gradients. Here we show that bending a
semiconductor not only generates a flexoelectric-like response, but that this
response can in fact be much larger than in insulators. By doping single crystals
of wide-bandgap oxides to increase their conductivity, their effective
flexoelectric coefficient was increased by orders of magnitude. This large
response can be explained by a barrier-layer mechanism that remains important
even at the macroscale, where conventional (insulator) flexoelectricity otherwise
tends to be small. Our results open up the possibility of using semiconductors as
active ingredients in electromechanical transducer applications.

The population history of Aboriginal Australians remains largely uncharacterized.
Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of
Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find
that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years 
ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent 
of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied
Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that
differentiated ~10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia
during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow
from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the
Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans
diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal,
and subsequently admixed with archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of
selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the
desert.

Here we report the Simons Genome Diversity Project data set: high quality genomes
from 300 individuals from 142 diverse populations. These genomes include at least
5.8 million base pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our
analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome variation,
including that the rate of accumulation of mutations has accelerated by about 5% 
in non-Africans compared to Africans since divergence. We show that the ancestors
of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by
100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural
modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and
Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern
humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the
same source as that of other non-Africans.

High-coverage whole-genome sequence studies have so far focused on a limited
number of geographically restricted populations, or been targeted at specific
diseases, such as cancer. Nevertheless, the availability of high-resolution
genomic data has led to the development of new methodologies for inferring
population history and refuelled the debate on the mutation rate in humans. Here 
we present the Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset 
of 483 high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including 379 
new genomes from 125 populations, which we group into diversity and selection
sets. We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of continent-wide patterns of
heterozygosity, long- and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and
changes in effective population size through time as well as for signals of
positive or balancing selection. We find a genetic signature in present-day
Papuans that suggests that at least 2% of their genome originates from an early
and largely extinct expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) out of Africa.
Together with evidence from the western Asian fossil record, and admixture
between AMHs and Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion, our results 
contribute to the mounting evidence for the presence of AMHs out of Africa
earlier than 75,000 years ago.

Nanometre-scale pores and capillaries have long been studied because of their
importance in many natural phenomena and their use in numerous applications. A
more recent development is the ability to fabricate artificial capillaries with
nanometre dimensions, which has enabled new research on molecular transport and
led to the emergence of nanofluidics. But surface roughness in particular makes
it challenging to produce capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions at
this spatial scale. Here we report the fabrication of narrow and smooth
capillaries through van der Waals assembly, with atomically flat sheets at the
top and bottom separated by spacers made of two-dimensional crystals with a
precisely controlled number of layers. We use graphene and its multilayers as
archetypal two-dimensional materials to demonstrate this technology, which
produces structures that can be viewed as if individual atomic planes had been
removed from a bulk crystal to leave behind flat voids of a height chosen with
atomic-scale precision. Water transport through the channels, ranging in height
from one to several dozen atomic planes, is characterized by unexpectedly fast
flow (up to 1 metre per second) that we attribute to high capillary pressures
(about 1,000 bar) and large slip lengths. For channels that accommodate only a
few layers of water, the flow exhibits a marked enhancement that we associate
with an increased structural order in nanoconfined water. Our work opens up an
avenue to making capillaries and cavities with sizes tunable to ångström
precision, and with permeation properties further controlled through a wide
choice of atomically flat materials available for channel walls.

Sleep is a fundamental biological process observed widely in the animal kingdom, 
but the neural circuits generating sleep remain poorly understood. Understanding 
the brain mechanisms controlling sleep requires the identification of key neurons
in the control circuits and mapping of their synaptic connections. Technical
innovations over the past decade have greatly facilitated dissection of the sleep
circuits. This has set the stage for understanding how a variety of environmental
and physiological factors influence sleep. The ability to initiate and terminate 
sleep on command will also help us to elucidate its functions within and beyond
the brain.

Lower olefins-generally referring to ethylene, propylene and butylene-are basic
carbon-based building blocks that are widely used in the chemical industry, and
are traditionally produced through thermal or catalytic cracking of a range of
hydrocarbon feedstocks, such as naphtha, gas oil, condensates and light alkanes. 
With the rapid depletion of the limited petroleum reserves that serve as the
source of these hydrocarbons, there is an urgent need for processes that can
produce lower olefins from alternative feedstocks. The 'Fischer-Tropsch to
olefins' (FTO) process has long offered a way of producing lower olefins directly
from syngas-a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that is readily derived
from coal, biomass and natural gas. But the hydrocarbons obtained with the FTO
process typically follow the so-called Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution, which 
is characterized by a maximum C2-C4 hydrocarbon fraction of about 56.7 per cent
and an undesired methane fraction of about 29.2 per cent (refs 1, 10, 11, 12).
Here we show that, under mild reaction conditions, cobalt carbide quadrangular
nanoprisms catalyse the FTO conversion of syngas with high selectivity for the
production of lower olefins (constituting around 60.8 per cent of the carbon
products), while generating little methane (about 5.0 per cent), with the ratio
of desired unsaturated hydrocarbons to less valuable saturated hydrocarbons
amongst the C2-C4 products being as high as 30. Detailed catalyst
characterization during the initial reaction stage and theoretical calculations
indicate that preferentially exposed {101} and {020} facets play a pivotal role
during syngas conversion, in that they favour olefin production and inhibit
methane formation, and thereby render cobalt carbide nanoprisms a promising new
catalyst system for directly converting syngas into lower olefins.

Methane has the second-largest global radiative forcing impact of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases after carbon dioxide, but our understanding of the global
atmospheric methane budget is incomplete. The global fossil fuel industry
(production and usage of natural gas, oil and coal) is thought to contribute 15
to 22 per cent of methane emissions to the total atmospheric methane budget.
However, questions remain regarding methane emission trends as a result of fossil
fuel industrial activity and the contribution to total methane emissions of
sources from the fossil fuel industry and from natural geological seepage, which 
are often co-located. Here we re-evaluate the global methane budget and the
contribution of the fossil fuel industry to methane emissions based on long-term 
global methane and methane carbon isotope records. We compile the largest
isotopic methane source signature database so far, including fossil fuel,
microbial and biomass-burning methane emission sources. We find that total fossil
fuel methane emissions (fossil fuel industry plus natural geological seepage) are
not increasing over time, but are 60 to 110 per cent greater than current
estimates owing to large revisions in isotope source signatures. We show that
this is consistent with the observed global latitudinal methane gradient. After
accounting for natural geological methane seepage, we find that methane emissions
from natural gas, oil and coal production and their usage are 20 to 60 per cent
greater than inventories. Our findings imply a greater potential for the fossil
fuel industry to mitigate anthropogenic climate forcing, but we also find that
methane emissions from natural gas as a fraction of production have declined from
approximately 8 per cent to approximately 2 per cent over the past three decades.

The lipolysis pathway sustains normal and transformed stem cells in adult
Drosophila.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may be responsible for tumour dormancy, relapse and the 
eventual death of most cancer patients. In addition, these cells are usually
resistant to cytotoxic conditions. However, very little is known about the
biology behind this resistance to therapeutics. Here we investigated stem-cell
death in the digestive system of adult Drosophila melanogaster. We found that
knockdown of the coat protein complex I (COPI)-Arf79F (also known as Arf1)
complex selectively killed normal and transformed stem cells through necrosis, by
attenuating the lipolysis pathway, but spared differentiated cells. The dying
stem cells were engulfed by neighbouring differentiated cells through a
draper-myoblast city-Rac1-basket (also known as JNK)-dependent autophagy pathway.
Furthermore, Arf1 inhibitors reduced CSCs in human cancer cell lines. Thus,
normal or cancer stem cells may rely primarily on lipid reserves for energy, in
such a way that blocking lipolysis starves them to death. This finding may lead
to new therapies that could help to eliminate CSCs in human cancers.

The common participation of oncogenic KRAS proteins in many of the most lethal
human cancers, together with the ease of detecting somatic KRAS mutant alleles in
patient samples, has spurred persistent and intensive efforts to develop drugs
that inhibit KRAS activity. However, advances have been hindered by the pervasive
inter- and intra-lineage diversity in the targetable mechanisms that underlie
KRAS-driven cancers, limited pharmacological accessibility of many candidate
synthetic-lethal interactions and the swift emergence of unanticipated resistance
mechanisms to otherwise effective targeted therapies. Here we demonstrate the
acute and specific cell-autonomous addiction of KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung
cancer cells to receptor-dependent nuclear export. A multi-genomic, data-driven
approach, utilizing 106 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines, was used to 
interrogate 4,725 biological processes with 39,760 short interfering RNA pools
for those selectively required for the survival of KRAS-mutant cells that harbour
a broad spectrum of phenotypic variation. Nuclear transport machinery was the
sole process-level discriminator of statistical significance. Chemical
perturbation of the nuclear export receptor XPO1 (also known as CRM1), with a
clinically available drug, revealed a robust synthetic-lethal interaction with
native or engineered oncogenic KRAS both in vitro and in vivo. The primary
mechanism underpinning XPO1 inhibitor sensitivity was intolerance to the
accumulation of nuclear IκBα (also known as NFKBIA), with consequent inhibition
of NFκB transcription factor activity. Intrinsic resistance associated with
concurrent FSTL5 mutations was detected and determined to be a consequence of
YAP1 activation via a previously unappreciated FSTL5-Hippo pathway regulatory
axis. This occurs in approximately 17% of KRAS-mutant lung cancers, and can be
overcome with the co-administration of a YAP1-TEAD inhibitor. These findings
indicate that clinically available XPO1 inhibitors are a promising therapeutic
strategy for a considerable cohort of patients with lung cancer when coupled to
genomics-guided patient selection and observation.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are crucial for
many forms of neuronal plasticity, including structural long-term potentiation
(sLTP), which is a correlate of an animal's learning. However, it is unknown
whether BDNF release and TrkB activation occur during sLTP, and if so, when and
where. Here, using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensor for TrkB
and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we monitor TrkB activity
in single dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cultured murine
hippocampal slices. In response to sLTP induction, we find fast (onset < 1 min)
and sustained (>20 min) activation of TrkB in the stimulated spine that depends
on NMDAR (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) and CaMKII signalling and on
postsynaptically synthesized BDNF. We confirm the presence of postsynaptic BDNF
using electron microscopy to localize endogenous BDNF to dendrites and spines of 
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Consistent with these findings, we also show
rapid, glutamate-uncaging-evoked, time-locked BDNF release from single dendritic 
spines using BDNF fused to superecliptic pHluorin. We demonstrate that this
postsynaptic BDNF-TrkB signalling pathway is necessary for both structural and
functional LTP. Together, these findings reveal a spine-autonomous, autocrine
signalling mechanism involving NMDAR-CaMKII-dependent BDNF release from
stimulated dendritic spines and subsequent TrkB activation on these same spines
that is crucial for structural and functional plasticity.

The Rho GTPase proteins Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 have a central role in regulating
the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, thereby exerting control over the
structural and functional plasticity of spines and, ultimately, learning and
memory. Although previous work has shown that precise spatiotemporal coordination
of these GTPases is crucial for some forms of cell morphogenesis, the nature of
such coordination during structural spine plasticity is unclear. Here we describe
a three-molecule model of structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) of murine
dendritic spines, implicating the localized, coincident activation of Rac1, RhoA 
and Cdc42 as a causal signal of sLTP. This model posits that complete tripartite 
signal overlap in spines confers sLTP, but that partial overlap primes spines for
structural plasticity. By monitoring the spatiotemporal activation patterns of
these GTPases during sLTP, we find that such spatiotemporal signal
complementation simultaneously explains three integral features of plasticity:
the facilitation of plasticity by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the
postsynaptic source of which activates Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA;
heterosynaptic facilitation of sLTP, which is conveyed by diffusive Rac1 and RhoA
activity; and input specificity, which is afforded by spine-restricted Cdc42
activity. Thus, we present a form of biochemical computation in dendrites
involving the controlled complementation of three molecules that simultaneously
ensures signal specificity and primes the system for plasticity.

Modality-specific sensory inputs from individual sense organs are processed in
parallel in distinct areas of the neocortex. For each sensory modality, input
follows a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop in which a 'first-order' exteroceptive
thalamic nucleus sends peripheral input to the primary sensory cortex, which
projects back to a 'higher order' thalamic nucleus that targets a secondary
sensory cortex. This conserved circuit motif raises the possibility that shared
genetic programs exist across sensory modalities. Here we report that, despite
their association with distinct sensory modalities, first-order nuclei in mice
are genetically homologous across somatosensory, visual, and auditory pathways,
as are higher order nuclei. We further reveal peripheral input-dependent control 
over the transcriptional identity and connectivity of first-order nuclei by
showing that input ablation leads to induction of higher-order-type
transcriptional programs and rewiring of higher-order-directed descending
cortical input to deprived first-order nuclei. These findings uncover an
input-dependent genetic logic for the design and plasticity of sensory pathways, 
in which conserved developmental programs lead to conserved circuit motifs across
sensory modalities.

On the basis of fossil and archaeological data it has been hypothesized that the 
exodus of Homo sapiens out of Africa and into Eurasia between ~50-120 thousand
years ago occurred in several orbitally paced migration episodes. Crossing
vegetated pluvial corridors from northeastern Africa into the Arabian Peninsula
and the Levant and expanding further into Eurasia, Australia and the Americas,
early H. sapiens experienced massive time-varying climate and sea level
conditions on a variety of timescales. Hitherto it has remained difficult to
quantify the effect of glacial- and millennial-scale climate variability on early
human dispersal and evolution. Here we present results from a numerical human
dispersal model, which is forced by spatiotemporal estimates of climate and sea
level changes over the past 125 thousand years. The model simulates the overall
dispersal of H. sapiens in close agreement with archaeological and fossil data
and features prominent glacial migration waves across the Arabian Peninsula and
the Levant region around 106-94, 89-73, 59-47 and 45-29 thousand years ago. The
findings document that orbital-scale global climate swings played a key role in
shaping Late Pleistocene global population distributions, whereas
millennial-scale abrupt climate changes, associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger
events, had a more limited regional effect.

In Gram-negative bacteria, outer membrane transporters import nutrients by
coupling to an inner membrane protein complex called the Ton complex. The Ton
complex consists of TonB, ExbB, and ExbD, and uses the proton motive force at the
inner membrane to transduce energy to the outer membrane via TonB. Here, we
structurally characterize the Ton complex from Escherichia coli using X-ray
crystallography, electron microscopy, double electron-electron resonance (DEER)
spectroscopy, and crosslinking. Our results reveal a stoichiometry consisting of 
a pentamer of ExbB, a dimer of ExbD, and at least one TonB. Electrophysiology
studies show that the Ton subcomplex forms pH-sensitive cation-selective channels
and provide insight into the mechanism by which it may harness the proton motive 
force to produce energy.

Although lysine acetylation is now recognized as a general protein modification
for both histones and non-histone proteins, the mechanisms of
acetylation-mediated actions are not completely understood. Acetylation of the
C-terminal domain (CTD) of p53 (also known as TP53) was an early example of
non-histone protein acetylation and its precise role remains unclear. Lysine
acetylation often creates binding sites for bromodomain-containing 'reader'
proteins. Here we use a proteomic screen to identify the oncoprotein SET as a
major cellular factor whose binding with p53 is dependent on CTD acetylation
status. SET profoundly inhibits p53 transcriptional activity in unstressed cells,
but SET-mediated repression is abolished by stress-induced acetylation of p53
CTD. Moreover, loss of the interaction with SET activates p53, resulting in
tumour regression in mouse xenograft models. Notably, the acidic domain of SET
acts as a 'reader' for the unacetylated CTD of p53 and this mechanism of
acetylation-dependent regulation is widespread in nature. For example,
acetylation of p53 also modulates its interactions with similar acidic domains
found in other p53 regulators including VPRBP (also known as DCAF1), DAXX and
PELP1 (refs. 7, 8, 9), and computational analysis of the proteome has identified 
numerous proteins with the potential to serve as acidic domain readers and
lysine-rich ligands. Unlike bromodomain readers, which preferentially bind the
acetylated forms of their cognate ligands, the acidic domain readers specifically
recognize the unacetylated forms of their ligands. Finally, the
acetylation-dependent regulation of p53 was further validated in vivo by using a 
knock-in mouse model expressing an acetylation-mimicking form of p53. These
results reveal that acidic-domain-containing factors act as a class of
acetylation-dependent regulators by targeting p53 and, potentially, other
proteins.

P2X receptors are trimeric, non-selective cation channels activated by ATP that
have important roles in the cardiovascular, neuronal and immune systems. Despite 
their central function in human physiology and although they are potential
targets of therapeutic agents, there are no structures of human P2X receptors.
The mechanisms of receptor desensitization and ion permeation, principles of
antagonism, and complete structures of the pore-forming transmembrane domains of 
these receptors remain unclear. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of the
human P2X3 receptor in apo/resting, agonist-bound/open-pore,
agonist-bound/closed-pore/desensitized and antagonist-bound/closed states. The
open state structure harbours an intracellular motif we term the 'cytoplasmic
cap', which stabilizes the open state of the ion channel pore and creates
lateral, phospholipid-lined cytoplasmic fenestrations for water and ion egress.
The competitive antagonists TNP-ATP and A-317491 stabilize the apo/resting state 
and reveal the interactions responsible for competitive inhibition. These
structures illuminate the conformational rearrangements that underlie P2X
receptor gating and provide a foundation for the development of new
pharmacological agents.

Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first enzyme of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain and is composed of 45 subunits in humans, making 
it one of the largest known multi-subunit membrane protein complexes. Complex I
exists in supercomplex forms with respiratory chain complexes III and IV, which
are together required for the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient used 
for the synthesis of ATP. Complex I is also a major source of damaging reactive
oxygen species and its dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial disease,
Parkinson's disease and ageing. Bacterial and human complex I share 14 core
subunits that are essential for enzymatic function; however, the role and
necessity of the remaining 31 human accessory subunits is unclear. The
incorporation of accessory subunits into the complex increases the cellular
energetic cost and has necessitated the involvement of numerous assembly factors 
for complex I biogenesis. Here we use gene editing to generate human knockout
cell lines for each accessory subunit. We show that 25 subunits are strictly
required for assembly of a functional complex and 1 subunit is essential for cell
viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cell lines revealed that loss of
each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same
structural module. Analysis of proteomic changes after the loss of specific
modules revealed that ATP5SL and DMAC1 are required for assembly of the distal
portion of the complex I membrane arm. Our results demonstrate the broad
importance of accessory subunits in the structure and function of human complex
I. Coupling gene-editing technology with proteomics represents a powerful tool
for dissecting large multi-subunit complexes and enables the study of complex
dysfunction at a cellular level.

The presence of solid carbonaceous matter in cometary dust was established by the
detection of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in particles 
from comet 1P/Halley. Such matter is generally thought to have originated in the 
interstellar medium, but it might have formed in the solar nebula-the cloud of
gas and dust that was left over after the Sun formed. This solid carbonaceous
material cannot be observed from Earth, so it has eluded unambiguous
characterization. Many gaseous organic molecules, however, have been observed;
they come mostly from the sublimation of ices at the surface or in the subsurface
of cometary nuclei. These ices could have been formed from material inherited
from the interstellar medium that suffered little processing in the solar nebula.
Here we report the in situ detection of solid organic matter in the dust
particles emitted by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; the carbon in this organic 
material is bound in very large macromolecular compounds, analogous to the
insoluble organic matter found in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The
organic matter in meteorites might have formed in the interstellar medium and/or 
the solar nebula, but was almost certainly modified in the meteorites' parent
bodies. We conclude that the observed cometary carbonaceous solid matter could
have the same origin as the meteoritic insoluble organic matter, but suffered
less modification before and/or after being incorporated into the comet.

The band theory of solids is arguably the most successful theory of
condensed-matter physics, providing a description of the electronic energy levels
in various materials. Electronic wavefunctions obtained from the band theory
enable a topological characterization of metals for which the electronic spectrum
may host robust, topologically protected, fermionic quasiparticles. Many of these
quasiparticles are analogues of the elementary particles of the Standard Model,
but others do not have a counterpart in relativistic high-energy theories. A
complete list of possible quasiparticles in solids is lacking, even in the
non-interacting case. Here we describe the possible existence of a hitherto
unrecognized type of fermionic excitation in metals. This excitation forms a
nodal chain-a chain of connected loops in momentum space-along which conduction
and valence bands touch. We prove that the nodal chain is topologically distinct 
from previously reported excitations. We discuss the symmetry requirements for
the appearance of this excitation and predict that it is realized in an existing 
material, iridium tetrafluoride (IrF4), as well as in other compounds of this
class of materials. Using IrF4 as an example, we provide a discussion of the
topological surface states associated with the nodal chain. We argue that the
presence of the nodal-chain fermions will result in anomalous magnetotransport
properties, distinct from those of materials exhibiting previously known
excitations.

Patterning of colloidal particles with chemically or topographically distinct
surface domains (patches) has attracted intense research interest.
Surface-patterned particles act as colloidal analogues of atoms and molecules,
serve as model systems in studies of phase transitions in liquid systems, behave 
as 'colloidal surfactants' and function as templates for the synthesis of hybrid 
particles. The generation of micrometre- and submicrometre-sized patchy colloids 
is now efficient, but surface patterning of inorganic colloidal nanoparticles
with dimensions of the order of tens of nanometres is uncommon. Such
nanoparticles exhibit size- and shape-dependent optical, electronic and magnetic 
properties, and their assemblies show new collective properties. At present,
nanoparticle patterning is limited to the generation of two-patch nanoparticles, 
and nanoparticles with surface ripples or a 'raspberry' surface morphology. Here 
we demonstrate nanoparticle surface patterning, which utilizes thermodynamically 
driven segregation of polymer ligands from a uniform polymer brush into
surface-pinned micelles following a change in solvent quality. Patch formation is
reversible but can be permanently preserved using a photocrosslinking step. The
methodology offers the ability to control the dimensions of patches, their
spatial distribution and the number of patches per nanoparticle, in agreement
with a theoretical model. The versatility of the strategy is demonstrated by
patterning nanoparticles with different dimensions, shapes and compositions,
tethered with various types of polymers and subjected to different external
stimuli. These patchy nanocolloids have potential applications in fundamental
research, the self-assembly of nanomaterials, diagnostics, sensing and colloidal 
stabilization.

Circadian rhythms have evolved to anticipate and adapt animals to the constraints
of the earth's 24-hour light cycle. Although the molecular processes that
establish periodicity in clock neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are
well understood, the mechanisms by which axonal projections from the central
clock drive behavioural rhythms are unknown. Here we show that the sleep period
in mice (Zeitgeber time, ZT0-12) is preceded by an increase in water intake
promoted entirely by the central clock, and not motivated by physiological need. 
Mice denied this surge experienced significant dehydration near the end of the
sleep period, indicating that this water intake contributes to the maintenance of
overnight hydromineral balance. Furthermore, this effect relies specifically on
the activity of SCN vasopressin (VP) neurons that project to thirst neurons in
the OVLT (organum vasculosum lamina terminalis), where VP is released as a
neurotransmitter. SCN VP neurons become electrically active during the
anticipatory period (ZT21.5-23.5), and depolarize and excite OVLT neurons through
the activation of postsynaptic VP V1a receptors and downstream non-selective
cation channels. Optogenetic induction of VP release before the anticipatory
period (basal period; ZT19.5-21.5) excited OVLT neurons and prompted a surge in
water intake. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of VP release during the
anticipatory period inhibited the firing of OVLT neurons and prevented the
corresponding increase in water intake. Our findings reveal the existence of
anticipatory thirst, and demonstrate this behaviour to be driven by excitatory
peptidergic neurotransmission mediated by VP release from central clock neurons.

Networks of organic chemical reactions are important in life and probably played 
a central part in its origin. Network dynamics regulate cell division, circadian 
rhythms, nerve impulses and chemotaxis, and guide the development of organisms.
Although out-of-equilibrium networks of chemical reactions have the potential to 
display emergent network dynamics such as spontaneous pattern formation,
bistability and periodic oscillations, the principles that enable networks of
organic reactions to develop complex behaviours are incompletely understood. Here
we describe a network of biologically relevant organic reactions (amide
formation, thiolate-thioester exchange, thiolate-disulfide interchange and
conjugate addition) that displays bistability and oscillations in the
concentrations of organic thiols and amides. Oscillations arise from the
interaction between three subcomponents of the network: an autocatalytic cycle
that generates thiols and amides from thioesters and dialkyl disulfides; a
trigger that controls autocatalytic growth; and inhibitory processes that remove 
activating thiol species that are produced during the autocatalytic cycle. In
contrast to previous studies that have demonstrated oscillations and bistability 
using highly evolved biomolecules (enzymes and DNA) or inorganic molecules of
questionable biochemical relevance (for example, those used in
Belousov-Zhabotinskii-type reactions), the organic molecules we use are relevant 
to metabolism and similar to those that might have existed on the early Earth. By
using small organic molecules to build a network of organic reactions with
autocatalytic, bistable and oscillatory behaviour, we identify principles that
explain the ways in which dynamic networks relevant to life could have developed.
Modifications of this network will clarify the influence of molecular structure
on the dynamics of reaction networks, and may enable the design of biomimetic
networks and of synthetic self-regulating and evolving chemical systems.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides fine spatial resolution, spectral
sensitivity and a rich variety of contrast mechanisms for diagnostic medical
applications. Nuclear imaging using γ-ray cameras offers the benefits of using
small quantities of radioactive tracers that seek specific targets of interest
within the body. Here we describe an imaging and spectroscopic modality that
combines favourable aspects of both approaches. Spatial information is encoded
into the spin orientations of tiny amounts of a polarized radioactive tracer
using pulses of both radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation and magnetic-field
gradients, as in MRI. However, rather than detecting weak radio-frequency
signals, imaging information is obtained through the detection of γ-rays. A
single γ-ray detector can be used to acquire an image; no γ-ray camera is needed.
We demonstrate the feasibility of our technique by producing images and spectra
from a glass cell containing only about 4 × 10(13) atoms (about 1 millicurie) of 
the metastable isomer (131m)Xe that were polarized using the laser technique of
spin-exchange optical pumping. If the cell had instead been filled with water and
imaged using conventional MRI, then it would have contained more than 10(24)
water molecules. The high sensitivity of our modality expands the breadth of
applications of magnetic resonance, and could lead to a new class of radioactive 
tracers.

Ocean microbes drive biogeochemical cycling on a global scale. However, this
cycling is constrained by viruses that affect community composition, metabolic
activity, and evolutionary trajectories. Owing to challenges with the sampling
and cultivation of viruses, genome-level viral diversity remains poorly described
and grossly understudied, with less than 1% of observed surface-ocean viruses
known. Here we assemble complete genomes and large genomic fragments from both
surface- and deep-ocean viruses sampled during the Tara Oceans and Malaspina
research expeditions, and analyse the resulting 'global ocean virome' dataset to 
present a global map of abundant, double-stranded DNA viruses complete with
genomic and ecological contexts. A total of 15,222 epipelagic and mesopelagic
viral populations were identified, comprising 867 viral clusters (defined as
approximately genus-level groups). This roughly triples the number of known ocean
viral populations and doubles the number of candidate bacterial and archaeal
virus genera, providing a near-complete sampling of epipelagic communities at
both the population and viral-cluster level. We found that 38 of the 867 viral
clusters were locally or globally abundant, together accounting for nearly half
of the viral populations in any global ocean virome sample. While two-thirds of
these clusters represent newly described viruses lacking any cultivated
representative, most could be computationally linked to dominant, ecologically
relevant microbial hosts. Moreover, we identified 243 viral-encoded auxiliary
metabolic genes, of which only 95 were previously known. Deeper analyses of four 
of these auxiliary metabolic genes (dsrC, soxYZ, P-II (also known as glnB) and
amoC) revealed that abundant viruses may directly manipulate sulfur and nitrogen 
cycling throughout the epipelagic ocean. This viral catalog and functional
analyses provide a necessary foundation for the meaningful integration of viruses
into ecosystem models where they act as key players in nutrient cycling and
trophic networks.

A bio-based economy has the potential to provide sustainable substitutes for
petroleum-based products and new chemical building blocks for advanced materials.
We previously engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for industrial production of
the isoprenoid artemisinic acid for use in antimalarial treatments. Adapting
these strains for biosynthesis of other isoprenoids such as β-farnesene (C15H24),
a plant sesquiterpene with versatile industrial applications, is straightforward.
However, S. cerevisiae uses a chemically inefficient pathway for isoprenoid
biosynthesis, resulting in yield and productivity limitations incompatible with
commodity-scale production. Here we use four non-native metabolic reactions to
rewire central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae, enabling biosynthesis of
cytosolic acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA, the two-carbon isoprenoid precursor)
with a reduced ATP requirement, reduced loss of carbon to CO2-emitting reactions,
and improved pathway redox balance. We show that strains with rewired central
metabolism can devote an identical quantity of sugar to farnesene production as
control strains, yet produce 25% more farnesene with that sugar while requiring
75% less oxygen. These changes lower feedstock costs and dramatically increase
productivity in industrial fermentations which are by necessity
oxygen-constrained. Despite altering key regulatory nodes, engineered strains
grow robustly under taxing industrial conditions, maintaining stable yield for
two weeks in broth that reaches >15% farnesene by volume. This illustrates that
rewiring yeast central metabolism is a viable strategy for cost-effective,
large-scale production of acetyl-CoA-derived molecules.

The respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV (CI, CIII and CIV) are present in
the bacterial membrane or the inner mitochondrial membrane and have a role of
transferring electrons and establishing the proton gradient for ATP synthesis by 
complex V. The respiratory chain complexes can assemble into supercomplexes
(SCs), but their precise arrangement is unknown. Here we report a 5.4 Å
cryo-electron microscopy structure of the major 1.7 megadalton SCI1III2IV1
respirasome purified from porcine heart. The CIII dimer and CIV bind at the same 
side of the L-shaped CI, with their transmembrane domains essentially aligned to 
form a transmembrane disk. Compared to free CI, the CI in the respirasome is more
compact because of interactions with CIII and CIV. The NDUFA11 and NDUFB9
supernumerary subunits of CI contribute to the oligomerization of CI and CIII.
The structure of the respirasome provides information on the precise arrangements
of the respiratory chain complexes in mitochondria.

Mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes are organized into
supercomplexes responsible for carrying out cellular respiration. Here we present
three architectures of mammalian (ovine) supercomplexes determined by
cryo-electron microscopy. We identify two distinct arrangements of supercomplex
CICIII2CIV (the respirasome)-a major 'tight' form and a minor 'loose' form
(resolved at the resolution of 5.8 Å and 6.7 Å, respectively), which may
represent different stages in supercomplex assembly or disassembly. We have also 
determined an architecture of supercomplex CICIII2 at 7.8 Å resolution. All
observed density can be attributed to the known 80 subunits of the individual
complexes, including 132 transmembrane helices. The individual complexes form
tight interactions that vary between the architectures, with complex IV subunit
COX7a switching contact from complex III to complex I. The arrangement of active 
sites within the supercomplex may help control reactive oxygen species
production. To our knowledge, these are the first complete architectures of the
dominant, physiologically relevant state of the electron transport chain.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a range of neurodevelopmental disorders 
characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as by
restricted and repetitive behaviours. ASD has a strong genetic component with
high heritability. Exome sequencing analysis has recently identified many de novo
mutations in a variety of genes in individuals with ASD, with CHD8, a gene
encoding a chromatin remodeller, being most frequently affected. Whether CHD8
mutations are causative for ASD and how they might establish ASD traits have
remained unknown. Here we show that mice heterozygous for Chd8 mutations manifest
ASD-like behavioural characteristics including increased anxiety, repetitive
behaviour, and altered social behaviour. CHD8 haploinsufficiency did not result
in prominent changes in the expression of a few specific genes but instead gave
rise to small but global changes in gene expression in the mouse brain,
reminiscent of those in the brains of patients with ASD. Gene set enrichment
analysis revealed that neurodevelopment was delayed in the mutant mouse embryos. 
Furthermore, reduced expression of CHD8 was associated with abnormal activation
of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which suppresses the transcription
of many neuronal genes. REST activation was also observed in the brains of humans
with ASD, and CHD8 was found to interact physically with REST in the mouse brain.
Our results are thus consistent with the notion that CHD8 haploinsufficiency is a
highly penetrant risk factor for ASD, with disease pathogenesis probably
resulting from a delay in neurodevelopment.

Sustainably feeding the world's growing population is a challenge, and closing
yield gaps (that is, differences between farmers' yields and what are attainable 
for a given region) is a vital strategy to address this challenge. The magnitude 
of yield gaps is particularly large in developing countries where smallholder
farming dominates the agricultural landscape. Many factors and constraints
interact to limit yields, and progress in problem-solving to bring about changes 
at the ground level is rare. Here we present an innovative approach for enabling 
smallholders to achieve yield and economic gains sustainably via the Science and 
Technology Backyard (STB) platform. STB involves agricultural scientists living
in villages among farmers, advancing participatory innovation and technology
transfer, and garnering public and private support. We identified multifaceted
yield-limiting factors involving agronomic, infrastructural, and socioeconomic
conditions. When these limitations and farmers' concerns were addressed, the
farmers adopted recommended management practices, thereby improving production
outcomes. In one region in China, the five-year average yield increased from
67.9% of the attainable level to 97.0% among 71 leading farmers, and from 62.8%
to 79.6% countywide (93,074 households); this was accompanied by resource and
economic benefits.

Increasing grain yield is a long-term goal in crop breeding to meet the demand
for global food security. Heterosis, when a hybrid shows higher performance for a
trait than both parents, offers an important strategy for crop breeding. To
examine the genetic basis of heterosis for yield in rice, here we generate,
sequence and record the phenotypes of 10,074 F2 lines from 17 representative
hybrid rice crosses. We classify modern hybrid rice varieties into three groups, 
representing different hybrid breeding systems. Although we do not find any
heterosis-associated loci shared across all lines, within each group, a small
number of genomic loci from female parents explain a large proportion of the
yield advantage of hybrids over their male parents. For some of these loci, we
find support for partial dominance of heterozygous locus for yield-related traits
and better-parent heterosis for overall performance when all of the grain-yield
traits are considered together. These results inform on the genomic architecture 
of heterosis and rice hybrid breeding.

Mantle melting, which leads to the formation of oceanic and continental crust,
together with crust recycling through plate tectonics, are the primary processes 
that drive the chemical differentiation of the silicate Earth. The present-day
mantle, as sampled by oceanic basalts, shows large chemical and isotopic
variability bounded by a few end-member compositions. Among these, the HIMU
end-member (having a high U/Pb ratio, μ) has been generally considered to
represent subducted/recycled basaltic oceanic crust. However, this concept has
been challenged by recent studies of the mantle source of HIMU magmas. For
example, analyses of olivine phenocrysts in HIMU lavas indicate derivation from
the partial melting of peridotite, rather than from the pyroxenitic remnants of
recycled oceanic basalt. Here we report data that elucidate the source of these
lavas: high-precision trace-element analyses of olivine phenocrysts point to
peridotite that has been metasomatized by carbonatite fluids. Moreover,
similarities in the trace-element patterns of carbonatitic melt inclusions in
diamonds and HIMU lavas indicate that the metasomatism occurred in the
subcontinental lithospheric mantle, fused to the base of the continental crust
and isolated from mantle convection. Taking into account evidence from sulfur
isotope data for Archean to early Proterozoic surface material in the deep HIMU
mantle source, a multi-stage evolution is revealed for the HIMU end-member,
spanning more than half of Earth's history. Before entrainment in the convecting 
mantle, storage in a boundary layer, upwelling as a mantle plume and partial
melting to become ocean island basalt, the HIMU source formed as Archean-early
Proterozoic subduction-related carbonatite-metasomatized subcontinental
lithospheric mantle.

Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the
networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are
continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell RNA sequencing is
greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive
descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic
multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest
mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such
mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental
potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription
factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to
regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of
the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the
cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell RNA
sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene 
selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory
states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show 
that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested
concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid
progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had
collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme,
instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9,
10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed
by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting
myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants
'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are
obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because
of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory
networks.

The field of biocatalysis has advanced from harnessing natural enzymes to using
directed evolution to obtain new biocatalysts with tailor-made functions. Several
tools have recently been developed to expand the natural enzymatic repertoire
with abiotic reactions. For example, artificial metalloenzymes, which combine the
versatile reaction scope of transition metals with the beneficial catalytic
features of enzymes, offer an attractive means to engineer new reactions. Three
complementary strategies exist: repurposing natural metalloenzymes for abiotic
transformations; in silico metalloenzyme (re-)design; and incorporation of
abiotic cofactors into proteins. The third strategy offers the opportunity to
design a wide variety of artificial metalloenzymes for non-natural reactions.
However, many metal cofactors are inhibited by cellular components and therefore 
require purification of the scaffold protein. This limits the throughput of
genetic optimization schemes applied to artificial metalloenzymes and their
applicability in vivo to expand natural metabolism. Here we report the
compartmentalization and in vivo evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme for
olefin metathesis, which represents an archetypal organometallic reaction without
equivalent in nature. Building on previous work on an artificial
metallohydrolase, we exploit the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction
compartment for the 'metathase' because it offers an auspicious environment for
artificial metalloenzymes, mainly owing to low concentrations of inhibitors such 
as glutathione, which has recently been identified as a major inhibitor. This
strategy facilitated the assembly of a functional metathase in vivo and its
directed evolution with substantially increased throughput compared to
conventional approaches that rely on purified protein variants. The evolved
metathase compares favourably with commercial catalysts, shows activity for
different metathesis substrates and can be further evolved in different
directions by adjusting the workflow. Our results represent the systematic
implementation and evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme that catalyses an
abiotic reaction in vivo, with potential applications in, for example,
non-natural metabolism.

Cataclysmic variable stars-novae, dwarf novae, and nova-likes-are close binary
systems consisting of a white dwarf star (the primary) that is accreting matter
from a low-mass companion star (the secondary). From time to time such systems
undergo large-amplitude brightenings. The most spectacular eruptions, with a
ten-thousandfold increase in brightness, occur in classical novae and are caused 
by a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of the white dwarf. Such eruptions are 
thought to recur on timescales of ten thousand to a million years. In between,
the system's properties depend primarily on the mass-transfer rate: if it is
lower than a billionth of a solar mass per year, the accretion becomes unstable
and the matter is dumped onto the white dwarf during quasi-periodic dwarf nova
outbursts. The hibernation hypothesis predicts that nova eruptions strongly
affect the mass-transfer rate in the binary, keeping it high for centuries after 
the event. Subsequently, the mass-transfer rate should significantly decrease for
a thousand to a million years, starting the hibernation phase. After that the
nova awakes again-with accretion returning to the pre-eruption level and leading 
to a new nova explosion. The hibernation model predicts cyclical evolution of
cataclysmic variables through phases of high and low mass-transfer. The theory
gained some support from the discovery of ancient nova shells around the dwarf
novae Z Camelopardalis and AT Cancri, but direct evidence for considerable
mass-transfer changes prior, during and after nova eruptions has not hitherto
been found. Here we report long-term observations of the classical nova V1213 Cen
(Nova Centauri 2009) covering its pre- and post-eruption phases and precisely
documenting its evolution. Within the six years before the explosion, the system 
revealed dwarf nova outbursts indicative of a low mass-transfer rate. The
post-nova is two orders of magnitude brighter than the pre-nova at minimum light 
with no trace of dwarf nova behaviour, implying that the mass-transfer rate
increased considerably as a result of the nova explosion.

Elongation of rod-shaped bacteria is mediated by a dynamic
peptidoglycan-synthetizing machinery called the Rod complex. Here we report that,
in Bacillus subtilis, this complex is functional in the absence of all known
peptidoglycan polymerases. Cells lacking these enzymes survive by inducing an
envelope stress response that increases the expression of RodA, a widely
conserved core component of the Rod complex. RodA is a member of the SEDS (shape,
elongation, division and sporulation) family of proteins, which have essential
but ill-defined roles in cell wall biogenesis during growth, division and
sporulation. Our genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that SEDS proteins
constitute a family of peptidoglycan polymerases. Thus, B. subtilis and probably 
most bacteria use two distinct classes of polymerase to synthesize their
exoskeleton. Our findings indicate that SEDS family proteins are core cell wall
synthases of the cell elongation and division machinery, and represent attractive
targets for antibiotic development.

Thirst motivates animals to drink in order to maintain fluid balance. Thirst has 
conventionally been viewed as a homeostatic response to changes in blood volume
or tonicity. However, most drinking behaviour is regulated too rapidly to be
controlled by blood composition directly, and instead seems to anticipate
homeostatic imbalances before they arise. How this is achieved remains unknown.
Here we reveal an unexpected role for the subfornical organ (SFO) in the
anticipatory regulation of thirst in mice. By monitoring deep-brain calcium
dynamics, we show that thirst-promoting SFO neurons respond to inputs from the
oral cavity during eating and drinking and then integrate these inputs with
information about the composition of the blood. This integration allows SFO
neurons to predict how ongoing food and water consumption will alter fluid
balance in the future and then to adjust behaviour pre-emptively. Complementary
optogenetic manipulations show that this anticipatory modulation is necessary for
drinking in several contexts. These findings provide a neural mechanism to
explain longstanding behavioural observations, including the prevalence of
drinking during meals, the rapid satiation of thirst, and the fact that oral
cooling is thirst-quenching.

Materials that exhibit simultaneous order in their electric and magnetic ground
states hold promise for use in next-generation memory devices in which electric
fields control magnetism. Such materials are exceedingly rare, however, owing to 
competing requirements for displacive ferroelectricity and magnetism. Despite the
recent identification of several new multiferroic materials and magnetoelectric
coupling mechanisms, known single-phase multiferroics remain limited by
antiferromagnetic or weak ferromagnetic alignments, by a lack of coupling between
the order parameters, or by having properties that emerge only well below room
temperature, precluding device applications. Here we present a methodology for
constructing single-phase multiferroic materials in which ferroelectricity and
strong magnetic ordering are coupled near room temperature. Starting with
hexagonal LuFeO3-the geometric ferroelectric with the greatest known planar
rumpling-we introduce individual monolayers of FeO during growth to construct
formula-unit-thick syntactic layers of ferrimagnetic LuFe2O4 (refs 17, 18) within
the LuFeO3 matrix, that is, (LuFeO3)m/(LuFe2O4)1 superlattices. The severe
rumpling imposed by the neighbouring LuFeO3 drives the ferrimagnetic LuFe2O4 into
a simultaneously ferroelectric state, while also reducing the LuFe2O4 spin
frustration. This increases the magnetic transition temperature
substantially-from 240 kelvin for LuFe2O4 (ref. 18) to 281 kelvin for
(LuFeO3)9/(LuFe2O4)1. Moreover, the ferroelectric order couples to the
ferrimagnetism, enabling direct electric-field control of magnetism at 200
kelvin. Our results demonstrate a design methodology for creating
higher-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroics by exploiting a combination of
geometric frustration, lattice distortions and epitaxial engineering.

Holographic techniques are fundamental to applications such as volumetric
displays, high-density data storage and optical tweezers that require spatial
control of intricate optical or acoustic fields within a three-dimensional
volume. The basis of holography is spatial storage of the phase and/or amplitude 
profile of the desired wavefront in a manner that allows that wavefront to be
reconstructed by interference when the hologram is illuminated with a suitable
coherent source. Modern computer-generated holography skips the process of
recording a hologram from a physical scene, and instead calculates the required
phase profile before rendering it for reconstruction. In ultrasound applications,
the phase profile is typically generated by discrete and independently driven
ultrasound sources; however, these can only be used in small numbers, which
limits the complexity or degrees of freedom that can be attained in the
wavefront. Here we introduce monolithic acoustic holograms, which can reconstruct
diffraction-limited acoustic pressure fields and thus arbitrary ultrasound beams.
We use rapid fabrication to craft the holograms and achieve reconstruction
degrees of freedom two orders of magnitude higher than commercial phased array
sources. The technique is inexpensive, appropriate for both transmission and
reflection elements, and scales well to higher information content, larger
aperture size and higher power. The complex three-dimensional pressure and phase 
distributions produced by these acoustic holograms allow us to demonstrate new
approaches to controlled ultrasonic manipulation of solids in water, and of
liquids and solids in air. We expect that acoustic holograms will enable new
capabilities in beam-steering and the contactless transfer of power, improve
medical imaging, and drive new applications of ultrasound.

In plants and algae, light serves both as the energy source for photosynthesis
and a biological signal that triggers cellular responses via specific sensory
photoreceptors. Red light is perceived by bilin-containing phytochromes and blue 
light by the flavin-containing cryptochromes and/or phototropins (PHOTs), the
latter containing two photosensory light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains.
Photoperception spans several orders of light intensity, ranging from far below
the threshold for photosynthesis to values beyond the capacity of photosynthetic 
CO2 assimilation. Excess light may cause oxidative damage and cell death,
processes prevented by enhanced thermal dissipation via high-energy quenching
(qE), a key photoprotective response. Here we show the existence of a molecular
link between photoreception, photosynthesis, and photoprotection in the green
alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that PHOT controls qE by inducing the
expression of the qE effector protein LHCSR3 (light-harvesting complex
stress-related protein 3) in high light intensities. This control requires
blue-light perception by LOV domains on PHOT, LHCSR3 induction through PHOT
kinase, and light dissipation in photosystem II via LHCSR3. Mutants deficient in 
the PHOT gene display severely reduced fitness under excessive light conditions, 
indicating that the sensing, utilization, and dissipation of light is a concerted
process that plays a vital role in microalgal acclimation to environments of
variable light intensities.

Histone modifications are fundamental epigenetic regulators that control many
crucial cellular processes. However, whether these marks can be passed on from
mammalian gametes to the next generation is a long-standing question that remains
unanswered. Here, by developing a highly sensitive approach, STAR ChIP-seq, we
provide a panoramic view of the landscape of H3K4me3, a histone hallmark for
transcription initiation, from developing gametes to post-implantation embryos.
We find that upon fertilization, extensive reprogramming occurs on the paternal
genome, as H3K4me3 peaks are depleted in zygotes but are readily observed after
major zygotic genome activation at the late two-cell stage. On the maternal
genome, we unexpectedly find a non-canonical form of H3K4me3 (ncH3K4me3) in
full-grown and mature oocytes, which exists as broad peaks at promoters and a
large number of distal loci. Such broad H3K4me3 peaks are in contrast to the
typical sharp H3K4me3 peaks restricted to CpG-rich regions of promoters. Notably,
ncH3K4me3 in oocytes overlaps almost exclusively with partially methylated DNA
domains. It is then inherited in pre-implantation embryos, before being erased in
the late two-cell embryos, when canonical H3K4me3 starts to be established. The
removal of ncH3K4me3 requires zygotic transcription but is independent of DNA
replication-mediated passive dilution. Finally, downregulation of H3K4me3 in
full-grown oocytes by overexpression of the H3K4me3 demethylase KDM5B is
associated with defects in genome silencing. Taken together, these data unveil
inheritance and highly dynamic reprogramming of the epigenome in early mammalian 
development.

Tumours progress despite being infiltrated by tumour-specific effector T cells.
Tumours contain areas of cellular necrosis, which are associated with poor
survival in a variety of cancers. Here, we show that necrosis releases
intracellular potassium ions into the extracellular fluid of mouse and human
tumours, causing profound suppression of T cell effector function. Elevation of
the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]e) impairs T cell receptor
(TCR)-driven Akt-mTOR phosphorylation and effector programmes. Potassium-mediated
suppression of Akt-mTOR signalling and T cell function is dependent upon the
activity of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. Although the suppressive
effect mediated by elevated [K+]e is independent of changes in plasma membrane
potential (Vm), it requires an increase in intracellular potassium ([K+]i).
Accordingly, augmenting potassium efflux in tumour-specific T cells by
overexpressing the potassium channel Kv1.3 lowers [K+]i and improves effector
functions in vitro and in vivo and enhances tumour clearance and survival in
melanoma-bearing mice. These results uncover an ionic checkpoint that blocks T
cell function in tumours and identify potential new strategies for cancer
immunotherapy.

Approximately one-third of all mammalian genes are essential for life. Phenotypes
resulting from knockouts of these genes in mice have provided tremendous insight 
into gene function and congenital disorders. As part of the International Mouse
Phenotyping Consortium effort to generate and phenotypically characterize 5,000
knockout mouse lines, here we identify 410 lethal genes during the production of 
the first 1,751 unique gene knockouts. Using a standardized phenotyping platform 
that incorporates high-resolution 3D imaging, we identify phenotypes at multiple 
time points for previously uncharacterized genes and additional phenotypes for
genes with previously reported mutant phenotypes. Unexpectedly, our analysis
reveals that incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are common even on a
defined genetic background. In addition, we show that human disease genes are
enriched for essential genes, thus providing a dataset that facilitates the
prioritization and validation of mutations identified in clinical sequencing
efforts.

Histone modifications have critical roles in regulating the expression of
developmental genes during embryo development in mammals. However, genome-wide
analyses of histone modifications in pre-implantation embryos have been impeded
by the scarcity of the required materials. Here, by using a small-scale chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) method, we map the
genome-wide profiles of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone 
H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which are associated with gene activation
and repression, respectively, in mouse pre-implantation embryos. We find that the
re-establishment of H3K4me3, especially on promoter regions, occurs much more
rapidly than that of H3K27me3 following fertilization, which is consistent with
the major wave of zygotic genome activation at the two-cell stage. Furthermore,
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 possess distinct features of sequence preference and
dynamics in pre-implantation embryos. Although H3K4me3 modifications occur
consistently at transcription start sites, the breadth of the H3K4me3 domain is a
highly dynamic feature. Notably, the broad H3K4me3 domain (wider than 5 kb) is
associated with higher transcription activity and cell identity not only in
pre-implantation development but also in the process of deriving embryonic stem
cells from the inner cell mass and trophoblast stem cells from the trophectoderm.
Compared to embryonic stem cells, we found that the bivalency (that is,
co-occurrence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) in early embryos is relatively infrequent 
and unstable. Taken together, our results provide a genome-wide map of H3K4me3
and H3K27me3 modifications in pre-implantation embryos, facilitating further
exploration of the mechanism for epigenetic regulation in early embryos.

Maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is essential for the formation of a new
individual, but is still poorly understood despite recent progress in analysis of
gene expression and DNA methylation in early embryogenesis. Dynamic histone
modifications may have important roles in MZT, but direct measurements of
chromatin states have been hindered by technical difficulties in profiling
histone modifications from small quantities of cells. Recent improvements allow
for 500 cell-equivalents of chromatin per reaction, but require 10,000 cells for 
initial steps or require a highly specialized microfluidics device that is not
readily available. We developed a micro-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation and
sequencing (μChIP-seq) method, which we used to profile genome-wide histone H3
lysine methylation (H3K4me3) and acetylation (H3K27ac) in mouse immature and
metaphase II oocytes and in 2-cell and 8-cell embryos. Notably, we show that ~22%
of the oocyte genome is associated with broad H3K4me3 domains that are
anti-correlated with DNA methylation. The H3K4me3 signal becomes confined to
transcriptional-start-site regions in 2-cell embryos, concomitant with the onset 
of major zygotic genome activation. Active removal of broad H3K4me3 domains by
the lysine demethylases KDM5A and KDM5B is required for normal zygotic genome
activation and is essential for early embryo development. Our results provide
insight into the onset of the developmental program in mouse embryos and
demonstrate a role for broad H3K4me3 domains in MZT.

Biological activity is a major factor in Earth's chemical cycles, including
facilitating CO2 sequestration and providing climate feedbacks. Thus a key
question in Earth's evolution is when did life arise and impact
hydrosphere-atmosphere-lithosphere chemical cycles? Until now, evidence for the
oldest life on Earth focused on debated stable isotopic signatures of 3,800-3,700
million year (Myr)-old metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and minerals from the Isua
supracrustal belt (ISB), southwest Greenland. Here we report evidence for ancient
life from a newly exposed outcrop of 3,700-Myr-old metacarbonate rocks in the ISB
that contain 1-4-cm-high stromatolites-macroscopically layered structures
produced by microbial communities. The ISB stromatolites grew in a shallow marine
environment, as indicated by seawater-like rare-earth element plus yttrium trace 
element signatures of the metacarbonates, and by interlayered detrital
sedimentary rocks with cross-lamination and storm-wave generated breccias. The
ISB stromatolites predate by 220 Myr the previous most convincing and generally
accepted multidisciplinary evidence for oldest life remains in the 3,480-Myr-old 
Dresser Formation of the Pilbara Craton, Australia. The presence of the ISB
stromatolites demonstrates the establishment of shallow marine carbonate
production with biotic CO2 sequestration by 3,700 million years ago (Ma), near
the start of Earth's sedimentary record. A sophistication of life by 3,700 Ma is 
in accord with genetic molecular clock studies placing life's origin in the
Hadean eon (>4,000 Ma).

Glutamate receptors are ligand-gated tetrameric ion channels that mediate
synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. They are instrumental in
vertebrate cognition and their dysfunction underlies diverse diseases. In both
the resting and desensitized states of AMPA and kainate receptor subtypes, the
ion channels are closed, whereas the ligand-binding domains, which are physically
coupled to the channels, adopt markedly different conformations. Without an
atomic model for the desensitized state, it is not possible to address a central 
problem in receptor gating: how the resting and desensitized receptor states both
display closed ion channels, although they have major differences in the
quaternary structure of the ligand-binding domain. Here, by determining the
structure of the kainate receptor GluK2 subtype in its desensitized state by
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at 3.8 Å resolution, we show that
desensitization is characterized by the establishment of a ring-like structure in
the ligand-binding domain layer of the receptor. Formation of this
'desensitization ring' is mediated by staggered helix contacts between adjacent
subunits, which leads to a pseudo-four-fold symmetric arrangement of the
ligand-binding domains, illustrating subtle changes in symmetry that are
important for the gating mechanism. Disruption of the desensitization ring is
probably the key switch that enables restoration of the receptor to its resting
state, thereby completing the gating cycle.

Homogeneous nucleation and subsequent cluster growth leads to the formation of
new aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The nucleation of sulfuric acid and
organic vapours is thought to be responsible for the formation of new particles
over continents, whereas iodine oxide vapours have been implicated in particle
formation over coastal regions. The molecular clustering pathways that are
involved in atmospheric particle formation have been elucidated in controlled
laboratory studies of chemically simple systems, but direct molecular-level
observations of nucleation in atmospheric field conditions that involve sulfuric 
acid, organic or iodine oxide vapours have yet to be reported. Here we present
field data from Mace Head, Ireland, and supporting data from northern Greenland
and Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, that enable us to identify the molecular steps
involved in new particle formation in an iodine-rich, coastal atmospheric
environment. We find that the formation and initial growth process is almost
exclusively driven by iodine oxoacids and iodine oxide vapours, with average
oxygen-to-iodine ratios of 2.4 found in the clusters. On the basis of this high
ratio, together with the high concentrations of iodic acid (HIO3) observed, we
suggest that cluster formation primarily proceeds by sequential addition of HIO3,
followed by intracluster restructuring to I2O5 and recycling of water either in
the atmosphere or on dehydration. Our study provides ambient atmospheric
molecular-level observations of nucleation, supporting the previously suggested
role of iodine-containing species in the formation of new aerosol particles, and 
identifies the key nucleating compound.

The Pliocene fossil 'Lucy' (Australopithecus afarensis) was discovered in the
Afar region of Ethiopia in 1974 and is among the oldest and most complete fossil 
hominin skeletons discovered. Here we propose, on the basis of close study of her
skeleton, that her cause of death was a vertical deceleration event or impact
following a fall from considerable height that produced compressive and hinge
(greenstick) fractures in multiple skeletal elements. Impacts that are so severe 
as to cause concomitant fractures usually also damage internal organs; together, 
these injuries are hypothesized to have caused her death. Lucy has been at the
centre of a vigorous debate about the role, if any, of arboreal locomotion in
early human evolution. It is therefore ironic that her death can be attributed to
injuries resulting from a fall, probably out of a tall tree, thus offering
unusual evidence for the presence of arborealism in this species.

Solid oxide cells (SOCs) can operate with high efficiency in two ways-as fuel
cells, oxidizing a fuel to produce electricity, and as electrolysis cells,
electrolysing water to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases. Ideally, SOCs should
perform well, be durable and be inexpensive, but there are often competitive
tensions, meaning that, for example, performance is achieved at the expense of
durability. SOCs consist of porous electrodes-the fuel and air
electrodes-separated by a dense electrolyte. In terms of the electrodes, the
greatest challenge is to deliver high, long-lasting electrocatalytic activity
while ensuring cost- and time-efficient manufacture. This has typically been
achieved through lengthy and intricate ex situ procedures. These often require
dedicated precursors and equipment; moreover, although the degradation of such
electrodes associated with their reversible operation can be mitigated, they are 
susceptible to many other forms of degradation. An alternative is to grow
appropriate electrode nanoarchitectures under operationally relevant conditions, 
for example, via redox exsolution. Here we describe the growth of a finely
dispersed array of anchored metal nanoparticles on an oxide electrode through
electrochemical poling of a SOC at 2 volts for a few seconds. These electrode
structures perform well as both fuel cells and electrolysis cells (for example,
at 900 °C they deliver 2 watts per square centimetre of power in humidified
hydrogen gas, and a current of 2.75 amps per square centimetre at 1.3 volts in
50% water/nitrogen gas). The nanostructures and corresponding electrochemical
activity do not degrade in 150 hours of testing. These results not only prove
that in operando methods can yield emergent nanomaterials, which in turn deliver 
exceptional performance, but also offer proof of concept that electrolysis and
fuel cells can be unified in a single, high-performance, versatile and easily
manufactured device. This opens up the possibility of simple, almost
instantaneous production of highly active nanostructures for reinvigorating SOCs 
during operation.

Remote observations of the asteroid (1) Ceres from ground- and space-based
telescopes have provided its approximate density and shape, leading to a range of
models for the interior of Ceres, from homogeneous to fully differentiated. A
previously missing parameter that can place a strong constraint on the interior
of Ceres is its moment of inertia, which requires the measurement of its
gravitational variation together with either precession rate or a validated
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, Earth-based remote observations
cannot measure gravity variations and the magnitude of the precession rate is too
small to be detected. Here we report gravity and shape measurements of Ceres
obtained from the Dawn spacecraft, showing that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium 
with its inferred normalized mean moment of inertia of 0.37. These data show that
Ceres is a partially differentiated body, with a rocky core overlaid by a
volatile-rich shell, as predicted in some studies. Furthermore, we show that the 
gravity signal is strongly suppressed compared to that predicted by the
topographic variation. This indicates that Ceres is isostatically compensated,
such that topographic highs are supported by displacement of a denser interior.
In contrast to the asteroid (4) Vesta, this strong compensation points to the
presence of a lower-viscosity layer at depth, probably reflecting a thermal
rather than compositional gradient. To further investigate the interior
structure, we assume a two-layer model for the interior of Ceres with a core
density of 2,460-2,900 kilograms per cubic metre (that is, composed of CI and CM 
chondrites), which yields an outer-shell thickness of 70-190 kilometres. The
density of this outer shell is 1,680-1,950 kilograms per cubic metre, indicating 
a mixture of volatiles and denser materials such as silicates and salts. Although
the gravity and shape data confirm that the interior of Ceres evolved thermally, 
its partially differentiated interior indicates an evolution more complex than
has been envisioned for mid-sized (less than 1,000 kilometres across) ice-rich
rocky bodies.

Only a handful of bird species are known to use foraging tools in the wild.
Amongst them, the New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) stands out with its
sophisticated tool-making skills. Despite considerable speculation, the
evolutionary origins of this species' remarkable tool behaviour remain largely
unknown, not least because no naturally tool-using congeners have yet been
identified that would enable informative comparisons. Here we show that another
tropical corvid, the 'Alalā (C. hawaiiensis; Hawaiian crow), is a highly
dexterous tool user. Although the 'Alalā became extinct in the wild in the early 
2000s, and currently survives only in captivity, at least two lines of evidence
suggest that tool use is part of the species' natural behavioural repertoire:
juveniles develop functional tool use without training, or social input from
adults; and proficient tool use is a species-wide capacity. 'Alalā and New
Caledonian crows evolved in similar environments on remote tropical islands, yet 
are only distantly related, suggesting that their technical abilities arose
convergently. This supports the idea that avian foraging tool use is facilitated 
by ecological conditions typical of islands, such as reduced competition for
embedded prey and low predation risk. Our discovery creates exciting
opportunities for comparative research on multiple tool-using and non-tool-using 
corvid species. Such work will in turn pave the way for replicated
cross-taxonomic comparisons with the primate lineage, enabling valuable insights 
into the evolutionary origins of tool-using behaviour.

The early evolution of planetesimals and planets can be constrained using
variations in the abundance of neodymium-142 ((142)Nd), which arise from the
initial distribution of (142)Nd within the protoplanetary disk and the
radioactive decay of the short-lived samarium-146 isotope ((146)Sm). The apparent
offset in (142)Nd abundance found previously between chondritic meteorites and
Earth has been interpreted either as a possible consequence of nucleosynthetic
variations within the protoplanetary disk or as a function of the differentiation
of Earth very early in its history. Here we report high-precision Sm and Nd
stable and radiogenic isotopic compositions of four calcium-aluminium-rich
refractory inclusions (CAIs) from three CV-type carbonaceous chondrites, and of
three whole-rock samples of unequilibrated enstatite chondrites. The CAIs, which 
are the first solids formed by condensation from the nebular gas, provide the
best constraints for the isotopic evolution of the early Solar System. Using the 
mineral isochron method for individual CAIs, we find that CAIs without isotopic
anomalies in Nd compared to the terrestrial composition share a
(146)Sm/(144)Sm-(142)Nd/(144)Nd isotopic evolution with Earth. The average
(142)Nd/(144)Nd composition for pristine enstatite chondrites that we calculate
coincides with that of the accessible silicate layers of Earth. This relationship
between CAIs, enstatite chondrites and Earth can only be a result of Earth having
inherited the same initial abundance of (142)Nd and chondritic proportions of Sm 
and Nd. Consequently, (142)Nd isotopic heterogeneities found in other CAIs and
among chondrite groups may arise from extrasolar grains that were present in the 
disk and incorporated in different proportions into these planetary objects. Our 
finding supports a chondritic Sm/Nd ratio for the bulk silicate Earth and, as a
consequence, chondritic abundances for other refractory elements. It also removes
the need for a hidden reservoir or for collisional erosion scenarios to explain
the (142)Nd/(144)Nd composition of Earth.

A long-standing paradigm assumes that the chemical and isotopic compositions of
many elements in the bulk silicate Earth are the same as in chondrites. However, 
the accessible Earth has a greater (142)Nd/(144)Nd ratio than do chondrites.
Because (142)Nd is the decay product of the now-extinct (146)Sm (which has a
half-life of 103 million years), this (142)Nd difference seems to require a
higher-than-chondritic Sm/Nd ratio for the accessible Earth. This must have been 
acquired during global silicate differentiation within the first 30 million years
of Solar System formation and implies the formation of a complementary
(142)Nd-depleted reservoir that either is hidden in the deep Earth, or lost to
space by impact erosion. Whether this complementary reservoir existed, and
whether or not it has been lost from Earth, is a matter of debate, and has
implications for determining the bulk composition of Earth, its heat content and 
structure, as well as for constraining the modes and timescales of its
geodynamical evolution. Here we show that, compared with chondrites, Earth's
precursor bodies were enriched in neodymium that was produced by the slow neutron
capture process (s-process) of nucleosynthesis. This s-process excess leads to
higher (142)Nd/(144)Nd ratios; after correction for this effect, the
(142)Nd/(144)Nd ratios of chondrites and the accessible Earth are
indistinguishable within five parts per million. The (142)Nd offset between the
accessible silicate Earth and chondrites therefore reflects a higher proportion
of s-process neodymium in the Earth, and not early differentiation processes. As 
such, our results obviate the need for hidden-reservoir or super-chondritic Earth
models and imply a chondritic Sm/Nd ratio for the bulk Earth. Although chondrites
formed at greater heliocentric distances and contain a different mix of presolar 
components than Earth, they nevertheless are suitable proxies for Earth's bulk
chemical composition.

Nanocrystalline metals, with a mean grain size of less than 100 nanometres, have 
greater room-temperature strength than their coarse-grained equivalents, in part 
owing to a large reduction in grain size. However, this high strength generally
comes with substantial losses in other mechanical properties, such as creep
resistance, which limits their practical utility; for example, creep rates in
nanocrystalline copper are about four orders of magnitude higher than those in
typical coarse-grained copper. The degradation of creep resistance in
nanocrystalline materials is in part due to an increase in the volume fraction of
grain boundaries, which lack long-range crystalline order and lead to processes
such as diffusional creep, sliding and rotation. Here we show that
nanocrystalline copper-tantalum alloys possess an unprecedented combination of
properties: high strength combined with extremely high-temperature creep
resistance, while maintaining mechanical and thermal stability. Precursory work
on this family of immiscible alloys has previously highlighted their
thermo-mechanical stability and strength, which has motivated their study under
more extreme conditions, such as creep. We find a steady-state creep rate of less
than 10(-6) per second-six to eight orders of magnitude lower than most
nanocrystalline metals-at various temperatures between 0.5 and 0.64 times the
melting temperature of the matrix (1,356 kelvin) under an applied stress ranging 
from 0.85 per cent to 1.2 per cent of the shear modulus. The unusual combination 
of properties in our nanocrystalline alloy is achieved via a processing route
that creates distinct nanoclusters of atoms that pin grain boundaries within the 
alloy. This pinning improves the kinetic stability of the grains by increasing
the energy barrier for grain-boundary sliding and rotation and by inhibiting
grain coarsening, under extremely long-term creep conditions. Our processing
approach should enable the development of microstructurally stable structural
alloys with high strength and creep resistance for various high-temperature
applications, including in the aerospace, naval, civilian infrastructure and
energy sectors.

Numerous biological processes are concurrently and coordinately active in every
living cell. Each of them encompasses synthetic, catalytic and regulatory
functions that are, almost always, carried out by proteins organized further into
higher-order structures and networks. For decades, the structures and functions
of selected proteins have been studied using biochemical and biophysical methods.
However, the properties and behaviour of the proteome as an integrated system
have largely remained elusive. Powerful mass-spectrometry-based technologies now 
provide unprecedented insights into the composition, structure, function and
control of the proteome, shedding light on complex biological processes and
phenotypes.

Knowledge of the three-dimensional structures of proteins and other biological
macromolecules often aids understanding of how they perform complicated tasks in 
the cell. Because many such tasks involve the cleavage or formation of chemical
bonds, structural characterization at the atomic level is most useful.
Developments in the electron microscopy of frozen hydrated samples (cryo-electron
microscopy) are providing unprecedented opportunities for the structural
characterization of biological macromolecules. This is resulting in a wave of
information about processes in the cell that were impossible to characterize with
existing techniques in structural biology.

The cellular proteome is a complex microcosm of structural and regulatory
networks that requires continuous surveillance and modification to meet the
dynamic needs of the cell. It is therefore crucial that the protein flux of the
cell remains in balance to ensure proper cell function. Genetic alterations that 
range from chromosome imbalance to oncogene activation can affect the speed,
fidelity and capacity of protein biogenesis and degradation systems, which often 
results in proteome imbalance. An improved understanding of the causes and
consequences of proteome imbalance is helping to reveal how these systems can be 
targeted to treat diseases such as cancer.

There are 20(200) possible amino-acid sequences for a 200-residue protein, of
which the natural evolutionary process has sampled only an infinitesimal subset. 
De novo protein design explores the full sequence space, guided by the physical
principles that underlie protein folding. Computational methodology has advanced 
to the point that a wide range of structures can be designed from scratch with
atomic-level accuracy. Almost all protein engineering so far has involved the
modification of naturally occurring proteins; it should now be possible to design
new functional proteins from the ground up to tackle current challenges in
biomedicine and nanotechnology.

The retention of episodic-like memory is enhanced, in humans and animals, when
something novel happens shortly before or after encoding. Using an everyday
memory task in mice, we sought the neurons mediating this dopamine-dependent
novelty effect, previously thought to originate exclusively from the
tyrosine-hydroxylase-expressing (TH+) neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Here
we report that neuronal firing in the locus coeruleus is especially sensitive to 
environmental novelty, locus coeruleus TH+ neurons project more profusely than
ventral tegmental area TH+ neurons to the hippocampus, optogenetic activation of 
locus coeruleus TH+ neurons mimics the novelty effect, and this
novelty-associated memory enhancement is unaffected by ventral tegmental area
inactivation. Surprisingly, two effects of locus coeruleus TH+ photoactivation
are sensitive to hippocampal D1/D5 receptor blockade and resistant to
adrenoceptor blockade: memory enhancement and long-lasting potentiation of
synaptic transmission in CA1 ex vivo. Thus, locus coeruleus TH+ neurons can
mediate post-encoding memory enhancement in a manner consistent with possible
co-release of dopamine in the hippocampus.

The transition from fish to tetrapod was arguably the most radical series of
adaptive shifts in vertebrate evolutionary history. Data are accumulating rapidly
for most aspects of these events, but the life histories of the earliest
tetrapods remain completely unknown, leaving a major gap in our understanding of 
these organisms as living animals. Symptomatic of this problem is the unspoken
assumption that the largest known Devonian tetrapod fossils represent adult
individuals. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, life history data for a
Devonian tetrapod, from the Acanthostega mass-death deposit of Stensiö Bjerg,
East Greenland. Using propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography
(PPC-SRμCT) to visualize the histology of humeri (upper arm bones) and infer
their growth histories, we show that even the largest individuals from this
deposit are juveniles. A long early juvenile stage with unossified limb bones,
during which individuals grew to almost final size, was followed by a
slow-growing late juvenile stage with ossified limbs that lasted for at least six
years in some individuals. The late onset of limb ossification suggests that the 
juveniles were exclusively aquatic, and the predominance of juveniles in the
sample suggests segregated distributions of juveniles and adults at least at
certain times. The absolute size at which limb ossification began differs greatly
between individuals, suggesting the possibility of sexual dimorphism, adaptive
strategies or competition-related size variation.

The long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) mediates the
transcriptional silencing of genes on the X chromosome. Here we show that, in
human cells, XIST is highly methylated with at least 78 N6-methyladenosine (m6A) 
residues-a reversible base modification of unknown function in long non-coding
RNAs. We show that m6A formation in XIST, as well as in cellular mRNAs, is
mediated by RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) and its paralogue RBM15B, which 
bind the m6A-methylation complex and recruit it to specific sites in RNA. This
results in the methylation of adenosine nucleotides in adjacent m6A consensus
motifs. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of RBM15 and RBM15B, or knockdown of 
methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), an m6A methyltransferase, impairs
XIST-mediated gene silencing. A systematic comparison of m6A-binding proteins
shows that YTH domain containing 1 (YTHDC1) preferentially recognizes m6A
residues on XIST and is required for XIST function. Additionally, artificial
tethering of YTHDC1 to XIST rescues XIST-mediated silencing upon loss of m6A.
These data reveal a pathway of m6A formation and recognition required for
XIST-mediated transcriptional repression.

Endothelin, a 21-amino-acid peptide, participates in various physiological
processes, such as regulation of vascular tone, humoral homeostasis, neural crest
cell development and neurotransmission. Endothelin and its G-protein-coupled
receptor are involved in the development of various diseases, such as pulmonary
arterial hypertension, and thus are important therapeutic targets. Here we report
crystal structures of human endothelin type B receptor in the ligand-free form
and in complex with the endogenous agonist endothelin-1. The structures and
mutation analysis reveal the mechanism for the isopeptide selectivity between
endothelin-1 and -3. Transmembrane helices 1, 2, 6 and 7 move and envelop the
entire endothelin peptide, in a virtually irreversible manner. The
agonist-induced conformational changes are propagated to the receptor core and
the cytoplasmic G-protein coupling interface, and probably induce conformational 
flexibility in TM6. A comparison with the M2 muscarinic receptor suggests a
shared mechanism for signal transduction in class A G-protein-coupled receptors.

    Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2017 Mar;30(2):179-180.

Melanoma is the deadliest form of commonly encountered skin cancer because of its
rapid progression towards metastasis. Although metabolic reprogramming is tightly
associated with tumour progression, the effect of metabolic regulatory circuits
on metastatic processes is poorly understood. PGC1α is a transcriptional
coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, protects against oxidative
stress and reprograms melanoma metabolism to influence drug sensitivity and
survival. Here, we provide data indicating that PGC1α suppresses melanoma
metastasis, acting through a pathway distinct from that of its bioenergetic
functions. Elevated PGC1α expression inversely correlates with vertical growth in
human melanoma specimens. PGC1α silencing makes poorly metastatic melanoma cells 
highly invasive and, conversely, PGC1α reconstitution suppresses metastasis.
Within populations of melanoma cells, there is a marked heterogeneity in PGC1α
levels, which predicts their inherent high or low metastatic capacity.
Mechanistically, PGC1α directly increases transcription of ID2, which in turn
binds to and inactivates the transcription factor TCF4. Inactive TCF4 causes
downregulation of metastasis-related genes, including integrins that are known to
influence invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of BRAFV600E using vemurafenib,
independently of its cytostatic effects, suppresses metastasis by acting on the
PGC1α-ID2-TCF4-integrin axis. Together, our findings reveal that PGC1α maintains 
mitochondrial energetic metabolism and suppresses metastasis through direct
regulation of parallel acting transcriptional programs. Consequently, components 
of these circuits define new therapeutic opportunities that may help to curb
melanoma metastasis.

Mice deficient in the DNA excision-repair gene Ercc1 (Ercc1∆/-) show numerous
accelerated ageing features that limit their lifespan to 4-6 months. They also
exhibit a 'survival response', which suppresses growth and enhances cellular
maintenance. Such a response resembles the anti-ageing response induced by
dietary restriction (also known as caloric restriction). Here we report that a
dietary restriction of 30% tripled the median and maximal remaining lifespans of 
these progeroid mice, strongly retarding numerous aspects of accelerated ageing. 
Mice undergoing dietary restriction retained 50% more neurons and maintained full
motor function far beyond the lifespan of mice fed ad libitum. Other
DNA-repair-deficient, progeroid Xpg-/- (also known as Ercc5-/-) mice, a model of 
Cockayne syndrome, responded similarly. The dietary restriction response in
Ercc1∆/- mice closely resembled the effects of dietary restriction in wild-type
animals. Notably, liver tissue from Ercc1∆/- mice fed ad libitum showed
preferential extinction of the expression of long genes, a phenomenon we also
observed in several tissues ageing normally. This is consistent with the
accumulation of stochastic, transcription-blocking lesions that affect long genes
more than short ones. Dietary restriction largely prevented this declining
transcriptional output and reduced the number of γH2AX DNA damage foci,
indicating that dietary restriction preserves genome function by alleviating DNA 
damage. Our findings establish the Ercc1∆/- mouse as a powerful model organism
for health-sustaining interventions, reveal potential for reducing endogenous DNA
damage, facilitate a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of dietary
restriction and suggest a role for counterintuitive dietary-restriction-like
therapy for human progeroid genome instability syndromes and possibly
neurodegeneration in general.

Chronic viral infections are characterized by a state of CD8+ T-cell dysfunction 
that is associated with expression of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
inhibitory receptor. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate CD8+ 
T-cell responses during chronic infection is required to improve immunotherapies 
that restore function in exhausted CD8+ T cells. Here we identify a population of
virus-specific CD8+ T cells that proliferate after blockade of the PD-1
inhibitory pathway in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (LCMV). These LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells expressed the PD-1 inhibitory
receptor, but also expressed several costimulatory molecules such as ICOS and
CD28. This CD8+ T-cell subset was characterized by a unique gene signature that
was related to that of CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells, CD8+ T cell memory
precursors and haematopoietic stem cell progenitors, but that was distinct from
that of CD4+ TH1 cells and CD8+ terminal effectors. This CD8+ T-cell population
was found only in lymphoid tissues and resided predominantly in the T-cell zones 
along with naive CD8+ T cells. These PD-1+CD8+ T cells resembled stem cells
during chronic LCMV infection, undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating
into the terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells that were present in both lymphoid and
non-lymphoid tissues. The proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade came almost
exclusively from this CD8+ T-cell subset. Notably, the transcription factor TCF1 
had a cell-intrinsic and essential role in the generation of this CD8+ T-cell
subset. These findings provide a better understanding of T-cell exhaustion and
have implications in the optimization of PD-1-directed immunotherapy in chronic
infections and cancer.

Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) is the 
first step in the synthesis of more complex carbon-based fuels and feedstocks
using renewable electricity. Unfortunately, the reaction suffers from slow
kinetics owing to the low local concentration of CO2 surrounding typical CO2
reduction reaction catalysts. Alkali metal cations are known to overcome this
limitation through non-covalent interactions with adsorbed reagent species, but
the effect is restricted by the solubility of relevant salts. Large applied
electrode potentials can also enhance CO2 adsorption, but this comes at the cost 
of increased hydrogen (H2) evolution. Here we report that nanostructured
electrodes produce, at low applied overpotentials, local high electric fields
that concentrate electrolyte cations, which in turn leads to a high local
concentration of CO2 close to the active CO2 reduction reaction surface.
Simulations reveal tenfold higher electric fields associated with metallic
nanometre-sized tips compared to quasi-planar electrode regions, and measurements
using gold nanoneedles confirm a field-induced reagent concentration that enables
the CO2 reduction reaction to proceed with a geometric current density for CO of 
22 milliamperes per square centimetre at -0.35 volts (overpotential of
0.24 volts). This performance surpasses by an order of magnitude the performance 
of the best gold nanorods, nanoparticles and oxide-derived noble metal catalysts.
Similarly designed palladium nanoneedle electrocatalysts produce formate with a
Faradaic efficiency of more than 90 per cent and an unprecedented geometric
current density for formate of 10 milliamperes per square centimetre at
-0.2 volts, demonstrating the wider applicability of the field-induced reagent
concentration concept.

Conjugate (or 1,4-) additions of carbanionic species to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl 
compounds are vital to research in organic and medicinal chemistry, and there are
several chiral catalysts that facilitate the catalytic enantioselective additions
of nucleophiles to enoates. Nonetheless, catalytic enantioselective 1,6-conjugate
additions are uncommon, and ones that incorporate readily functionalizable
moieties, such as propargyl or allyl groups, into acyclic α,β,γ,δ-doubly
unsaturated acceptors are unknown. Chemical transformations that could generate a
new bond at the C6 position of a dienoate are particularly desirable because the 
resulting products could then be subjected to further modifications. However,
such reactions, especially when dienoates contain two equally substituted
olefins, are scarce and are confined to reactions promoted by a phosphine-copper 
catalyst (with an alkyl Grignard reagent, dialkylzinc or trialkylaluminium
compounds), a diene-iridium catalyst (with arylboroxines), or a
bisphosphine-cobalt catalyst (with monosilyl-acetylenes). 1,6-Conjugate additions
are otherwise limited to substrates where there is full substitution at the C4
position. It is unclear why certain catalysts favour bond formation at C6,
and-although there are a small number of catalytic enantioselective conjugate
allyl additions-related 1,6-additions and processes involving a propargyl unit
are non-existent. Here we show that an easily accessible organocopper catalyst
can promote 1,6-conjugate additions of propargyl and 2-boryl-substituted allyl
groups to acyclic dienoates with high selectivity. A commercially available
allenyl-boron compound or a monosubstituted allene may be used. Products can be
obtained in up to 83 per cent yield, >98:2 diastereomeric ratio (for allyl
additions) and 99:1 enantiomeric ratio. We elucidate the mechanistic details,
including the origins of high site selectivity (1,6- versus 1,4-) and
enantioselectivity as a function of the catalyst structure and reaction type, by 
means of density functional theory calculations. The utility of the approach is
highlighted by an application towards enantioselective synthesis of the anti-HIV 
agent (-)-equisetin.

White dwarfs are compact stars, similar in size to Earth but approximately
200,000 times more massive. Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from
ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, but when in close orbits with less
dense stars, white dwarfs can strip material from their companions and the
resulting mass transfer can generate atomic line and X-ray emission, as well as
near- and mid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic. However, even in
binaries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio frequencies. 
Here we report the discovery of a white dwarf/cool star binary that emits from
X-ray to radio wavelengths. The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR Sco), was
classified in the early 1970s as a δ-Scuti star, a common variety of periodic
variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56-hour period close binary,
pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 minutes. The pulses are so intense that
AR Sco's optical flux can increase by a factor of four within 30 seconds, and
they are also detectable at radio frequencies. They reflect the spin of a
magnetic white dwarf, which we find to be slowing down on a 107-year timescale.
The spin-down power is an order of magnitude larger than that seen in
electromagnetic radiation, which, together with an absence of obvious signs of
accretion, suggests that AR Sco is primarily spin-powered. Although the
pulsations are driven by the white dwarf's spin, they mainly originate from the
cool star. AR Sco's broadband spectrum is characteristic of synchrotron
radiation, requiring relativistic electrons. These must either originate from
near the white dwarf or be generated in situ at the M star through direct
interaction with the white dwarf's magnetosphere.

Measurements and simulations have found that water moves through carbon nanotubes
at exceptionally high rates owing to nearly frictionless interfaces. These
observations have stimulated interest in nanotube-based membranes for
applications including desalination, nano-filtration and energy harvesting, yet
the exact mechanisms of water transport inside the nanotubes and at the
water-carbon interface continue to be debated because existing theories do not
provide a satisfactory explanation for the limited number of experimental results
available so far. This lack of experimental results arises because, even though
controlled and systematic studies have explored transport through individual
nanotubes, none has met the considerable technical challenge of unambiguously
measuring the permeability of a single nanotube. Here we show that the
pressure-driven flow rate through individual nanotubes can be determined with
unprecedented sensitivity and without dyes from the hydrodynamics of water jets
as they emerge from single nanotubes into a surrounding fluid. Our measurements
reveal unexpectedly large and radius-dependent surface slippage in carbon
nanotubes, and no slippage in boron nitride nanotubes that are
crystallographically similar to carbon nanotubes, but electronically different.
This pronounced contrast between the two systems must originate from subtle
differences in the atomic-scale details of their solid-liquid interfaces,
illustrating that nanofluidics is the frontier at which the continuum picture of 
fluid mechanics meets the atomic nature of matter.

The manipulation of small amounts of liquids has applications ranging from
biomedical devices to liquid transfer. Direct light-driven manipulation of
liquids, especially when triggered by light-induced capillary forces, is of
particular interest because light can provide contactless spatial and temporal
control. However, existing light-driven technologies suffer from an inherent
limitation in that liquid motion is strongly resisted by the effect of
contact-line pinning. Here we report a strategy to manipulate fluid slugs by
photo-induced asymmetric deformation of tubular microactuators, which induces
capillary forces for liquid propulsion. Microactuators with various shapes
(straight, 'Y'-shaped, serpentine and helical) are fabricated from a mechanically
robust linear liquid crystal polymer. These microactuators are able to exert
photocontrol of a wide diversity of liquids over a long distance with
controllable velocity and direction, and hence to mix multiphase liquids, to
combine liquids and even to make liquids run uphill. We anticipate that this
photodeformable microactuator will find use in micro-reactors, in
laboratory-on-a-chip settings and in micro-optomechanical systems.

The rules defining which small fraction of related DNA sequences can be
selectively bound by a transcription factor are poorly understood. One of the
most challenging tasks in DNA recognition is posed by dosage compensation systems
that require the distinction between sex chromosomes and autosomes. In Drosophila
melanogaster, the male-specific lethal dosage compensation complex (MSL-DCC)
doubles the level of transcription from the single male X chromosome, but the
nature of this selectivity is not known. Previous efforts to identify
X-chromosome-specific target sequences were unsuccessful as the identified MSL
recognition elements lacked discriminative power. Therefore, additional
determinants such as co-factors, chromatin features, RNA and chromosome
conformation have been proposed to refine targeting further. Here, using an in
vitro genome-wide DNA binding assay, we show that recognition of the X chromosome
is an intrinsic feature of the MSL-DCC. MSL2, the male-specific organizer of the 
complex, uses two distinct DNA interaction surfaces-the CXC and
proline/basic-residue-rich domains-to identify complex DNA elements on the X
chromosome. Specificity is provided by the CXC domain, which binds a novel motif 
defined by DNA sequence and shape. This motif characterizes a subclass of
MSL2-binding sites, which we name PionX (pioneering sites on the X) as they
appeared early during the recent evolution of an X chromosome in D. miranda and
are the first chromosomal sites to be bound during de novo MSL-DCC assembly. Our 
data provide the first, to our knowledge, documented molecular mechanism through 
which the dosage compensation machinery distinguishes the X chromosome from an
autosome. They highlight fundamental principles in the recognition of complex DNA
elements by protein that will have a strong impact on many aspects of chromosome 
biology.

The voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels convert membrane electrical signals to
intracellular Ca2+-mediated events. Among the ten subtypes of Cav channel in
mammals, Cav1.1 is specified for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal 
muscles. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the rabbit
Cav1.1 complex at a nominal resolution of 3.6 Å. The inner gate of the
ion-conducting α1-subunit is closed and all four voltage-sensing domains adopt an
'up' conformation, suggesting a potentially inactivated state. The extended
extracellular loops of the pore domain, which are stabilized by multiple
disulfide bonds, form a windowed dome above the selectivity filter. One side of
the dome provides the docking site for the α2δ-1-subunit, while the other side
may attract cations through its negative surface potential. The intracellular
I-II and III-IV linker helices interact with the β1a-subunit and the
carboxy-terminal domain of α1, respectively. Classification of the particles
yielded two additional reconstructions that reveal pronounced displacement of β1a
and adjacent elements in α1. The atomic model of the Cav1.1 complex establishes a
foundation for mechanistic understanding of excitation-contraction coupling and
provides a three-dimensional template for molecular interpretations of the
functions and disease mechanisms of Cav and Nav channels.

Chromosomes are carriers of genetic material and their accurate transfer from a
mother cell to its two daughters during cell division is of paramount importance 
for life. Kinetochores are crucial for this process, as they connect chromosomes 
with microtubules in the mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are multi-subunit
complexes that assemble on specialized chromatin domains, the centromeres, that
are able to enrich nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant centromeric
protein A (CENP-A). A group of several additional CENPs, collectively known as
constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN), establish the inner
kinetochore, whereas a ten-subunit assembly known as the KMN network creates a
microtubule-binding site in the outer kinetochore. Interactions between CENP-A
and two CCAN subunits, CENP-C and CENP-N, have been previously described, but a
comprehensive understanding of CCAN organization and of how it contributes to the
selective recognition of CENP-A has been missing. Here we use biochemical
reconstitution to unveil fundamental principles of kinetochore organization and
function. We show that cooperative interactions of a seven-subunit CCAN
subcomplex, the CHIKMLN complex, determine binding selectivity for CENP-A over
H3-nucleosomes. The CENP-A:CHIKMLN complex binds directly to the KMN network,
resulting in a 21-subunit complex that forms a minimal high-affinity linkage
between CENP-A nucleosomes and microtubules in vitro. This structural module is
related to fungal point kinetochores, which bind a single microtubule. Its
convolution with multiple CENP-A proteins may give rise to the regional
kinetochores of higher eukaryotes, which bind multiple microtubules. Biochemical 
reconstitution paves the way for mechanistic and quantitative analyses of
kinetochores.

Understanding the evolutionary transformation of fish fins into tetrapod limbs is
a fundamental problem in biology. The search for antecedents of tetrapod digits
in fish has remained controversial because the distal skeletons of limbs and fins
differ structurally, developmentally, and histologically. Moreover, comparisons
of fins with limbs have been limited by a relative paucity of data on the
cellular and molecular processes underlying the development of the fin skeleton. 
Here, we provide a functional analysis, using CRISPR/Cas9 and fate mapping, of 5'
hox genes and enhancers in zebrafish that are indispensable for the development
of the wrists and digits of tetrapods. We show that cells marked by the activity 
of an autopodial hoxa13 enhancer exclusively form elements of the fin fold,
including the osteoblasts of the dermal rays. In hox13 knockout fish, we find
that a marked reduction and loss of fin rays is associated with an increased
number of endochondral distal radials. These discoveries reveal a cellular and
genetic connection between the fin rays of fish and the digits of tetrapods and
suggest that digits originated via the transition of distal cellular fates.

Morphine is an alkaloid from the opium poppy used to treat pain. The potentially 
lethal side effects of morphine and related opioids-which include fatal
respiratory depression-are thought to be mediated by μ-opioid-receptor (μOR)
signalling through the β-arrestin pathway or by actions at other receptors.
Conversely, G-protein μOR signalling is thought to confer analgesia. Here we
computationally dock over 3 million molecules against the μOR structure and
identify new scaffolds unrelated to known opioids. Structure-based optimization
yields PZM21-a potent Gi activator with exceptional selectivity for μOR and
minimal β-arrestin-2 recruitment. Unlike morphine, PZM21 is more efficacious for 
the affective component of analgesia versus the reflexive component and is devoid
of both respiratory depression and morphine-like reinforcing activity in mice at 
equi-analgesic doses. PZM21 thus serves as both a probe to disentangle μOR
signalling and a therapeutic lead that is devoid of many of the side effects of
current opioids.

Neutrophils, eosinophils and 'classical' monocytes collectively account for about
70% of human blood leukocytes and are among the shortest-lived cells in the body.
Precise regulation of the lifespan of these myeloid cells is critical to maintain
protective immune responses and minimize the deleterious consequences of
prolonged inflammation. However, how the lifespan of these cells is strictly
controlled remains largely unknown. Here we identify a long non-coding RNA that
we termed Morrbid, which tightly controls the survival of neutrophils,
eosinophils and classical monocytes in response to pro-survival cytokines in
mice. To control the lifespan of these cells, Morrbid regulates the transcription
of the neighbouring pro-apoptotic gene, Bcl2l11 (also known as Bim), by promoting
the enrichment of the PRC2 complex at the Bcl2l11 promoter to maintain this gene 
in a poised state. Notably, Morrbid regulates this process in cis, enabling
allele-specific control of Bcl2l11 transcription. Thus, in these highly
inflammatory cells, changes in Morrbid levels provide a locus-specific regulatory
mechanism that allows rapid control of apoptosis in response to extracellular
pro-survival signals. As MORRBID is present in humans and dysregulated in
individuals with hypereosinophilic syndrome, this long non-coding RNA may
represent a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders characterized
by aberrant short-lived myeloid cell lifespan.

The Orion Bar is the archetypal edge-on molecular cloud surface illuminated by
strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. Our relative closeness to
the Orion nebula (about 1,350 light years away from Earth) means that we can
study the effects of stellar feedback on the parental cloud in detail.
Visible-light observations of the Orion Bar show that the transition between the 
hot ionized gas and the warm neutral atomic gas (the ionization front) is
spatially well separated from the transition between atomic and molecular gas
(the dissociation front), by about 15 arcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one
astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance). Static equilibrium models used to
interpret previous far-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the 
Orion Bar (typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous
cloud structure comprised of dense clumps embedded in a lower-density extended
gas component. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images
that allow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary
model predictions, there is no appreciable offset between the peak of the H2
vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of the
observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO transition 
zones are very close. We find a fragmented ridge of high-density substructures,
photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the molecular cloud surface. The
results suggest that the cloud edge has been compressed by a high-pressure wave
that is moving into the molecular cloud, demonstrating that dynamical and
non-equilibrium effects are important for the cloud evolution.

African climate is generally considered to have evolved towards progressively
drier conditions over the past few million years, with increased variability as
glacial-interglacial change intensified worldwide. Palaeoclimate records derived 
mainly from northern Africa exhibit a 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycle
overprinted on a pronounced 20,000-year (precession) beat, driven by orbital
forcing of summer insolation, global ice volume and long-lived atmospheric
greenhouse gases. Here we present a 1.3-million-year-long climate history from
the Lake Malawi basin (10°-14° S in eastern Africa), which displays strong
100,000-year (eccentricity) cycles of temperature and rainfall following the
Mid-Pleistocene Transition around 900,000 years ago. Interglacial periods were
relatively warm and moist, while ice ages were cool and dry. The Malawi record
shows limited evidence for precessional variability, which we attribute to the
opposing effects of austral summer insolation and the temporal/spatial pattern of
sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. The temperature history of the
Malawi basin, at least for the past 500,000 years, strongly resembles past
changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and terrigenous dust flux in the tropical
Pacific Ocean, but not in global ice volume. Climate in this sector of eastern
Africa (unlike northern Africa) evolved from a predominantly arid environment
with high-frequency variability to generally wetter conditions with more
prolonged wet and dry intervals.

Germinal centres (GCs) promote humoral immunity and vaccine efficacy. In GCs,
antigen-activated B cells proliferate, express high-affinity antibodies, promote 
antibody class switching, and yield B cell memory. Whereas the cytokine milieu
has long been known to regulate effector functions that include the choice of
immunoglobulin class, both cell-autonomous and extrinsic metabolic programming
have emerged as modulators of T-cell-mediated immunity. Here we show in mice that
GC light zones are hypoxic, and that low oxygen tension () alters B cell
physiology and function. In addition to reduced proliferation and increased B
cell death, low impairs antibody class switching to the pro-inflammatory IgG2c
antibody isotype by limiting the expression of activation-induced cytosine
deaminase (AID). Hypoxia induces HIF transcription factors by restricting the
activity of prolyl hydroxyl dioxygenase enzymes, which hydroxylate HIF-1α and
HIF-2α to destabilize HIF by binding the von Hippel-Landau tumour suppressor
protein (pVHL). B-cell-specific depletion of pVHL leads to constitutive HIF
stabilization, decreases antigen-specific GC B cells and undermines the
generation of high-affinity IgG, switching to IgG2c, early memory B cells, and
recall antibody responses. HIF induction can reprogram metabolic and growth
factor gene expression. Sustained hypoxia or HIF induction by pVHL deficiency
inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in B lymphoblasts, and
mTORC1-haploinsufficient B cells have reduced clonal expansion, AID expression,
and capacities to yield IgG2c and high-affinity antibodies. Thus, the normal
physiology of GCs involves regional variegation of hypoxia, and HIF-dependent
oxygen sensing regulates vital functions of B cells. We propose that the
restriction of oxygen in lymphoid organs, which can be altered in
pathophysiological states, modulates humoral immunity.

Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and sleeping sickness affect 20 million people
worldwide and lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually. The diseases are caused
by infection with the kinetoplastid parasites Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania spp. 
and Trypanosoma brucei spp., respectively. These parasites have similar biology
and genomic sequence, suggesting that all three diseases could be cured with
drugs that modulate the activity of a conserved parasite target. However, no such
molecular targets or broad spectrum drugs have been identified to date. Here we
describe a selective inhibitor of the kinetoplastid proteasome (GNF6702) with
unprecedented in vivo efficacy, which cleared parasites from mice in all three
models of infection. GNF6702 inhibits the kinetoplastid proteasome through a
non-competitive mechanism, does not inhibit the mammalian proteasome or growth of
mammalian cells, and is well-tolerated in mice. Our data provide genetic and
chemical validation of the parasite proteasome as a promising therapeutic target 
for treatment of kinetoplastid infections, and underscore the possibility of
developing a single class of drugs for these neglected diseases.

Molecular chaperones act on non-native proteins in the cell to prevent their
aggregation, premature folding or misfolding. Different chaperones often exert
distinct effects, such as acceleration or delay of folding, on client proteins
via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we report the solution structure 
of SecB, a chaperone that exhibits strong antifolding activity, in complex with
alkaline phosphatase and maltose-binding protein captured in their unfolded
states. SecB uses long hydrophobic grooves that run around its disk-like shape to
recognize and bind to multiple hydrophobic segments across the length of
non-native proteins. The multivalent binding mode results in proteins wrapping
around SecB. This unique complex architecture alters the kinetics of protein
binding to SecB and confers strong antifolding activity on the chaperone. The
data show how the different architectures of chaperones result in distinct
binding modes with non-native proteins that ultimately define the activity of the
chaperone.

Secondary metabolites synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases display
diverse and complex topologies and possess a range of biological activities. Much
of this diversity derives from a synthetic strategy that entails pre- and
post-assembly oxidation of both the chiral amino acid building blocks and the
assembled peptide scaffolds. The vancomycin biosynthetic pathway is an excellent 
example of the range of oxidative transformations that can be performed by the
iron-containing enzymes involved in its biosynthesis. However, because of the
challenges associated with using such oxidative enzymes to carry out chemical
transformations in vitro, chemical syntheses guided by these principles have not 
been fully realized in the laboratory. Here we report that two small-molecule
iron catalysts are capable of facilitating the targeted C-H oxidative
modification of amino acids and peptides with preservation of α-centre chirality.
Oxidation of proline to 5-hydroxyproline furnishes a versatile intermediate that 
can be transformed to rigid arylated derivatives or flexible linear carboxylic
acids, alcohols, olefins and amines in both monomer and peptide settings. The
value of this C-H oxidation strategy is demonstrated in its capacity for
generating diversity: four 'chiral pool' amino acids are transformed to
twenty-one chiral unnatural amino acids representing seven distinct functional

Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing proceeds by two consecutive
transesterification reactions via a lariat-intron intermediate. Here we present
the 3.8 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the spliceosome immediately after
lariat formation. The 5'-splice site is cleaved but remains close to the
catalytic Mg2+ site in the U2/U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) triplex, and the
5'-phosphate of the intron nucleotide G(+1) is linked to the branch adenosine
2'OH. The 5'-exon is held between the Prp8 amino-terminal and linker domains, and
base-pairs with U5 snRNA loop 1. Non-Watson-Crick interactions between the branch
helix and 5'-splice site dock the branch adenosine into the active site, while
intron nucleotides +3 to +6 base-pair with the U6 snRNA ACAGAGA sequence. Isy1
and the step-one factors Yju2 and Cwc25 stabilize docking of the branch helix.
The intron downstream of the branch site emerges between the Prp8 reverse
transcriptase and linker domains and extends towards the Prp16 helicase,
suggesting a plausible mechanism of remodelling before exon ligation.

Recent salinity changes in the Southern Ocean are among the most prominent
signals of climate change in the global ocean, yet their underlying causes have
not been firmly established. Here we propose that trends in the northward
transport of Antarctic sea ice are a major contributor to these changes. Using
satellite observations supplemented by sea-ice reconstructions, we estimate that 
wind-driven northward freshwater transport by sea ice increased by 20 ± 10 per
cent between 1982 and 2008. The strongest and most robust increase occurred in
the Pacific sector, coinciding with the largest observed salinity changes. We
estimate that the additional freshwater for the entire northern sea-ice edge
entails a freshening rate of -0.02 ± 0.01 grams per kilogram per decade in the
surface and intermediate waters of the open ocean, similar to the observed
freshening. The enhanced rejection of salt near the coast of Antarctica
associated with stronger sea-ice export counteracts the freshening of both
continental shelf and newly formed bottom waters due to increases in glacial
meltwater. Although the data sources underlying our results have substantial
uncertainties, regional analyses and independent data from an atmospheric
reanalysis support our conclusions. Our finding that northward sea-ice freshwater
transport is also a key determinant of the mean salinity distribution in the
Southern Ocean further underpins the importance of the sea-ice-induced freshwater
flux. Through its influence on the density structure of the ocean, this process
has critical consequences for the global climate by affecting the exchange of
heat, carbon and nutrients between the deep ocean and surface waters.

Comets are thought to preserve almost pristine dust particles, thus providing a
unique sample of the properties of the early solar nebula. The microscopic
properties of this dust played a key part in particle aggregation during the
formation of the Solar System. Cometary dust was previously considered to
comprise irregular, fluffy agglomerates on the basis of interpretations of remote
observations in the visible and infrared and the study of chondritic porous
interplanetary dust particles that were thought, but not proved, to originate in 
comets. Although the dust returned by an earlier mission has provided detailed
mineralogy of particles from comet 81P/Wild, the fine-grained aggregate component
was strongly modified during collection. Here we report in situ measurements of
dust particles at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The particles are aggregates
of smaller, elongated grains, with structures at distinct sizes indicating
hierarchical aggregation. Topographic images of selected dust particles with
sizes of one micrometre to a few tens of micrometres show a variety of
morphologies, including compact single grains and large porous aggregate
particles, similar to chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles. The
measured grain elongations are similar to the value inferred for interstellar
dust and support the idea that such grains could represent a fraction of the
building blocks of comets. In the subsequent growth phase, hierarchical
agglomeration could be a dominant process and would produce aggregates that stick
more easily at higher masses and velocities than homogeneous dust particles. The 
presence of hierarchical dust aggregates in the near-surface of the nucleus of
comet 67P also provides a mechanism for lowering the tensile strength of the dust
layer and aiding dust release.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and
neurodegeneration. Antibody-based immunotherapy against Aβ to trigger its
clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we
report the generation of aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively
targets aggregated Aβ. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, aducanumab is shown to 
enter the brain, bind parenchymal Aβ, and reduce soluble and insoluble Aβ in a
dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD, one year of monthly
intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain Aβ in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline
measured by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State
Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related
imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab
for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in
ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, it would provide compelling support for the
amyloid hypothesis.

Niche dimensionality provides a general theoretical explanation for
biodiversity-more niches, defined by more limiting factors, allow for more ways
that species can coexist. Because plant species compete for the same set of
limiting resources, theory predicts that addition of a limiting resource
eliminates potential trade-offs, reducing the number of species that can coexist.
Multiple nutrient limitation of plant production is common and therefore
fertilization may reduce diversity by reducing the number or dimensionality of
belowground limiting factors. At the same time, nutrient addition, by increasing 
biomass, should ultimately shift competition from belowground nutrients towards a
one-dimensional competitive trade-off for light. Here we show that plant species 
diversity decreased when a greater number of limiting nutrients were added across
45 grassland sites from a multi-continent experimental network. The number of
added nutrients predicted diversity loss, even after controlling for effects of
plant biomass, and even where biomass production was not nutrient-limited. We
found that elevated resource supply reduced niche dimensionality and diversity
and increased both productivity and compositional turnover. Our results point to 
the importance of understanding dimensionality in ecological systems that are
undergoing diversity loss in response to multiple global change factors.

Circulating tumour cells in women with advanced oestrogen-receptor
(ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast
cancer acquire a HER2-positive subpopulation after multiple courses of therapy.
In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to
HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity
during the evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown. Here we analyse
circulating tumour cells from 19 women with ER+/HER2- primary tumours, 84% of
whom had acquired circulating tumour cells expressing HER2. Cultured circulating 
tumour cells maintain discrete HER2+ and HER2- subpopulations: HER2+ circulating 
tumour cells are more proliferative but not addicted to HER2, consistent with
activation of multiple signalling pathways; HER2- circulating tumour cells show
activation of Notch and DNA damage pathways, exhibiting resistance to cytotoxic
chemotherapy, but sensitivity to Notch inhibition. HER2+ and HER2- circulating
tumour cells interconvert spontaneously, with cells of one phenotype producing
daughters of the opposite within four cell doublings. Although HER2+ and HER2-
circulating tumour cells have comparable tumour initiating potential,
differential proliferation favours the HER2+ state, while oxidative stress or
cytotoxic chemotherapy enhances transition to the HER2- phenotype. Simultaneous
treatment with paclitaxel and Notch inhibitors achieves sustained suppression of 
tumorigenesis in orthotopic circulating tumour cell-derived tumour models.
Together, these results point to distinct yet interconverting phenotypes within
patient-derived circulating tumour cells, contributing to progression of breast
cancer and acquisition of drug resistance.

Deregulation of the Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an
early event in many different cancers and a key driver of resistance to targeted 
therapies. Sustained signalling through this pathway is caused most often by
mutations in K-Ras, which biochemically favours the stabilization of active RAF
signalling complexes. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) is a MAPK scaffold that is
subject to allosteric regulation through dimerization with RAF. Direct targeting 
of KSR could have important therapeutic implications for cancer; however, testing
this hypothesis has been difficult owing to a lack of small-molecule antagonists 
of KSR function. Guided by KSR mutations that selectively suppress oncogenic, but
not wild-type, Ras signalling, we developed a class of compounds that stabilize a
previously unrecognized inactive state of KSR. These compounds, exemplified by
APS-2-79, modulate KSR-dependent MAPK signalling by antagonizing RAF
heterodimerization as well as the conformational changes required for
phosphorylation and activation of KSR-bound MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase). Furthermore, APS-2-79 increased the potency of several MEK inhibitors
specifically within Ras-mutant cell lines by antagonizing release of negative
feedback signalling, demonstrating the potential of targeting KSR to improve the 
efficacy of current MAPK inhibitors. These results reveal conformational
switching in KSR as a druggable regulator of oncogenic Ras, and further suggest
co-targeting of enzymatic and scaffolding activities within Ras-MAPK signalling
complexes as a therapeutic strategy for overcoming Ras-driven cancers.

Ca2+ antagonist drugs are widely used in therapy of cardiovascular disorders.
Three chemical classes of drugs bind to three separate, but allosterically
interacting, receptor sites on CaV1.2 channels, the most prominent voltage-gated 
Ca2+ (CaV) channel type in myocytes in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The
1,4-dihydropyridines are used primarily for treatment of hypertension and angina 
pectoris and are thought to act as allosteric modulators of voltage-dependent
Ca2+ channel activation, whereas phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines are used 
primarily for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and are thought to physically
block the pore. The structural basis for the different binding, action, and
therapeutic uses of these drugs remains unknown. Here we present crystallographic
and functional analyses of drug binding to the bacterial homotetrameric model CaV
channel CaVAb, which is inhibited by dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines with 
nanomolar affinity in a state-dependent manner. The binding site for amlodipine
and other dihydropyridines is located on the external, lipid-facing surface of
the pore module, positioned at the interface of two subunits. Dihydropyridine
binding allosterically induces an asymmetric conformation of the selectivity
filter, in which partially dehydrated Ca2+ interacts directly with one subunit
and blocks the pore. In contrast, the phenylalkylamine Br-verapamil binds in the 
central cavity of the pore on the intracellular side of the selectivity filter,
physically blocking the ion-conducting pathway. Structure-based mutations of key 
amino-acid residues confirm drug binding at both sites. Our results define the
structural basis for binding of dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines at their
distinct receptor sites on CaV channels and offer key insights into their
fundamental mechanisms of action and differential therapeutic uses in
cardiovascular diseases.

An early step in intracellular transport is the selective recognition of a
vesicle by its appropriate target membrane, a process regulated by Rab GTPases
via the recruitment of tethering effectors. Membrane tethering confers higher
selectivity and efficiency to membrane fusion than the pairing of SNAREs (soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) alone. Here we
address the mechanism whereby a tethered vesicle comes closer towards its target 
membrane for fusion by reconstituting an endosomal asymmetric tethering machinery
consisting of the dimeric coiled-coil protein EEA1 (refs 6, 7) recruited to
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate membranes and binding vesicles harbouring Rab5. 
Surprisingly, structural analysis reveals that Rab5:GTP induces an allosteric
conformational change in EEA1, from extended to flexible and collapsed. Through
dynamic analysis by optical tweezers, we confirm that EEA1 captures a vesicle at 
a distance corresponding to its extended conformation, and directly measure its
flexibility and the forces induced during the tethering reaction. Expression of
engineered EEA1 variants defective in the conformational change induce prominent 
clusters of tethered vesicles in vivo. Our results suggest a new mechanism in
which Rab5 induces a change in flexibility of EEA1, generating an entropic
collapse force that pulls the captured vesicle towards the target membrane to
initiate docking and fusion.

The epiblast (EPI) is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals, and of
pluripotent stem cells in vitro. To explore the ontogeny of human and primate
pluripotency, here we perform comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing for pre-
and post-implantation EPI development in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca
fascicularis). We show that after specification in the blastocysts, EPI from
cynomolgus monkeys (cyEPI) undergoes major transcriptome changes on implantation.
Thereafter, while generating gastrulating cells, cyEPI stably maintains its
transcriptome over a week, retains a unique set of pluripotency genes and
acquires properties for 'neuron differentiation'. Human and monkey pluripotent
stem cells show the highest similarity to post-implantation late cyEPI, which,
despite co-existing with gastrulating cells, bears characteristics of
pre-gastrulating mouse EPI and epiblast-like cells in vitro. These findings not
only reveal the divergence and coherence of EPI development, but also identify a 
developmental coordinate of the spectrum of pluripotency among key species,
providing a basis for better regulation of human pluripotency in vitro.

Serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) is a neurotransmitter that
has an essential role in the regulation of emotion. However, the precise circuits
have not yet been defined through which aversive states are orchestrated by 5-HT.
Here we show that 5-HT from the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HTDRN) enhances fear and 
anxiety and activates a subpopulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (CRFBNST) in mice.
Specifically, 5-HTDRN projections to the BNST, via actions at 5-HT2C receptors
(5-HT2CRs), engage a CRFBNST inhibitory microcircuit that silences anxiolytic
BNST outputs to the ventral tegmental area and lateral hypothalamus. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that this CRFBNST inhibitory circuit underlies aversive behaviour 
following acute exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This
early aversive effect is mediated via the corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 
receptor (CRF1R, also known as CRHR1), given that CRF1R antagonism is sufficient 
to prevent acute SSRI-induced enhancements in aversive learning. These results
reveal an essential 5-HTDRN→CRFBNST circuit governing fear and anxiety, and
provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the clinical observation of early
adverse events to SSRI treatment in some patients with anxiety disorders.

Hypermethylation of the promoters of tumour suppressor genes represses
transcription of these genes, conferring growth advantages to cancer cells. How
these changes arise is poorly understood. Here we show that the activity of
oxygen-dependent ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes is reduced by tumour
hypoxia in human and mouse cells. TET enzymes catalyse DNA demethylation through 
5-methylcytosine oxidation. This reduction in activity occurs independently of
hypoxia-associated alterations in TET expression, proliferation, metabolism,
hypoxia-inducible factor activity or reactive oxygen species, and depends
directly on oxygen shortage. Hypoxia-induced loss of TET activity increases
hypermethylation at gene promoters in vitro. In patients, tumour suppressor gene 
promoters are markedly more methylated in hypoxic tumour tissue, independent of
proliferation, stromal cell infiltration and tumour characteristics. Our data
suggest that up to half of hypermethylation events are due to hypoxia, with these
events conferring a selective advantage. Accordingly, increased hypoxia in mouse 
breast tumours increases hypermethylation, while restoration of tumour
oxygenation abrogates this effect. Tumour hypoxia therefore acts as a novel
regulator of DNA methylation.

During the Last Glacial Maximum, continental ice sheets isolated Beringia
(northeast Siberia and northwest North America) from unglaciated North America.
By around 15 to 14 thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal. kyr
bp), glacial retreat opened an approximately 1,500-km-long corridor between the
ice sheets. It remains unclear when plants and animals colonized this corridor
and it became biologically viable for human migration. We obtained radiocarbon
dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a
bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison 
and mammoth by approximately 12.6 cal. kyr bp, followed by open forest, with
evidence of moose and elk at about 11.5 cal. kyr bp, and boreal forest
approximately 10 cal. kyr bp. Our findings reveal that the first Americans,
whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6 cal.
kyr bp, are unlikely to have travelled by this route into the Americas. However, 
later groups may have used this north-south passageway.

Topological operations can achieve certain goals without requiring accurate
control over local operational details; for example, they have been used to
control geometric phases and have been proposed as a way of controlling the state
of certain systems within their degenerate subspaces. More recently, it was
predicted that topological operations can be used to transfer energy between
normal modes, provided that the system possesses a specific type of degeneracy
known as an exceptional point. Here we demonstrate the transfer of energy between
two vibrational modes of a cryogenic optomechanical device using topological
operations. We show that this transfer arises from the presence of an exceptional
point in the spectrum of the device. We also show that this transfer is
non-reciprocal. These results open up new directions in system control; they also
open up the possibility of exploring other dynamical effects related to
exceptional points, including the behaviour of thermal and quantum fluctuations
in their vicinity.

Physical systems with loss or gain have resonant modes that decay or grow
exponentially with time. Whenever two such modes coalesce both in their resonant 
frequency and their rate of decay or growth, an 'exceptional point' occurs,
giving rise to fascinating phenomena that defy our physical intuition.
Particularly intriguing behaviour is predicted to appear when an exceptional
point is encircled sufficiently slowly, such as a state-flip or the accumulation 
of a geometric phase. The topological structure of exceptional points has been
experimentally explored, but a full dynamical encircling of such a point and the 
associated breakdown of adiabaticity have remained out of reach of measurement.
Here we demonstrate that a dynamical encircling of an exceptional point is
analogous to the scattering through a two-mode waveguide with suitably designed
boundaries and losses. We present experimental results from a corresponding
waveguide structure that steers incoming waves around an exceptional point during
the transmission process. In this way, mode transitions are induced that
transform this device into a robust and asymmetric switch between different
waveguide modes. This work will enable the exploration of exceptional point
physics in system control and state transfer schemes at the crossroads between
fundamental research and practical applications.

Three Earth-sized exoplanets were recently discovered close to the habitable zone
of the nearby ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 (ref. 3). The nature of these
planets has yet to be determined, as their masses remain unmeasured and no
observational constraint is available for the planetary population surrounding
ultracool dwarfs, of which the TRAPPIST-1 planets are the first transiting
example. Theoretical predictions span the entire atmospheric range, from depleted
to extended hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. Here we report observations of the
combined transmission spectrum of the two inner planets during their simultaneous
transits on 4 May 2016. The lack of features in the combined spectrum rules out
cloud-free hydrogen-dominated atmospheres for each planet at ≥10σ levels;
TRAPPIST-1 b and c are therefore unlikely to have an extended gas envelope as
they occupy a region of parameter space in which high-altitude cloud/haze
formation is not expected to be significant for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.
Many denser atmospheres remain consistent with the featureless transmission
spectrum-from a cloud-free water-vapour atmosphere to a Venus-like one.

The use of femtosecond laser pulses allows precise and thermal-damage-free
removal of material (ablation) with wide-ranging scientific, medical and
industrial applications. However, its potential is limited by the low speeds at
which material can be removed and the complexity of the associated laser
technology. The complexity of the laser design arises from the need to overcome
the high pulse energy threshold for efficient ablation. However, the use of more 
powerful lasers to increase the ablation rate results in unwanted effects such as
shielding, saturation and collateral damage from heat accumulation at higher
laser powers. Here we circumvent this limitation by exploiting ablation cooling, 
in analogy to a technique routinely used in aerospace engineering. We apply
ultrafast successions (bursts) of laser pulses to ablate the target material
before the residual heat deposited by previous pulses diffuses away from the
processing region. Proof-of-principle experiments on various substrates
demonstrate that extremely high repetition rates, which make ablation cooling
possible, reduce the laser pulse energies needed for ablation and increase the
efficiency of the removal process by an order of magnitude over previously used
laser parameters. We also demonstrate the removal of brain tissue at two cubic
millimetres per minute and dentine at three cubic millimetres per minute without 
any thermal damage to the bulk.

Mutations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase cause
hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Fumarate hydratase-deficient
renal cancers are highly aggressive and metastasize even when small, leading to a
very poor clinical outcome. Fumarate, a small molecule metabolite that
accumulates in fumarate hydratase-deficient cells, plays a key role in cell
transformation, making it a bona fide oncometabolite. Fumarate has been shown to 
inhibit α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that are involved in DNA and
histone demethylation. However, the link between fumarate accumulation,
epigenetic changes, and tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that loss of
fumarate hydratase and the subsequent accumulation of fumarate in mouse and human
cells elicits an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a phenotypic switch 
associated with cancer initiation, invasion, and metastasis. We demonstrate that 
fumarate inhibits Tet-mediated demethylation of a regulatory region of the
antimetastatic miRNA cluster mir-200ba429, leading to the expression of
EMT-related transcription factors and enhanced migratory properties. These
epigenetic and phenotypic changes are recapitulated by the incubation of fumarate
hydratase-proficient cells with cell-permeable fumarate. Loss of fumarate
hydratase is associated with suppression of miR-200 and the EMT signature in
renal cancer and is associated with poor clinical outcome. These results imply
that loss of fumarate hydratase and fumarate accumulation contribute to the
aggressive features of fumarate hydratase-deficient tumours.

Soft robots possess many attributes that are difficult, if not impossible, to
achieve with conventional robots composed of rigid materials. Yet, despite recent
advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and 
power sources. New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft
analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full
potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of 
soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic that autonomously
regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board
monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates
fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation. The
body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft
lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel
reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned
within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique. The fluidic
and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of
magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale. Our integrated design and rapid 
fabrication approach enables the programmable assembly of multiple materials
within this architecture, laying the foundation for completely soft, autonomous
robots.

At a distance of 1.295 parsecs, the red dwarf Proxima Centauri (α Centauri C, GL 
551, HIP 70890 or simply Proxima) is the Sun's closest stellar neighbour and one 
of the best-studied low-mass stars. It has an effective temperature of only
around 3,050 kelvin, a luminosity of 0.15 per cent of that of the Sun, a measured
radius of 14 per cent of the radius of the Sun and a mass of about 12 per cent of
the mass of the Sun. Although Proxima is considered a moderately active star, its
rotation period is about 83 days (ref. 3) and its quiescent activity levels and
X-ray luminosity are comparable to those of the Sun. Here we report observations 
that reveal the presence of a small planet with a minimum mass of about 1.3 Earth
masses orbiting Proxima with a period of approximately 11.2 days at a
semi-major-axis distance of around 0.05 astronomical units. Its equilibrium
temperature is within the range where water could be liquid on its surface.

The evolution of industrial-era warming across the continents and oceans provides
a context for future climate change and is important for determining climate
sensitivity and the processes that control regional warming. Here we use post-ad 
1500 palaeoclimate records to show that sustained industrial-era warming of the
tropical oceans first developed during the mid-nineteenth century and was nearly 
synchronous with Northern Hemisphere continental warming. The early onset of
sustained, significant warming in palaeoclimate records and model simulations
suggests that greenhouse forcing of industrial-era warming commenced as early as 
the mid-nineteenth century and included an enhanced equatorial ocean response
mechanism. The development of Southern Hemisphere warming is delayed in
reconstructions, but this apparent delay is not reproduced in climate
simulations. Our findings imply that instrumental records are too short to
comprehensively assess anthropogenic climate change and that, in some regions,
about 180 years of industrial-era warming has already caused surface temperatures
to emerge above pre-industrial values, even when taking natural variability into 
account.

Many experiments have shown that loss of biodiversity reduces the capacity of
ecosystems to provide the multiple services on which humans depend. However,
experiments necessarily simplify the complexity of natural ecosystems and will
normally control for other important drivers of ecosystem functioning, such as
the environment or land use. In addition, existing studies typically focus on the
diversity of single trophic groups, neglecting the fact that biodiversity loss
occurs across many taxa and that the functional effects of any trophic group may 
depend on the abundance and diversity of others. Here we report analysis of the
relationships between the species richness and abundance of nine trophic groups, 
including 4,600 above- and below-ground taxa, and 14 ecosystem services and
functions and with their simultaneous provision (or multifunctionality) in 150
grasslands. We show that high species richness in multiple trophic groups
(multitrophic richness) had stronger positive effects on ecosystem services than 
richness in any individual trophic group; this includes plant species richness,
the most widely used measure of biodiversity. On average, three trophic groups
influenced each ecosystem service, with each trophic group influencing at least
one service. Multitrophic richness was particularly beneficial for 'regulating'
and 'cultural' services, and for multifunctionality, whereas a change in the
total abundance of species or biomass in multiple trophic groups (the
multitrophic abundance) positively affected supporting services. Multitrophic
richness and abundance drove ecosystem functioning as strongly as abiotic
conditions and land-use intensity, extending previous experimental results to
real-world ecosystems. Primary producers, herbivorous insects and microbial
decomposers seem to be particularly important drivers of ecosystem functioning,
as shown by the strong and frequent positive associations of their richness or
abundance with multiple ecosystem services. Our results show that multitrophic
richness and abundance support ecosystem functioning, and demonstrate that a
focus on single groups has led to researchers to greatly underestimate the
functional importance of biodiversity.

The TRPM2 ion channel is required for sensitivity to warmth.

Tan CH, McNaughton PA.

Thermally activated ion channels are known to detect the entire thermal range
from extreme heat (TRPV2), painful heat (TRPV1, TRPM3 and ANO1), non-painful
warmth (TRPV3 and TRPV4) and non-painful coolness (TRPM8) through to painful cold
(TRPA1). Genetic deletion of each of these ion channels, however, has only modest
effects on thermal behaviour in mice, with the exception of TRPM8, the deletion
of which has marked effects on the perception of moderate coolness in the range
10-25 °C. The molecular mechanism responsible for detecting non-painful warmth,
in particular, is unresolved. Here we used calcium imaging to identify a
population of thermally sensitive somatosensory neurons which do not express any 
of the known thermally activated TRP channels. We then used a combination of
calcium imaging, electrophysiology and RNA sequencing to show that the ion
channel generating heat sensitivity in these neurons is TRPM2. Autonomic neurons,
usually thought of as exclusively motor, also express TRPM2 and respond directly 
to heat. Mice in which TRPM2 had been genetically deleted showed a striking
deficit in their sensation of non-noxious warm temperatures, consistent with the 
idea that TRPM2 initiates a 'warm' signal which drives cool-seeking behaviour.

Uncovering Earth's virome.

Mikhailova N, Rubin E, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, but challenges in
detecting, isolating, and classifying unknown viruses have prevented exhaustive
surveys of the global virome. Here we analysed over 5 Tb of metagenomic sequence 
data from 3,042 geographically diverse samples to assess the global distribution,
phylogenetic diversity, and host specificity of viruses. We discovered over
125,000 partial DNA viral genomes, including the largest phage yet identified,
and increased the number of known viral genes by 16-fold. Half of the predicted
partial viral genomes were clustered into genetically distinct groups, most of
which included genes unrelated to those in known viruses. Using CRISPR spacers
and transfer RNA matches to link viral groups to microbial host(s), we doubled
the number of microbial phyla known to be infected by viruses, and identified
viruses that can infect organisms from different phyla. Analysis of viral
distribution across diverse ecosystems revealed strong habitat-type specificity
for the vast majority of viruses, but also identified some cosmopolitan groups.
Our results highlight an extensive global viral diversity and provide detailed
insight into viral habitat distribution and host–virus interactions.

Diverse activation pathways in class A GPCRs converge near the G-protein-coupling
region.

Venkatakrishnan AJ, Deupi X, Lebon G, Heydenreich FM, Flock T, Miljus T, Balaji
S, Bouvier M, Veprintsev DB, Tate CG, Schertler GF, Babu MM.

Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of membrane
proteins that mediate a wide variety of physiological functions, including
vision, neurotransmission and immune responses. They are the targets of nearly
one-third of all prescribed medicinal drugs such as beta blockers and
antipsychotics. GPCR activation is facilitated by extracellular ligands and leads
to the recruitment of intracellular G proteins. Structural rearrangements of
residue contacts in the transmembrane domain serve as 'activation pathways' that 
connect the ligand-binding pocket to the G-protein-coupling region within the
receptor. In order to investigate the similarities in activation pathways across 
class A GPCRs, we analysed 27 GPCRs from diverse subgroups for which structures
of active, inactive or both states were available. Here we show that, despite the
diversity in activation pathways between receptors, the pathways converge near
the G-protein-coupling region. This convergence is mediated by a highly conserved
structural rearrangement of residue contacts between transmembrane helices 3, 6
and 7 that releases G-protein-contacting residues. The convergence of activation 
pathways may explain how the activation steps initiated by diverse ligands enable
GPCRs to bind a common repertoire of G proteins.

In the dividing eukaryotic cell, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures
that each daughter cell inherits an identical set of chromosomes. The SAC
coordinates the correct attachment of sister chromatid kinetochores to the
mitotic spindle with activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), the E3
ubiquitin ligase responsible for initiating chromosome separation. In response to
unattached kinetochores, the SAC generates the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), 
which inhibits the APC/C and delays chromosome segregation. By cryo-electron
microscopy, here we determine the near-atomic resolution structure of a human
APC/C–MCC complex (APC/C(MCC)). Degron-like sequences of the MCC subunit BubR1
block degron recognition sites on Cdc20, the APC/C coactivator subunit
responsible for substrate interactions. BubR1 also obstructs binding of the
initiating E2 enzyme UbcH10 to repress APC/C ubiquitination activity.
Conformational variability of the complex enables UbcH10 association, and
structural analysis shows how the Cdc20 subunit intrinsic to the MCC (Cdc20(MCC))
is ubiquitinated, a process that results in APC/C reactivation when the SAC is
silenced.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease characterized by
an intense fibrotic stromal response and deregulated metabolism. The role of the 
stroma in PDAC biology is complex and it has been shown to play critical roles
that differ depending on the biological context. The stromal reaction also
impairs the vasculature, leading to a highly hypoxic, nutrient-poor environment. 
As such, these tumours must alter how they capture and use nutrients to support
their metabolic needs. Here we show that stroma-associated pancreatic stellate
cells (PSCs) are critical for PDAC metabolism through the secretion of
non-essential amino acids (NEAA). Specifically, we uncover a previously
undescribed role for alanine, which outcompetes glucose and glutamine-derived
carbon in PDAC to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and thus NEAA and
lipid biosynthesis. This shift in fuel source decreases the tumour’s dependence
on glucose and serum-derived nutrients, which are limited in the pancreatic
tumour microenvironment. Moreover, we demonstrate that alanine secretion by PSCs 
is dependent on PSC autophagy, a process that is stimulated by cancer cells.
Thus, our results demonstrate a novel metabolic interaction between PSCs and
cancer cells, in which PSC-derived alanine acts as an alternative carbon source. 
This finding highlights a previously unappreciated metabolic network within
pancreatic tumours in which diverse fuel sources are used to promote growth in an
austere tumour microenvironment.

The prion protein is an agonistic ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor
Adgrg6.

Ablation of the cellular prion protein PrP(C) leads to a chronic demyelinating
polyneuropathy affecting Schwann cells. Neuron-restricted expression of PrP(C)
prevents the disease, suggesting that PrP(C) acts in trans through an
unidentified Schwann cell receptor. Here we show that the cAMP concentration in
sciatic nerves from PrP(C)-deficient mice is reduced, suggesting that PrP(C) acts
via a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The amino-terminal flexible tail
(residues 23-120) of PrP(C) triggered a concentration-dependent increase in cAMP 
in primary Schwann cells, in the Schwann cell line SW10, and in HEK293T cells
overexpressing the GPCR Adgrg6 (also known as Gpr126). By contrast, naive HEK293T
cells and HEK293T cells expressing several other GPCRs did not react to the
flexible tail, and ablation of Gpr126 from SW10 cells abolished the flexible
tail-induced cAMP response. The flexible tail contains a polycationic cluster
(KKRPKPG) similar to the GPRGKPG motif of the Gpr126 agonist type-IV collagen. A 
KKRPKPG-containing PrPC-derived peptide (FT(23-50)) sufficed to induce a
Gpr126-dependent cAMP response in cells and mice, and improved myelination in
hypomorphic gpr126 mutant zebrafish (Danio rerio). Substitution of the cationic
residues with alanines abolished the biological activity of both FT(23-50) and
the equivalent type-IV collagen peptide. We conclude that PrP(C) promotes myelin 
homeostasis through flexible tail-mediated Gpr126 agonism. As well as clarifying 
the physiological role of PrP(C), these observations are relevant to the
pathogenesis of demyelinating polyneuropathies--common debilitating diseases for 
which there are limited therapeutic options.

Molecular modifiers reveal a mechanism of pathological crystal growth inhibition.

Chung J, Granja I, Taylor MG, Mpourmpakis G, Asplin JR, Rimer JD.

Crystalline materials are crucial to the function of living organisms, in the
shells of molluscs, the matrix of bone, the teeth of sea urchins, and the
exoskeletons of coccoliths. However, pathological biomineralization can be an
undesirable crystallization process associated with human diseases. The crystal
growth of biogenic, natural and synthetic materials may be regulated by the
action of modifiers, most commonly inhibitors, which range from small ions and
molecules to large macromolecules. Inhibitors adsorb on crystal surfaces and
impede the addition of solute, thereby reducing the rate of growth. Complex
inhibitor-crystal interactions in biomineralization are often not well
elucidated. Here we show that two molecular inhibitors of calcium oxalate
monohydrate crystallization--citrate and hydroxycitrate--exhibit a mechanism that
differs from classical theory in that inhibitor adsorption on crystal surfaces
induces dissolution of the crystal under specific conditions rather than a
reduced rate of crystal growth. This phenomenon occurs even in supersaturated
solutions where inhibitor concentration is three orders of magnitude less than
that of the solute. The results of bulk crystallization, in situ atomic force
microscopy, and density functional theory studies are qualitatively consistent
with a hypothesis that inhibitor-crystal interactions impart localized strain to 
the crystal lattice and that oxalate and calcium ions are released into solution 
to alleviate this strain. Calcium oxalate monohydrate is the principal component 
of human kidney stones and citrate is an often-used therapy, but hydroxycitrate
is not. For hydroxycitrate to function as a kidney stone treatment, it must be
excreted in urine. We report that hydroxycitrate ingested by non-stone-forming
humans at an often-recommended dose leads to substantial urinary excretion. In
vitro assays using human urine reveal that the molecular modifier hydroxycitrate 
is as effective an inhibitor of nucleation of calcium oxalate monohydrate
nucleation as is citrate. Our findings support exploration of the clinical
potential of hydroxycitrate as an alternative treatment to citrate for kidney
stones.

Classical hormone receptors reversibly and non-covalently bind active hormone
molecules, which are generated by biosynthetic enzymes, to trigger signal
transduction. The α/β hydrolase DWARF14 (D14), which hydrolyses the plant
branching hormone strigolactone and interacts with the F-box protein D3/MAX2, is 
probably involved in strigolactone detection. However, the active form of
strigolactone has yet to be identified and it is unclear which protein directly
binds the active form of strigolactone, and in which manner, to act as the
genuine strigolactone receptor. Here we report the crystal structure of the
strigolactone-induced AtD14-D3-ASK1 complex, reveal that Arabidopsis thaliana
(At)D14 undergoes an open-to-closed state transition to trigger strigolactone
signalling, and demonstrate that strigolactone is hydrolysed into a covalently
linked intermediate molecule (CLIM) to initiate a conformational change of AtD14 
to facilitate interaction with D3. Notably, analyses of a highly branched
Arabidopsis mutant d14-5 show that the AtD14(G158E) mutant maintains enzyme
activity to hydrolyse strigolactone, but fails to efficiently interact with
D3/MAX2 and loses the ability to act as a receptor that triggers strigolactone
signalling in planta. These findings uncover a mechanism underlying the
allosteric activation of AtD14 by strigolactone hydrolysis into CLIM, and define 
AtD14 as a non-canonical hormone receptor with dual functions to generate and
sense the active form of strigolactone.

We report genome-wide ancient DNA from 44 ancient Near Easterners ranging in time
between ~12,000 and 1,400 bc, from Natufian hunter-gatherers to Bronze Age
farmers. We show that the earliest populations of the Near East derived around
half their ancestry from a 'Basal Eurasian' lineage that had little if any
Neanderthal admixture and that separated from other non-African lineages before
their separation from each other. The first farmers of the southern Levant
(Israel and Jordan) and Zagros Mountains (Iran) were strongly genetically
differentiated, and each descended from local hunter-gatherers. By the time of
the Bronze Age, these two populations and Anatolian-related farmers had mixed
with each other and with the hunter-gatherers of Europe to greatly reduce genetic
differentiation. The impact of the Near Eastern farmers extended beyond the Near 
East: farmers related to those of Anatolia spread westward into Europe; farmers
related to those of the Levant spread southward into East Africa; farmers related
to those of Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to
both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe
spread eastward into South Asia.

Extending the lifetime of a quantum bit with error correction in superconducting 
circuits.

L, Girvin SM, Jiang L, Mirrahimi M, Devoret MH, Schoelkopf RJ.

Quantum error correction (QEC) can overcome the errors experienced by qubits and 
is therefore an essential component of a future quantum computer. To implement
QEC, a qubit is redundantly encoded in a higher-dimensional space using quantum
states with carefully tailored symmetry properties. Projective measurements of
these parity-type observables provide error syndrome information, with which
errors can be corrected via simple operations. The 'break-even' point of QEC--at 
which the lifetime of a qubit exceeds the lifetime of the constituents of the
system--has so far remained out of reach. Although previous works have
demonstrated elements of QEC, they primarily illustrate the signatures or scaling
properties of QEC codes rather than test the capacity of the system to preserve a
qubit over time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even
point by suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically 
encoded in superpositions of Schrödinger-cat states of a superconducting
resonator. We implement a full QEC protocol by using real-time feedback to
encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode and correct. As measured by
full process tomography, without any post-selection, the corrected qubit lifetime
is 320 microseconds, which is longer than the lifetime of any of the parts of the
system: 20 times longer than the lifetime of the transmon, about 2.2 times longer
than the lifetime of an uncorrected logical encoding and about 1.1 longer than
the lifetime of the best physical qubit (the |0〉f and |1〉f Fock states of the
resonator). Our results illustrate the benefit of using hardware-efficient qubit 
encodings rather than traditional QEC schemes. Furthermore, they advance the
field of experimental error correction from confirming basic concepts to
exploring the metrics that drive system performance and the challenges in
realizing a fault-tolerant system.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is responsible for the current epidemic in
Brazil and the Americas. ZIKV has been causally associated with fetal
microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, and other birth defects in both
humans and mice. The rapid development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is a 
global health priority, but very little is currently known about ZIKV immunology 
and mechanisms of immune protection. Here we show that a single immunization with
a plasmid DNA vaccine or a purified inactivated virus vaccine provides complete
protection in susceptible mice against challenge with a strain of ZIKV involved
in the outbreak in northeast Brazil. This ZIKV strain has recently been shown to 
cross the placenta and to induce fetal microcephaly and other congenital
malformations in mice. We produced DNA vaccines expressing ZIKV pre-membrane and 
envelope (prM-Env), as well as a series of deletion mutants. The prM-Env DNA
vaccine, but not the deletion mutants, afforded complete protection against ZIKV,
as measured by absence of detectable viraemia following challenge, and protective
efficacy correlated with Env-specific antibody titers. Adoptive transfer of
purified IgG from vaccinated mice conferred passive protection, and depletion of 
CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes in vaccinated mice did not abrogate this protection.
These data demonstrate that protection against ZIKV challenge can be achieved by 
single-shot subunit and inactivated virus vaccines in mice and that Env-specific 
antibody titers represent key immunologic correlates of protection. Our findings 
suggest that the development of a ZIKV vaccine for humans is likely to be
achievable.

In the past 50 years, cross-coupling reactions mediated by transition metals have
changed the way in which complex organic molecules are synthesized. The
predictable and chemoselective nature of these transformations has led to their
widespread adoption across many areas of chemical research. However, the
construction of a bond between two sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms, a fundamental
unit of organic chemistry, remains an important yet elusive objective for
engineering cross-coupling reactions. In comparison to related procedures with
sp(2)-hybridized species, the development of methods for sp(3)-sp(3) bond
formation via transition metal catalysis has been hampered historically by
deleterious side-reactions, such as β-hydride elimination with palladium
catalysis or the reluctance of alkyl halides to undergo oxidative addition. To
address this issue, nickel-catalysed cross-coupling processes can be used to form
sp(3)-sp(3) bonds that utilize organometallic nucleophiles and alkyl
electrophiles. In particular, the coupling of alkyl halides with pre-generated
organozinc, Grignard and organoborane species has been used to furnish diverse
molecular structures. However, the manipulations required to produce these
activated structures is inefficient, leading to poor step- and atom-economies.
Moreover, the operational difficulties associated with making and using these
reactive coupling partners, and preserving them through a synthetic sequence, has
hindered their widespread adoption. A generically useful sp(3)-sp(3) coupling
technology that uses bench-stable, native organic functional groups, without the 
need for pre-functionalization or substrate derivatization, would therefore be
valuable. Here we demonstrate that the synergistic merger of photoredox and
nickel catalysis enables the direct formation of sp(3)-sp(3) bonds using only
simple carboxylic acids and alkyl halides as the nucleophilic and electrophilic
coupling partners, respectively. This metallaphotoredox protocol is suitable for 
many primary and secondary carboxylic acids. The merit of this coupling strategy 
is illustrated by the synthesis of the pharmaceutical tirofiban in four steps
from commercially available starting materials.

An efficient catalytic process for converting methane into methanol could have
far-reaching economic implications. Iron-containing zeolites (microporous
aluminosilicate minerals) are noteworthy in this regard, having an outstanding
ability to hydroxylate methane rapidly at room temperature to form methanol.
Reactivity occurs at an extra-lattice active site called α-Fe(ii), which is
activated by nitrous oxide to form the reactive intermediate α-O; however,
despite nearly three decades of research, the nature of the active site and the
factors determining its exceptional reactivity are unclear. The main difficulty
is that the reactive species-α-Fe(ii) and α-O-are challenging to probe
spectroscopically: data from bulk techniques such as X-ray absorption
spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility are complicated by contributions from
inactive 'spectator' iron. Here we show that a site-selective spectroscopic
method regularly used in bioinorganic chemistry can overcome this problem.
Magnetic circular dichroism reveals α-Fe(ii) to be a mononuclear, high-spin,
square planar Fe(ii) site, while the reactive intermediate, α-O, is a
mononuclear, high-spin Fe(iv)=O species, whose exceptional reactivity derives
from a constrained coordination geometry enforced by the zeolite lattice. These
findings illustrate the value of our approach to exploring active sites in
heterogeneous systems. The results also suggest that using matrix constraints to 
activate metal sites for function-producing what is known in the context of
metalloenzymes as an 'entatic' state-might be a useful way to tune the activity
of heterogeneous catalysts.

The physics of underdoped copper oxide superconductors, including the pseudogap, 
spin and charge ordering and their relation to superconductivity, is intensely
debated. The overdoped copper oxides are perceived as simpler, with strongly
correlated fermion physics evolving smoothly into the conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer behaviour. Pioneering studies on a few overdoped
samples indicated that the superfluid density was much lower than expected, but
this was attributed to pair-breaking, disorder and phase separation. Here we
report the way in which the magnetic penetration depth and the phase stiffness
depend on temperature and doping by investigating the entire overdoped side of
the La2-xSrxCuO4 phase diagram. We measured the absolute values of the magnetic
penetration depth and the phase stiffness to an accuracy of one per cent in
thousands of samples; the large statistics reveal clear trends and intrinsic
properties. The films are homogeneous; variations in the critical superconducting
temperature within a film are very small (less than one kelvin). At every level
of doping the phase stiffness decreases linearly with temperature. The dependence
of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting
temperature is generally linear, but with an offset; however, close to the origin
this dependence becomes parabolic. This scaling law is incompatible with the
standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description.

Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for the
medical and functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we describe
the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA
sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of
the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic
diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and 
provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We
have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for
sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against
various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion
of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72% of these genes having no
currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these
data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing
variants, and for the discovery of human 'knockout' variants in protein-coding
genes.

Capturing a substrate in an activated RING E3/E2-SUMO complex.

Streich FC Jr, Lima CD.

Post-translational protein modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like
(Ubl) proteins such as small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) regulates processes
including protein homeostasis, the DNA damage response, and the cell cycle.
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is modified by Ub or poly-Ub at lysine 
(Lys)164 after DNA damage to recruit repair factors. Yeast PCNA is modified by
SUMO on Lys164 and Lys127 during S-phase to recruit the anti-recombinogenic
helicase Srs2. Lys164 modification requires specialized E2/E3 enzyme pairs for
SUMO or Ub conjugation. For SUMO, Lys164 modification is strictly dependent on
the E3 ligase Siz1, suggesting the E3 alters E2 specificity to promote Lys164
modification. The structural basis for substrate interactions in activated
E3/E2–Ub/Ubl complexes remains unclear. Here we report an engineered E2 protein
and cross-linking strategies that trap an E3/E2–Ubl/substrate complex for
structure determination, illustrating how an E3 can bypass E2 specificity to
force-feed a substrate lysine into the E2 active site.

HIV-1 uses dynamic capsid pores to import nucleotides and fuel encapsidated DNA
synthesis.

Jacques DA, McEwan WA, Hilditch L, Price AJ, Towers GJ, James LC.

During the early stages of infection, the HIV-1 capsid protects viral components 
from cytosolic sensors and nucleases such as cGAS and TREX, respectively, while
allowing access to nucleotides for efficient reverse transcription. Here we show 
that each capsid hexamer has a size-selective pore bound by a ring of six
arginine residues and a 'molecular iris' formed by the amino-terminal β-hairpin. 
The arginine ring creates a strongly positively charged channel that recruits the
four nucleotides with on-rates that approach diffusion limits. Progressive
removal of pore arginines results in a dose-dependent and concomitant decrease in
nucleotide affinity, reverse transcription and infectivity. This positively
charged channel is universally conserved in lentiviral capsids despite the fact
that it is strongly destabilizing without nucleotides to counteract charge
repulsion. We also describe a channel inhibitor, hexacarboxybenzene, which
competes for nucleotide binding and efficiently blocks encapsidated reverse
transcription, demonstrating the tractability of the pore as a novel drug target.

Natural courtship song variation caused by an intronic retroelement in an ion
channel gene.

Ding Y, Berrocal A, Morita T, Longden KD, Stern DL.

Animal species display enormous variation for innate behaviours, but little is
known about how this diversity arose. Here, using an unbiased genetic approach,
we map a courtship song difference between wild isolates of Drosophila simulans
and Drosophila mauritiana to a 966 base pair region within the slowpoke (slo)
locus, which encodes a calcium-activated potassium channel. Using the reciprocal 
hemizygosity test, we confirm that slo is the causal locus and resolve the causal
mutation to the evolutionarily recent insertion of a retroelement in a slo intron
within D. simulans. Targeted deletion of this retroelement reverts the song
phenotype and alters slo splicing. Like many ion channel genes, slo is expressed 
widely in the nervous system and influences a variety of behaviours; slo-null
males sing little song with severely disrupted features. By contrast, the natural
variant of slo alters a specific component of courtship song, illustrating that
regulatory evolution of a highly pleiotropic ion channel gene can cause modular
changes in behaviour.

Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), one of the largest membrane-bound
enzymes in the cell, powers ATP synthesis in mammalian mitochondria by using the 
reducing potential of NADH to drive protons across the inner mitochondrial
membrane. Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core
subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to
humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge
of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary.
Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy
structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45
subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire
structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles
identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements,
which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions 
of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our
structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly
and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I
dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the
supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation
of catalysis.

Williams syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by an
uncommon hypersociability and a mosaic of retained and compromised linguistic and
cognitive abilities. Nearly all clinically diagnosed individuals with Williams
syndrome lack precisely the same set of genes, with breakpoints in chromosome
band 7q11.23 (refs 1-5). The contribution of specific genes to the
neuroanatomical and functional alterations, leading to behavioural pathologies in
humans, remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate neural progenitor cells
and cortical neurons derived from Williams syndrome and typically developing
induced pluripotent stem cells. Neural progenitor cells in Williams syndrome have
an increased doubling time and apoptosis compared with typically developing
neural progenitor cells. Using an individual with atypical Williams syndrome, we 
narrowed this cellular phenotype to a single gene candidate, frizzled 9 (FZD9).
At the neuronal stage, layer V/VI cortical neurons derived from Williams syndrome
were characterized by longer total dendrites, increased numbers of spines and
synapses, aberrant calcium oscillation and altered network connectivity.
Morphometric alterations observed in neurons from Williams syndrome were
validated after Golgi staining of post-mortem layer V/VI cortical neurons. This
model of human induced pluripotent stem cells fills the current knowledge gap in 
the cellular biology of Williams syndrome and could lead to further insights into
the molecular mechanism underlying the disorder and the human social brain.

During pre-implantation development, the mammalian embryo self-organizes into the
blastocyst, which consists of an epithelial layer encapsulating the inner-cell
mass (ICM) giving rise to all embryonic tissues. In mice, oriented cell division,
apicobasal polarity and actomyosin contractility are thought to contribute to the
formation of the ICM. However, how these processes work together remains unclear.
Here we show that asymmetric segregation of the apical domain generates
blastomeres with different contractilities, which triggers their sorting into
inner and outer positions. Three-dimensional physical modelling of embryo
morphogenesis reveals that cells internalize only when differences in surface
contractility exceed a predictable threshold. We validate this prediction using
biophysical measurements, and successfully redirect cell sorting within the
developing blastocyst using maternal myosin (Myh9)-knockout chimaeric embryos.
Finally, we find that loss of contractility causes blastomeres to show ICM-like
markers, regardless of their position. In particular, contractility controls Yap 
subcellular localization, raising the possibility that mechanosensing occurs
during blastocyst lineage specification. We conclude that contractility couples
the positioning and fate specification of blastomeres. We propose that this
ensures the robust self-organization of blastomeres into the blastocyst, which
confers remarkable regulative capacities to mammalian embryos.

Sleep disconnects animals from the external world, at considerable risks and
costs that must be offset by a vital benefit. Insight into this mysterious
benefit will come from understanding sleep homeostasis: to monitor sleep need, an
internal bookkeeper must track physiological changes that are linked to the core 
function of sleep. In Drosophila, a crucial component of the machinery for sleep 
homeostasis is a cluster of neurons innervating the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) 
of the central complex. Artificial activation of these cells induces sleep,
whereas reductions in excitability cause insomnia. dFB neurons in sleep-deprived 
flies tend to be electrically active, with high input resistances and long
membrane time constants, while neurons in rested flies tend to be electrically
silent. Correlative evidence thus supports the simple view that homeostatic sleep
control works by switching sleep-promoting neurons between active and quiescent
states. Here we demonstrate state switching by dFB neurons, identify dopamine as 
a neuromodulator that operates the switch, and delineate the switching mechanism.
Arousing dopamine caused transient hyperpolarization of dFB neurons within tens
of milliseconds and lasting excitability suppression within minutes. Both effects
were transduced by Dop1R2 receptors and mediated by potassium conductances. The
switch to electrical silence involved the downregulation of voltage-gated A-type 
currents carried by Shaker and Shab, and the upregulation of voltage-independent 
leak currents through a two-pore-domain potassium channel that we term Sandman.
Sandman is encoded by the CG8713 gene and translocates to the plasma membrane in 
response to dopamine. dFB-restricted interference with the expression of Shaker
or Sandman decreased or increased sleep, respectively, by slowing the repetitive 
discharge of dFB neurons in the ON state or blocking their entry into the OFF
state. Biophysical changes in a small population of neurons are thus linked to
the control of sleep-wake state.

Circadian neuron feedback controls the Drosophila sleep--activity profile.

Guo F, Yu J, Jung HJ, Abruzzi KC, Luo W, Griffith LC, Rosbash M.

Little is known about the ability of Drosophila circadian neurons to promote
sleep. Here we show, using optogenetic manipulation and video recording, that a
subset of dorsal clock neurons (DN1s) are potent sleep-promoting cells that
release glutamate to directly inhibit key pacemaker neurons. The pacemakers
promote morning arousal by activating these DN1s, implying that a late-day
feedback circuit drives midday siesta and night-time sleep. To investigate more
plastic aspects of the sleep program, we used a calcium assay to monitor and
compare the real-time activity of DN1 neurons in freely behaving males and
females. Our results revealed that DN1 neurons were more active in males than in 
females, consistent with the finding that male flies sleep more during the day.
DN1 activity is also enhanced by elevated temperature, consistent with the
ability of higher temperatures to increase sleep. These new approaches indicate
that DN1s have a major effect on the fly sleep-wake profile and integrate
environmental information with the circadian molecular program.

Defining the clonal dynamics leading to mouse skin tumour initiation.

Sánchez-Danés A, Hannezo E, Larsimont JC, Liagre M, Youssef KK, Simons BD,
Blanpain C.

The changes in cell dynamics after oncogenic mutation that lead to the
development of tumours are currently unknown. Here, using skin epidermis as a
model, we assessed the effect of oncogenic hedgehog signalling in distinct cell
populations and their capacity to induce basal cell carcinoma, the most frequent 
cancer in humans. We found that only stem cells, and not progenitors, initiated
tumour formation upon oncogenic hedgehog signalling. This difference was due to
the hierarchical organization of tumour growth in oncogene-targeted stem cells,
characterized by an increase in symmetric self-renewing divisions and a higher
p53-dependent resistance to apoptosis, leading to rapid clonal expansion and
progression into invasive tumours. Our work reveals that the capacity of
oncogene-targeted cells to induce tumour formation is dependent not only on their
long-term survival and expansion, but also on the specific clonal dynamics of the
cancer cell of origin.

An early geodynamo driven by exsolution of mantle components from Earth's core.

Badro J, Siebert J, Nimmo F.

Erratum in
    Nature. 2016 Nov 17;539(7629):456.

Recent palaeomagnetic observations report the existence of a magnetic field on
Earth that is at least 3.45 billion years old. Compositional buoyancy caused by
inner-core growth is the primary driver of Earth's present-day geodynamo, but the
inner core is too young to explain the existence of a magnetic field before about
one billion years ago. Theoretical models propose that the exsolution of
magnesium oxide--the major constituent of Earth's mantle--from the core provided 
a major source of the energy required to drive an early dynamo, but experimental 
evidence for the incorporation of mantle components into the core has been
lacking. Indeed, terrestrial core formation occurred in the early molten Earth by
gravitational segregation of immiscible metal and silicate melts, transporting
iron-loving (siderophile) elements from the silicate mantle to the metallic core 
and leaving rock-loving (lithophile) mantle components behind. Here we present
experiments showing that magnesium oxide dissolves in core-forming iron melt at
very high temperatures. Using core-formation models, we show that extreme events 
during Earth's accretion (such as the Moon-forming giant impact) could have
contributed large amounts of magnesium to the early core. As the core
subsequently cooled, exsolution of buoyant magnesium oxide would have taken place
at the core–mantle boundary, generating a substantial amount of gravitational
energy as a result of compositional buoyancy. This amount of energy is comparable
to, if not more than, that produced by inner-core growth, resolving the conundrum
posed by the existence of an ancient magnetic field prior to the formation of the
inner core.

High-efficiency two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite solar cells.

Verduzco R, Crochet JJ, Tretiak S, Pedesseau L, Even J, Alam MA, Gupta G, Lou J,

Three-dimensional organic-inorganic perovskites have emerged as one of the most
promising thin-film solar cell materials owing to their remarkable photophysical 
properties, which have led to power conversion efficiencies exceeding 20 per
cent, with the prospect of further improvements towards the Shockley-Queisser
limit for a single‐junction solar cell (33.5 per cent). Besides efficiency,
another critical factor for photovoltaics and other optoelectronic applications
is environmental stability and photostability under operating conditions. In
contrast to their three-dimensional counterparts, Ruddlesden-Popper
phases--layered two-dimensional perovskite films--have shown promising stability,
but poor efficiency at only 4.73 per cent. This relatively poor efficiency is
attributed to the inhibition of out-of-plane charge transport by the organic
cations, which act like insulating spacing layers between the conducting
inorganic slabs. Here we overcome this issue in layered perovskites by producing 
thin films of near-single-crystalline quality, in which the crystallographic
planes of the inorganic perovskite component have a strongly preferential
out-of-plane alignment with respect to the contacts in planar solar cells to
facilitate efficient charge transport. We report a photovoltaic efficiency of
12.52 per cent with no hysteresis, and the devices exhibit greatly improved
stability in comparison to their three-dimensional counterparts when subjected to
light, humidity and heat stress tests. Unencapsulated two-dimensional perovskite 
devices retain over 60 per cent of their efficiency for over 2,250 hours under
constant, standard (AM1.5G) illumination, and exhibit greater tolerance to 65 per
cent relative humidity than do three-dimensional equivalents. When the devices
are encapsulated, the layered devices do not show any degradation under constant 
AM1.5G illumination or humidity. We anticipate that these results will lead to
the growth of single-crystalline, solution-processed, layered, hybrid, perovskite
thin films, which are essential for high-performance opto-electronic devices with
technologically relevant long-term stability.

Mixed conductors-single phases that conduct electronically and ionically-enable
stoichiometric variations in a material and, therefore, mass storage and
redistribution, for example, in battery electrodes. We have considered how such
properties may be achieved synergistically in solid two-phase systems, forming
artificial mixed conductors. Previously investigated composites suffered from
poor kinetics and did not allow for a clear determination of such stoichiometric 
variations. Here we show, using electrochemical and chemical methods, that a
melt-processed composite of the 'super-ionic' conductor RbAg4I5 and the
electronic conductor graphite exhibits both a remarkable silver excess and a
silver deficiency, similar to those found in single-phase mixed conductors, even 
though such behaviour is not possible in the individual phases. Furthermore, the 
kinetics of silver uptake and release is very fast. Evaluating the upper limit of
the relaxation time [corrected] set by interfacial ambipolar diffusion reveals
chemical diffusion coefficients that are even higher than those achieved for
sodium chloride in bulk liquid water. These results could potentially stimulate
systematic research into powerful, even mesoscopic, artificial mixed conductors.

Tumour-cell-induced endothelial cell necroptosis via death receptor 6 promotes
metastasis.

M, Offermanns S.

Comment in
    Nature. 2016 Aug 11;536(7615):154-5.

Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death in humans. It is a
complex multistep process during which individual tumour cells spread primarily
through the circulatory system to colonize distant organs. Once in the
circulation, tumour cells remain vulnerable, and their metastatic potential
largely depends on a rapid and efficient way to escape from the blood stream by
passing the endothelial barrier. Evidence has been provided that tumour cell
extravasation resembles leukocyte transendothelial migration. However, it remains
unclear how tumour cells interact with endothelial cells during extravasation and
how these processes are regulated on a molecular level. Here we show that human
and murine tumour cells induce programmed necrosis (necroptosis) of endothelial
cells, which promotes tumour cell extravasation and metastasis. Treatment of mice
with the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)-inhibitor
necrostatin-1 or endothelial-cell-specific deletion of RIPK3 reduced
tumour-cell-induced endothelial necroptosis, tumour cell extravasation and
metastasis. In contrast, pharmacological caspase inhibition or
endothelial-cell-specific loss of caspase-8 promoted these processes. We
furthermore show in vitro and in vivo that tumour-cell-induced endothelial
necroptosis leading to extravasation and metastasis requires amyloid precursor
protein expressed by tumour cells and its receptor, death receptor 6 (DR6), on
endothelial cells as the primary mediators of these effects. Our data identify a 
new mechanism underlying tumour cell extravasation and metastasis, and suggest
endothelial DR6-mediated necroptotic signalling pathways as targets for
anti-metastatic therapies.

Reconstruction of bacterial transcription-coupled repair at single-molecule
resolution.

Fan J, Leroux-Coyau M, Savery NJ, Strick TR.

Escherichia coli Mfd translocase enables transcription-coupled repair by
displacing RNA polymerase (RNAP) stalled on a DNA lesion and then coordinating
assembly of the UvrAB(C) components at the damage site. Recent studies have shown
that after binding to and dislodging stalled RNAP, Mfd remains on the DNA in the 
form of a stable, slowly translocating complex with evicted RNAP attached. Here
we find, using a series of single-molecule assays, that recruitment of UvrA and
UvrAB to Mfd-RNAP arrests the translocating complex and causes its dissolution.
Correlative single-molecule nanomanipulation and fluorescence measurements show
that dissolution of the complex leads to loss of both RNAP and Mfd. Subsequent
DNA incision by UvrC is faster than when only UvrAB(C) are available, in part
because UvrAB binds 20-200 times more strongly to Mfd–RNAP than to DNA damage.
These observations provide a quantitative framework for comparing complementary
DNA repair pathways in vivo.

Cotranslational signal-independent SRP preloading during membrane targeting.

Chartron JW, Hunt KC, Frydman J.

Ribosome-associated factors must properly decode the limited information
available in nascent polypeptides to direct them to their correct cellular fate. 
It is unclear how the low complexity information exposed by the nascent chain
suffices for accurate recognition by the many factors competing for the limited
surface near the ribosomal exit site. Questions remain even for the well-studied 
cotranslational targeting cycle to the endoplasmic reticulum, involving
recognition of linear hydrophobic signal sequences or transmembrane domains by
the signal recognition particle (SRP). Notably, the SRP has low abundance
relative to the large number of ribosome-nascent-chain complexes (RNCs), yet it
accurately selects those destined for the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite their
overlapping specificities, the SRP and the cotranslationally acting Hsp70 display
precise mutually exclusive selectivity in vivo for their cognate RNCs. To
understand cotranslational nascent chain recognition in vivo, here we investigate
the cotranslational membrane-targeting cycle using ribosome profiling in yeast
cells coupled with biochemical fractionation of ribosome populations. We show
that the SRP preferentially binds secretory RNCs before their targeting signals
are translated. Non-coding mRNA elements can promote this signal-independent
pre-recruitment of SRP. Our study defines the complex kinetic interaction between
elongation in the cytosol and determinants in the polypeptide and mRNA that
modulate SRP–substrate selection and membrane targeting.

Global profiling of SRP interaction with nascent polypeptides.

Schibich D, Gloge F, Pöhner I, Björkholm P, Wade RC, von Heijne G, Bukau B,
Kramer G.

Signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved protein-RNA complex 
that mediates co-translational protein translocation and membrane insertion by
targeting translating ribosomes to membrane translocons. The existence of
parallel co- and post-translational transport pathways, however, raises the
question of the cellular substrate pool of SRP and the molecular basis of
substrate selection. Here we determine the binding sites of bacterial SRP within 
the nascent proteome of Escherichia coli at amino acid resolution, by sequencing 
messenger RNA footprints of ribosome-nascent-chain complexes associated with SRP.
SRP, on the basis of its strong preference for hydrophobic transmembrane domains 
(TMDs), constitutes a compartment-specific targeting factor for nascent inner
membrane proteins (IMPs) that efficiently excludes signal-sequence-containing
precursors of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins. SRP associates with
hydrophobic TMDs enriched in consecutive stretches of hydrophobic and bulky
aromatic amino acids immediately on their emergence from the ribosomal exit
tunnel. By contrast with current models, N-terminal TMDs are frequently skipped
and TMDs internal to the polypeptide sequence are selectively recognized.
Furthermore, SRP binds several TMDs in many multi-spanning membrane proteins,
suggesting cycles of SRP-mediated membrane targeting. SRP-mediated targeting is
not accompanied by a transient slowdown of translation and is not influenced by
the ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor (TF), which has a distinct
substrate pool and acts at different stages during translation. Overall, our
proteome-wide data set of SRP-binding sites reveals the underlying principles of 
pathway decisions for nascent chains in bacteria, with SRP acting as the dominant
triaging factor, sufficient to separate IMPs from substrates of the SecA-SecB
post-translational translocation and TF-assisted cytosolic protein folding
pathways.

Mechanism of arginine sensing by CASTOR1 upstream of mTORC1.

Saxton RA, Chantranupong L, Knockenhauer KE, Schwartz TU, Sabatini DM.

The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major regulator of
eukaryotic growth that coordinates anabolic and catabolic cellular processes with
inputs such as growth factors and nutrients, including amino acids. In mammals
arginine is particularly important, promoting diverse physiological effects such 
as immune cell activation, insulin secretion, and muscle growth, largely mediated
through activation of mTORC1 (refs 4, 5, 6, 7). Arginine activates mTORC1
upstream of the Rag family of GTPases, through either the lysosomal amino acid
transporter SLC38A9 or the GATOR2-interacting Cellular Arginine Sensor for mTORC1
(CASTOR1). However, the mechanism by which the mTORC1 pathway detects and
transmits this arginine signal has been elusive. Here, we present the 1.8 Å
crystal structure of arginine-bound CASTOR1. Homodimeric CASTOR1 binds arginine
at the interface of two Aspartate kinase, Chorismate mutase, TyrA (ACT) domains, 
enabling allosteric control of the adjacent GATOR2-binding site to trigger
dissociation from GATOR2 and downstream activation of mTORC1. Our data reveal
that CASTOR1 shares substantial structural homology with the lysine-binding
regulatory domain of prokaryotic aspartate kinases, suggesting that the mTORC1
pathway exploited an ancient, amino-acid-dependent allosteric mechanism to
acquire arginine sensitivity. Together, these results establish a structural
basis for arginine sensing by the mTORC1 pathway and provide insights into the
evolution of a mammalian nutrient sensor.

Genetic differences that specify unique aspects of human evolution have typically
been identified by comparative analyses between the genomes of humans and closely
related primates, including more recently the genomes of archaic hominins. Not
all regions of the genome, however, are equally amenable to such study. Recurrent
copy number variation (CNV) at chromosome 16p11.2 accounts for approximately 1%
of cases of autism and is mediated by a complex set of segmental duplications,
many of which arose recently during human evolution. Here we reconstruct the
evolutionary history of the locus and identify bolA family member 2 (BOLA2) as a 
gene duplicated exclusively in Homo sapiens. We estimate that a 95-kilobase-pair 
segment containing BOLA2 duplicated across the critical region approximately 282 
thousand years ago (ka), one of the latest among a series of genomic changes that
dramatically restructured the locus during hominid evolution. All humans examined
carried one or more copies of the duplication, which nearly fixed early in the
human lineage--a pattern unlikely to have arisen so rapidly in the absence of
selection (P < 0.0097). We show that the duplication of BOLA2 led to a novel,
human-specific in-frame fusion transcript and that BOLA2 copy number correlates
with both RNA expression (r = 0.36) and protein level (r = 0.65), with the
greatest expression difference between human and chimpanzee in experimentally
derived stem cells. Analyses of 152 patients carrying a chromosome 16p11.
rearrangement show that more than 96% of breakpoints occur within the H.
sapiens-specific duplication. In summary, the duplicative transposition of BOLA2 
at the root of the H. sapiens lineage about 282 ka simultaneously increased copy 
number of a gene associated with iron homeostasis and predisposed our species to 
recurrent rearrangements associated with disease.

SAR11 bacteria linked to ocean anoxia and nitrogen loss.

Bacteria of the SAR11 clade constitute up to one half of all microbial cells in
the oxygen-rich surface ocean. SAR11 bacteria are also abundant in oxygen minimum
zones (OMZs), where oxygen falls below detection and anaerobic microbes have
vital roles in converting bioavailable nitrogen to N2 gas. Anaerobic metabolism
has not yet been observed in SAR11, and it remains unknown how these bacteria
contribute to OMZ biogeochemical cycling. Here, genomic analysis of single cells 
from the world's largest OMZ revealed previously uncharacterized SAR11 lineages
with adaptations for life without oxygen, including genes for respiratory nitrate
reductases (Nar). SAR11 nar genes were experimentally verified to encode proteins
catalysing the nitrite-producing first step of denitrification and constituted
~40% of OMZ nar transcripts, with transcription peaking in the anoxic zone of
maximum nitrate reduction activity. These results link SAR11 to pathways of ocean
nitrogen loss, redefining the ecological niche of Earth's most abundant
organismal group.

Tempo and mode of genome evolution in a 50,000-generation experiment.

GC, Wielgoss S, Cruveiller S, Médigue C, Schneider D, Lenski RE.

Adaptation by natural selection depends on the rates, effects and interactions of
many mutations, making it difficult to determine what proportion of mutations in 
an evolving lineage are beneficial. Here we analysed 264 complete genomes from 12
Escherichia coli populations to characterize their dynamics over 50,000
generations. The populations that retained the ancestral mutation rate support a 
model in which most fixed mutations are beneficial, the fraction of beneficial
mutations declines as fitness rises, and neutral mutations accumulate at a
constant rate. We also compared these populations to mutation-accumulation lines 
evolved under a bottlenecking regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous
mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions and deletions are overrepresented in 
the long-term populations, further supporting the inference that most mutations
that reached high frequency were favoured by selection. These results illuminate 
the shifting balance of forces that govern genome evolution in populations
adapting to a new environment.

Heating of Jupiter's upper atmosphere above the Great Red Spot.

O'Donoghue J, Moore L, Stallard TS, Melin H.

The temperatures of giant-planet upper atmospheres at mid- to low latitudes are
measured to be hundreds of degrees warmer than simulations based on solar heating
alone can explain. Modelling studies that focus on additional sources of heating 
have been unable to resolve this major discrepancy. Equatorward transport of
energy from the hot auroral regions was expected to heat the low latitudes, but
models have demonstrated that auroral energy is trapped at high latitudes, a
consequence of the strong Coriolis forces on rapidly rotating planets. Wave
heating, driven from below, represents another potential source of
upper-atmospheric heating, though initial calculations have proven inconclusive
for Jupiter, largely owing to a lack of observational constraints on wave
parameters. Here we report that the upper atmosphere above Jupiter's Great Red
Spot--the largest storm in the Solar System--is hundreds of degrees hotter than
anywhere else on the planet. This hotspot, by process of elimination, must be
heated from below, and this detection is therefore strong evidence for coupling
between Jupiter's lower and upper atmospheres, probably the result of upwardly
propagating acoustic or gravity waves.

Synaptic transmission is maintained by a delicate, sub-synaptic molecular
architecture, and even mild alterations in synapse structure drive functional
changes during experience-dependent plasticity and pathological disorders. Key to
this architecture is how the distribution of presynaptic vesicle fusion sites
corresponds to the position of receptors in the postsynaptic density. However,
while it has long been recognized that this spatial relationship modulates
synaptic strength, it has not been precisely described, owing in part to the
limited resolution of light microscopy. Using localization microscopy, here we
show that key proteins mediating vesicle priming and fusion are mutually
co-enriched within nanometre-scale subregions of the presynaptic active zone.
Through development of a new method to map vesicle fusion positions within single
synapses in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we find that
action-potential-evoked fusion is guided by this protein gradient and occurs
preferentially in confined areas with higher local density of Rab3-interacting
molecule (RIM) within the active zones. These presynaptic RIM nanoclusters
closely align with concentrated postsynaptic receptors and scaffolding proteins, 
suggesting the existence of a trans-synaptic molecular 'nanocolumn'. Thus, we
propose that the nanoarchitecture of the active zone directs
action-potential-evoked vesicle fusion to occur preferentially at sites directly 
opposing postsynaptic receptor-scaffold ensembles. Remarkably, NMDA receptor
activation triggered distinct phases of plasticity in which postsynaptic
reorganization was followed by trans-synaptic nanoscale realignment. This
architecture suggests a simple organizational principle of central nervous system
synapses to maintain and modulate synaptic efficiency.

An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis.

Rousseau A, Bertolotti A.

Comment in
    Nature. 2016 Aug 11;536(7615):155-6.

The proteasome is essential for the selective degradation of most cellular
proteins, but how cells maintain adequate amounts of proteasome is unclear. Here 
we show that there is an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway controlling 
proteasome homeostasis. Central to this pathway is TORC1, the inhibition of which
induced all known yeast 19S regulatory particle assembly-chaperones (RACs), as
well as proteasome subunits. Downstream of TORC1 inhibition, the yeast
mitogen-activated protein kinase, Mpk1, acts to increase the supply of RACs and
proteasome subunits under challenging conditions in order to maintain proteasomal
degradation and cell viability. This adaptive pathway was evolutionarily
conserved, with mTOR and ERK5 controlling the levels of the four mammalian RACs
and proteasome abundance. Thus, the central growth and stress controllers, TORC1 
and Mpk1/ERK5, endow cells with a rapid and vital adaptive response to adjust
proteasome abundance in response to the rising needs of cells. Enhancing this
pathway may be a useful therapeutic approach for diseases resulting from impaired
proteasomal degradation.

Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or
parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an
accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using
multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and
an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per
hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function,
connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210
healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously
reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific
approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in 
new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier 
to recognize the multi-modal 'fingerprint' of each cortical area. This classifier
detected the presence of 96.6% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated 
the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with
atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will
enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the
structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation
across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.

Abrupt plate accelerations shape rifted continental margins.

Brune S, Williams SE, Butterworth NP, Müller RD.

Rifted margins are formed by persistent stretching of continental lithosphere
until breakup is achieved. It is well known that strain-rate-dependent processes 
control rift evolution, yet quantified extension histories of Earth's major
passive margins have become available only recently. Here we investigate rift
kinematics globally by applying a new geotectonic analysis technique to revised
global plate reconstructions. We find that rifted margins feature an initial,
slow rift phase (less than ten millimetres per year, full rate) and that an
abrupt increase of plate divergence introduces a fast rift phase. Plate
acceleration takes place before continental rupture and considerable margin area 
is created during each phase. We reproduce the rapid transition from slow to fast
extension using analytical and numerical modelling with constant force boundary
conditions. The extension models suggest that the two-phase velocity behaviour is
caused by a rift-intrinsic strength--velocity feedback, which can be robustly
inferred for diverse lithosphere configurations and rheologies. Our results
explain differences between proximal and distal margin areas and demonstrate that
abrupt plate acceleration during continental rifting is controlled by the
nonlinear decay of the resistive rift strength force. This mechanism provides an 
explanation for several previously unexplained rapid absolute plate motion
changes, offering new insights into the balance of plate driving forces through
time.

Single-layer MoS2 nanopores as nanopower generators.

Feng J, Graf M, Liu K, Ovchinnikov D, Dumcenco D, Heiranian M, Nandigana V, Aluru
NR, Kis A, Radenovic A.

Making use of the osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and seawater is
an attractive, renewable and clean way to generate power and is known as 'blue
energy'. Another electrokinetic phenomenon, called the streaming potential,
occurs when an electrolyte is driven through narrow pores either by a pressure
gradient or by an osmotic potential resulting from a salt concentration gradient.
For this task, membranes made of two-dimensional materials are expected to be the
most efficient, because water transport through a membrane scales inversely with 
membrane thickness. Here we demonstrate the use of single-layer molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) nanopores as osmotic nanopower generators. We observe a large,
osmotically induced current produced from a salt gradient with an estimated power
density of up to 10(6) watts per square metre--a current that can be attributed
mainly to the atomically thin membrane of MoS2. Low power requirements for
nanoelectronic and optoelectric devices can be provided by a neighbouring
nanogenerator that harvests energy from the local environment--for example, a
piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowire array or single-layer MoS2 (ref. 12). We use
our MoS2 nanopore generator to power a MoS2 transistor, thus demonstrating a
self-powered nanosystem.

A photon-photon quantum gate based on a single atom in an optical resonator.

Hacker B, Welte S, Rempe G, Ritter S.

That two photons pass each other undisturbed in free space is ideal for the
faithful transmission of information, but prohibits an interaction between the
photons. Such an interaction is, however, required for a plethora of applications
in optical quantum information processing. The long-standing challenge here is to
realize a deterministic photon-photon gate, that is, a mutually controlled logic 
operation on the quantum states of the photons. This requires an interaction so
strong that each of the two photons can shift the other's phase by π radians. For
polarization qubits, this amounts to the conditional flipping of one photon's
polarization to an orthogonal state. So far, only probabilistic gates based on
linear optics and photon detectors have been realized, because "no known or
foreseen material has an optical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this
conditional phase shift''. Meanwhile, tremendous progress in the development of
quantum-nonlinear systems has opened up new possibilities for single-photon
experiments. Platforms range from Rydberg blockade in atomic ensembles to
single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics. Applications such as single-photon
switches and transistors, two-photon gateways, nondestructive photon detectors,
photon routers and nonlinear phase shifters have been demonstrated, but none of
them with the ideal information carriers: optical qubits in discriminable modes. 
Here we use the strong light-matter coupling provided by a single atom in a
high-finesse optical resonator to realize the Duan-Kimble protocol of a universal
controlled phase flip (π phase shift) photon-photon quantum gate. We achieve an
average gate fidelity of (76.2 ± 3.6) per cent and specifically demonstrate the
capability of conditional polarization flipping as well as entanglement
generation between independent input photons. This photon-photon quantum gate is 
a universal quantum logic element, and therefore could perform most existing
two-photon operations. The demonstrated feasibility of deterministic protocols
for the optical processing of quantum information could lead to new applications 
in which photons are essential, especially long-distance quantum communication
and scalable quantum computing.

Moving mechanical interfaces are commonly lubricated and separated by a
combination of fluid films and solid 'tribofilms', which together ensure easy
slippage and long wear life. The efficacy of the fluid film is governed by the
viscosity of the base oil in the lubricant; the efficacy of the solid tribofilm, 
which is produced as a result of sliding contact between moving parts, relies
upon the effectiveness of the lubricant's anti-wear additive (typically zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate). Minimizing friction and wear continues to be a
challenge, and recent efforts have focused on enhancing the anti-friction and
anti-wear properties of lubricants by incorporating inorganic nanoparticles and
ionic liquids. Here, we describe the in operando formation of carbon-based
tribofilms via dissociative extraction from base-oil molecules on catalytically
active, sliding nanometre-scale crystalline surfaces, enabling base oils to
provide not only the fluid but also the solid tribofilm. We study nanocrystalline
catalytic coatings composed of nitrides of either molybdenum or vanadium,
containing either copper or nickel catalysts, respectively. Structurally, the
resulting tribofilms are similar to diamond-like carbon. Ball-on-disk tests at
contact pressures of 1.3 gigapascals reveal that these tribofilms nearly
eliminate wear, and provide lower friction than tribofilms formed with zinc
dialkyldithiophosphate. Reactive and ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations
show that the catalytic action of the coatings facilitates dehydrogenation of
linear olefins in the lubricating oil and random scission of their carbon-carbon 
backbones; the products recombine to nucleate and grow a compact, amorphous
lubricating tribofilm.

Quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than any possible
conventional computer. Small quantum algorithms have been demonstrated on
multiple quantum computing platforms, many specifically tailored in hardware to
implement a particular algorithm or execute a limited number of computational
paths. Here we demonstrate a five-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer that can be 
programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum algorithms by executing any
sequence of universal quantum logic gates. We compile algorithms into a fully
connected set of gate operations that are native to the hardware and have a mean 
fidelity of 98 per cent. Reconfiguring these gate sequences provides the
flexibility to implement a variety of algorithms without altering the hardware.
As examples, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms
with average success rates of 95 and 90 per cent, respectively. We also perform a
coherent quantum Fourier transform on five trapped-ion qubits for phase
estimation and period finding with average fidelities of 62 and 84 per cent,
respectively. This small quantum computer can be scaled to larger numbers of
qubits within a single register, and can be further expanded by connecting
several such modules through ion shuttling or photonic quantum channels.

In 1909, Millikan showed that the charge of electrically isolated systems is
quantized in units of the elementary electron charge e. Today, the persistence of
charge quantization in small, weakly connected conductors allows for circuits in 
which single electrons are manipulated, with applications in, for example,
metrology, detectors and thermometry. However, as the connection strength is
increased, the discreteness of charge is progressively reduced by quantum
fluctuations. Here we report the full quantum control and characterization of
charge quantization. By using semiconductor-based tunable elemental conduction
channels to connect a micrometre-scale metallic island to a circuit, we explore
the complete evolution of charge quantization while scanning the entire range of 
connection strengths, from a very weak (tunnel) to a perfect (ballistic) contact.
We observe, when approaching the ballistic limit, that charge quantization is
destroyed by quantum fluctuations, and scales as the square root of the residual 
probability for an electron to be reflected across the quantum channel; this
scaling also applies beyond the different regimes of connection strength
currently accessible to theory. At increased temperatures, the thermal
fluctuations result in an exponential suppression of charge quantization and in a
universal square-root scaling, valid for all connection strengths, in agreement
with expectations. Besides being pertinent for the improvement of single-electron
circuits and their applications, and for the metal-semiconductor hybrids relevant
to topological quantum computing, knowledge of the quantum laws of electricity
will be essential for the quantum engineering of future nanoelectronic devices.

A novel excitatory network for the control of breathing.

Anderson TM, Garcia AJ 3rd, Baertsch NA, Pollak J, Bloom JC, Wei AD, Rai KG,
Ramirez JM.

Breathing must be tightly coordinated with other behaviours such as vocalization,
swallowing, and coughing. These behaviours occur after inspiration, during a
respiratory phase termed postinspiration. Failure to coordinate postinspiration
with inspiration can result in aspiration pneumonia, the leading cause of death
in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and other
neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe an excitatory network that generates
the neuronal correlate of postinspiratory activity in mice.
Glutamatergic-cholinergic neurons form the basis of this network, and GABA
(γ-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition establishes the timing and coordination
relative to inspiration. We refer to this network as the postinspiratory complex 
(PiCo). The PiCo has autonomous rhythm-generating properties and is necessary and
sufficient for postinspiratory activity in vivo.The PiCo also shows distinct
responses to neuromodulators when compared to other excitatory brainstem
networks. On the basis of the discovery of the PiCo, we propose that each of the 
three phases of breathing is generated by a distinct excitatory network: the
pre-Bötzinger complex, which has been linked to inspiration; the PiCo, as
described here for the neuronal control of postinspiration; and the lateral
parafacial region (pF(L)), which has been associated with active expiration, a
respiratory phase that is recruited during high metabolic demand.

eIF3d is an mRNA cap-binding protein that is required for specialized translation
initiation.

Lee AS, Kranzusch PJ, Doudna JA, Cate JH.

Eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 5′ cap structure that is crucial for recruitment of
the translation machinery and initiation of protein synthesis. mRNA recognition
is thought to require direct interactions between eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E) and the mRNA cap. However, translation of numerous capped mRNAs remains
robust during cellular stress, early development, and cell cycle progression
despite inactivation of eIF4E. Here we describe a cap-dependent pathway of
translation initiation in human cells that relies on a previously unknown
cap-binding activity of eIF3d, a subunit of the 800-kilodalton eIF3 complex. A
1.4 Å crystal structure of the eIF3d cap-binding domain reveals unexpected
homology to endonucleases involved in RNA turnover, and allows modelling of cap
recognition by eIF3d. eIF3d makes specific contacts with the cap, as exemplified 
by cap analogue competition, and these interactions are essential for assembly of
translation initiation complexes on eIF3-specialized mRNAs such as the cell
proliferation regulator c-Jun (also known as JUN). The c-Jun mRNA further encodes
an inhibitory RNA element that blocks eIF4E recruitment, thus enforcing
alternative cap recognition by eIF3d. Our results reveal a mechanism of
cap-dependent translation that is independent of eIF4E, and illustrate how
modular RNA elements work together to direct specialized forms of translation
initiation.

    Nature. 2016 Oct 27;538(7626):542.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential components of the signalling
network throughout the body. To understand the molecular mechanism of
G-protein-mediated signalling, solved structures of receptors in inactive
conformations and in the active conformation coupled to a G protein are
necessary. Here we present the structure of the adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R)
bound to an engineered G protein, mini-Gs, at 3.4 Å resolution. Mini-Gs binds to 
A(2A)R through an extensive interface (1,048 Å2) that is similar, but not
identical, to the interface between Gs and the β2-adrenergic receptor. The
transition of the receptor from an agonist-bound active-intermediate state to an 
active G-protein-bound state is characterized by a 14 Å shift of the cytoplasmic 
end of transmembrane helix 6 (H6) away from the receptor core, slight changes in 
the positions of the cytoplasmic ends of H5 and H7 and rotamer changes of the
amino acid side chains Arg3.50, Tyr5.58 and Tyr7.53. There are no substantial
differences in the extracellular half of the receptor around the ligand binding
pocket. The A(2A)R-mini-Gs structure highlights both the diversity and similarity
in G-protein coupling to GPCRs and hints at the potential complexity of the
molecular basis for G-protein specificity.

The structural basis of modified nucleosome recognition by 53BP1.

Wilson MD, Benlekbir S, Fradet-Turcotte A, Sherker A, Julien JP, McEwan A,
Noordermeer SM, Sicheri F, Rubinstein JL, Durocher D.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) elicit a histone modification cascade that
controls DNA repair. This pathway involves the sequential ubiquitination of
histones H1 and H2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, respectively.
RNF168 ubiquitinates H2A on lysine 13 and lysine 15 (refs 7, 8) (yielding
H2AK13ub and H2AK15ub, respectively), an event that triggers the recruitment of
53BP1 (also known as TP53BP1) to chromatin flanking DSBs. 53BP1 binds
specifically to H2AK15ub-containing nucleosomes through a peptide segment termed 
the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment motif (UDR), which requires the
simultaneous engagement of histone H4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2) by its
tandem Tudor domain. How 53BP1 interacts with these two histone marks in the
nucleosomal context, how it recognizes ubiquitin, and how it discriminates
between H2AK13ub and H2AK15ub is unknown. Here we present the electron
cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a dimerized human 53BP1 fragment bound to a
H4K20me2-containing and H2AK15ub-containing nucleosome core particle (NCP-ubme)
at 4.5 Å resolution. The structure reveals that H4K20me2 and H2AK15ub recognition
involves intimate contacts with multiple nucleosomal elements including the
acidic patch. Ubiquitin recognition by 53BP1 is unusual and involves the
sandwiching of the UDR segment between ubiquitin and the NCP surface. The
selectivity for H2AK15ub is imparted by two arginine fingers in the H2A
amino-terminal tail, which straddle the nucleosomal DNA and serve to position
ubiquitin over the NCP-bound UDR segment. The structure of the complex between
NCP-ubme and 53BP1 reveals the basis of 53BP1 recruitment to DSB sites and
illuminates how combinations of histone marks and nucleosomal elements cooperate 
to produce highly specific chromatin responses, such as those elicited following 
chromosome breaks.

The widespread view of bacteria as strictly pathogenic has given way to an
appreciation of the prevalence of some beneficial microbes within the human body.
It is perhaps inevitable that some bacteria would evolve to preferentially grow
in environments that harbor disease and thus provide a natural platform for the
development of engineered therapies. Such therapies could benefit from bacteria
that are programmed to limit bacterial growth while continually producing and
releasing cytotoxic agents in situ. Here we engineer a clinically relevant
bacterium to lyse synchronously ata threshold population density and to release
genetically encoded cargo. Following quorum lysis, a small number of surviving
bacteria reseed the growing population, thus leading to pulsatile delivery
cycles. We used microfluidic devices to characterize the engineered lysis strain 
and we demonstrate its potential as a drug delivery platform via co-culture with 
human cancer cells in vitro. Asa proof of principle, we tracked the bacterial
population dynamics in ectopic syngeneic colorectal tumours in mice via a
luminescent reporter. The lysis strain exhibits pulsatile population dynamics in 
vivo, with mean bacterial luminescence that remained two orders of magnitude
lower than an unmodified strain. Finally, guided by previous findings that
certain bacteria can enhance the efficacy of standard therapies, we orally
administered the lysis strain alone or in combination with a clinical
chemotherapeutic to a syngeneic mouse transplantation model of hepatic colorectal
metastases. We found that the combination of both circuit-engineered bacteria and
chemotherapy leads to a notable reduction of tumour activity along with a marked 
survival benefit over either therapy alone.Our approach establishes a methodology
for leveraging the tools of synthetic biology to exploit the natural propensity
for certain bacteria to colonize disease sites.

Atherosclerosis is the disease process that underlies heart attack and stroke.
Advanced lesions at risk of rupture are characterized by the pathological
accumulation of diseased vascular cells and apoptotic cellular debris. Why these 
cells are not cleared remains unknown. Here we show that atherogenesis is
associated with upregulation of CD47, a key anti-phagocytic molecule that is
known to render malignant cells resistant to programmed cell removal, or
'efferocytosis'. We find that administration of CD47-blocking antibodies reverses
this defect in efferocytosis, normalizes the clearance of diseased vascular
tissue, and ameliorates atherosclerosis in multiple mouse models. Mechanistic
studies implicate the pro-atherosclerotic factor TNF-α as a fundamental driver of
impaired programmed cell removal, explaining why this process is compromised in
vascular disease. Similar to recent observations in cancer, impaired
efferocytosis appears to play a pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease, but is
not a fixed defect and may represent a novel therapeutic target.

The genetic architecture of common traits, including the number, frequency, and
effect sizes of inherited variants that contribute to individual risk, has been
long debated. Genome-wide association studies have identified scores of common
variants associated with type 2 diabetes, but in aggregate, these explain only a 
fraction of the heritability of this disease. Here, to test the hypothesis that
lower-frequency variants explain much of the remainder, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES
consortia performed whole-genome sequencing in 2,657 European individuals with
and without diabetes, and exome sequencing in 12,940 individuals from five
ancestry groups. To increase statistical power, we expanded the sample size via
genotyping and imputation in a further 111,548 subjects. Variants associated with
type 2 diabetes after sequencing were overwhelmingly common and most fell within 
regions previously identified by genome-wide association studies. Comprehensive
enumeration of sequence variation is necessary to identify functional alleles
that provide important clues to disease pathophysiology, but large-scale
sequencing does not support the idea that lower-frequency variants have a major
role in predisposition to type 2 diabetes.

Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record.

Norris JR, Allen RJ, Evan AT, Zelinka MD, O'Dell CW, Klein SA.

Clouds substantially affect Earth's energy budget by reflecting solar radiation
back to space and by restricting emission of thermal radiation to space. They are
perhaps the largest uncertainty in our understanding of climate change, owing to 
disagreement among climate models and observational datasets over what cloud
changes have occurred during recent decades and will occur in response to global 
warming. This is because observational systems originally designed for monitoring
weather have lacked sufficient stability to detect cloud changes reliably over
decades unless they have been corrected to remove artefacts. Here we show that
several independent, empirically corrected satellite records exhibit large-scale 
patterns of cloud change between the 1980s and the 2000s that are similar to
those produced by model simulations of climate with recent historical external
radiative forcing. Observed and simulated cloud change patterns are consistent
with poleward retreat of mid-latitude storm tracks, expansion of subtropical dry 
zones, and increasing height of the highest cloud tops at all latitudes. The
primary drivers of these cloud changes appear to be increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations and a recovery from volcanic radiative cooling. These results
indicate that the cloud changes most consistently predicted by global climate
models are currently occurring in nature.

Architecture of fully occupied GluA2 AMPA receptor-TARP complex elucidated by
cryo-EM.

Zhao Y, Chen S, Yoshioka C, Baconguis I, Gouaux E.

Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system is
largely carried out by AMPA-sensitive ionotropic glutamate receptors. Localized
within the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic spines, AMPA receptors are
composed of heterotetrameric receptor assemblies associated with auxiliary
subunits, the most common of which are transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory
proteins (TARPs). The association of TARPs with AMPA receptors modulates receptor
trafficking and the kinetics of receptor gating and pharmacology. Here we report 
the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the homomeric rat GluA2 AMPA 
receptor saturated with TARP γ2 subunits, which shows how the TARPs are arranged 
with four-fold symmetry around the ion channel domain and make extensive
interactions with the M1, M2 and M4 transmembrane helices. Poised like partially 
opened ‘hands’ underneath the two-fold symmetric ligand-binding domain (LBD)
'clamshells', one pair of TARPs is juxtaposed near the LBD dimer interface,
whereas the other pair is near the LBD dimer-dimer interface. The extracellular
‘domains’ of TARP are positioned to not only modulate LBD clamshell closure, but 
also affect conformational rearrangements of the LBD layer associated with
receptor activation and desensitization, while the TARP transmembrane domains
buttress the ion channel pore.

The typically dark surface of the dwarf planet Ceres is punctuated by areas of
much higher albedo, most prominently in the Occator crater. These small bright
areas have been tentatively interpreted as containing a large amount of hydrated 
magnesium sulfate, in contrast to the average surface, which is a mixture of
low-albedo materials and magnesium phyllosilicates, ammoniated phyllosilicates
and carbonates. Here we report high spatial and spectral resolution near-infrared
observations of the bright areas in the Occator crater on Ceres. Spectra of these
bright areas are consistent with a large amount of sodium carbonate, constituting
the most concentrated known extraterrestrial occurrence of carbonate on
kilometre-wide scales in the Solar System. The carbonates are mixed with a dark
component and small amounts of phyllosilicates, as well as ammonium carbonate or 
ammonium chloride. Some of these compounds have also been detected in the plume
of Saturn’s sixth-largest moon Enceladus. The compounds are endogenous and we
propose that they are the solid residue of crystallization of brines and
entrained altered solids that reached the surface from below. The heat source may
have been transient (triggered by impact heating). Alternatively, internal
temperatures may be above the eutectic temperature of subsurface brines, in which
case fluids may exist at depth on Ceres today.

Neoantigen landscape dynamics during human melanoma-T cell interactions.

Hadrup SR, van der Minne CE, Schotte R, Spits H, Haanen JB, Kapiteijn EH,
Schumacher TN, van der Burg SH.

Recognition of neoantigens that are formed as a consequence of DNA damage is
likely to form a major driving force behind the clinical activity of cancer
immunotherapies such as T-cell checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell therapy.
Therefore, strategies to selectively enhance T-cell reactivity against
genetically defined neoantigens are currently under development. In mouse models,
T-cell pressure can sculpt the antigenicity of tumours, resulting in the
emergence of tumours that lack defined mutant antigens. However, whether the
T-cell-recognized neoantigen repertoire in human cancers is constant over time is
unclear. Here we analyse the stability of neoantigen-specific T-cell responses
and the antigens they recognize in two patients with stage IV melanoma treated by
adoptive T-cell transfer. The T-cell-recognized neoantigens can be selectively
lost from the tumour cell population, either by overall reduced expression of the
genes or loss of the mutant alleles. Notably, loss of expression of
T-cell-recognized neoantigens was accompanied by development of
neoantigen-specific T-cell reactivity in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. These
data demonstrate the dynamic interactions between cancer cells and T cells, which
suggest that T cells mediate neoantigen immunoediting, and indicate that the
therapeutic induction of broad neoantigen-specific T-cell responses should be
used to avoid tumour resistance.

Zika virus is a member of the Flavivirus genus that had not been associated with 
severe disease in humans until the recent outbreaks, when it was linked to
microcephaly in newborns in Brazil and to Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults in
French Polynesia. Zika virus is related to dengue virus, and here we report that 
a subset of antibodies targeting a conformational epitope isolated from patients 
with dengue virus also potently neutralize Zika virus. The crystal structure of
two of these antibodies in complex with the envelope protein of Zika virus
reveals the details of a conserved epitope, which is also the site of interaction
of the envelope protein dimer with the precursor membrane (prM) protein during
virus maturation. Comparison of the Zika and dengue virus immunocomplexes
provides a lead for rational, epitope-focused design of a universal vaccine
capable of eliciting potent cross-neutralizing antibodies to protect
simultaneously against both Zika and dengue virus infections.

During chronic viral infection, virus-specific CD8(+) T cells become exhausted,
exhibit poor effector function and lose memory potential. However, exhausted
CD8(+) T cells can still contain viral replication in chronic infections,
although the mechanism of this containment is largely unknown. Here we show that 
a subset of exhausted CD8(+) T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR5 has 
a critical role in the control of viral replication in mice that were chronically
infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These CXCR5(+) CD8(+) T 
cells were able to migrate into B-cell follicles, expressed lower levels of
inhibitory receptors and exhibited more potent cytotoxicity than the CXCR5(-)
[corrected] subset. Furthermore, we identified the Id2-E2A signalling axis as an 
important regulator of the generation of this subset. In patients with HIV, we
also identified a virus-specific CXCR5(+) CD8(+) T-cell subset, and its number
was inversely correlated with viral load. The CXCR5(+) subset showed greater
therapeutic potential than the CXCR5(-) [corrected] subset when adoptively
transferred to chronically infected mice, and exhibited synergistic reduction of 
viral load when combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment. This study defines a unique
subset of exhausted CD8(+) T cells that has a pivotal role in the control of
viral replication during chronic viral infection.

Neurons can release damaged mitochondria and transfer them to astrocytes for
disposal and recycling. This ability to exchange mitochondria may represent a
potential mode of cell-to-cell signalling in the central nervous system. Here we 
show that astrocytes in mice can also release functional mitochondria that enter 
neurons. Astrocytic release of extracellular mitochondrial particles was mediated
by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving CD38 and cyclic ADP ribose signalling.
Transient focal cerebral ischaemia in mice induced entry of astrocytic
mitochondria into adjacent neurons, and this entry amplified cell survival
signals. Suppression of CD38 signalling by short interfering RNA reduced
extracellular mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological outcomes. These
findings suggest a new mitochondrial mechanism of neuroglial crosstalk that may
contribute to endogenous neuroprotective and neurorecovery mechanisms after
stroke.

Current climate models systematically underestimate the strength of oceanic
fronts associated with strong western boundary currents, such as the Kuroshio and
Gulf Stream Extensions, and have difficulty simulating their positions at the
mid-latitude ocean's western boundaries. Even with an enhanced grid resolution to
resolve ocean mesoscale eddies-energetic circulations with horizontal scales of
about a hundred kilometres that strongly interact with the fronts and
currents-the bias problem can still persist; to improve climate models we need a 
better understanding of the dynamics governing these oceanic frontal regimes. Yet
prevailing theories about the western boundary fronts are based on ocean internal
dynamics without taking into consideration the intense air-sea feedbacks in these
oceanic frontal regions. Here, by focusing on the Kuroshio Extension Jet east of 
Japan as the direct continuation of the Kuroshio, we show that feedback between
ocean mesoscale eddies and the atmosphere (OME-A) is fundamental to the dynamics 
and control of these energetic currents. Suppressing OME-A feedback in
eddy-resolving coupled climate model simulations results in a 20-40 per cent
weakening in the Kuroshio Extension Jet. This is because OME-A feedback dominates
eddy potential energy destruction, which dissipates more than 70 per cent of the 
eddy potential energy extracted from the Kuroshio Extension Jet. The absence of
OME-A feedback inevitably leads to a reduction in eddy potential energy
production in order to balance the energy budget, which results in a weakened
mean current. The finding has important implications for improving climate
models' representation of major oceanic fronts, which are essential components in
the simulation and prediction of extratropical storms and other extreme events,
as well as in the projection of the effect on these events of climate change.

The structural complexity of metamaterials is limitless, but, in practice, most
designs comprise periodic architectures that lead to materials with spatially
homogeneous features. More advanced applications in soft robotics, prosthetics
and wearable technology involve spatially textured mechanical functionality,
which requires aperiodic architectures. However, a naive implementation of such
structural complexity invariably leads to geometrical frustration (whereby local 
constraints cannot be satisfied everywhere), which prevents coherent operation
and impedes functionality. Here we introduce a combinatorial strategy for the
design of aperiodic, yet frustration-free, mechanical metamaterials that exhibit 
spatially textured functionalities. We implement this strategy using cubic
building blocks-voxels-that deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule that
allows cooperative shape changes by guaranteeing that deformed building blocks
fit together as in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, and three-dimensional
printing. These aperiodic metamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order,
whereby the two-dimensional pixelated surface texture dictates the
three-dimensional interior voxel arrangement. They also act as programmable
shape-shifters, morphing into spatially complex, but predictable and designable, 
shapes when uniaxially compressed. Finally, their mechanical response to
compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform sensing and
pattern analysis. Combinatorial design thus opens up a new avenue towards
mechanical metamaterials with unusual order and machine-like functionalities.

In solar-type stars (with radiative cores and convective envelopes like our Sun),
the magnetic field powers star spots, flares and other solar phenomena, as well
as chromospheric and coronal emission at ultraviolet to X-ray wavelengths. The
dynamo responsible for generating the field depends on the shearing of internal
magnetic fields by differential rotation. The shearing has long been thought to
take place in a boundary layer known as the tachocline between the radiative core
and the convective envelope. Fully convective stars do not have a tachocline and 
their dynamo mechanism is expected to be very different, although its exact form 
and physical dependencies are not known. Here we report observations of four
fully convective stars whose X-ray emission correlates with their rotation
periods in the same way as in solar-type stars. As the X-ray activity-rotation
relationship is a well-established proxy for the behaviour of the magnetic
dynamo, these results imply that fully convective stars also operate a solar-type
dynamo. The lack of a tachocline in fully convective stars therefore suggests
that this is not a critical ingredient in the solar dynamo and supports models in
which the dynamo originates throughout the convection zone.

The vast majority of systemic bacterial infections are caused by facultative,
often antibiotic-resistant, pathogens colonizing human body surfaces. Nasal
carriage of Staphylococcus aureus predisposes to invasive infection, but the
mechanisms that permit or interfere with pathogen colonization are largely
unknown. Whereas soil microbes are known to compete by production of antibiotics,
such processes have rarely been reported for human microbiota. We show that nasal
Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains produce lugdunin, a novel
thiazolidine-containing cyclic peptide antibiotic that prohibits colonization by 
S. aureus, and a rare example of a non-ribosomally synthesized bioactive compound
from human-associated bacteria. Lugdunin is bactericidal against major pathogens,
effective in animal models, and not prone to causing development of resistance in
S. aureus. Notably, human nasal colonization by S. lugdunensis was associated
with a significantly reduced S. aureus carriage rate, suggesting that lugdunin or
lugdunin-producing commensal bacteria could be valuable for preventing
staphylococcal infections. Moreover, human microbiota should be considered as a
source for new antibiotics.

A somitic contribution to the apical ectodermal ridge is essential for fin
formation.

Masselink W, Cole NJ, Fenyes F, Berger S, Sonntag C, Wood A, Nguyen PD, Cohen N, 
Knopf F, Weidinger G, Hall TE, Currie PD.

The transition from fins to limbs was an important terrestrial adaptation, but
how this crucial evolutionary shift arose developmentally is unknown. Current
models focus on the distinct roles of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the
signaling molecules that it secretes during limb and fin outgrowth. In contrast
to the limb AER, the AER of the fin rapidly transitions into the apical fold and 
in the process shuts off AER-derived signals that stimulate proliferation of the 
precursors of the appendicular skeleton. The differing fates of the AER during
fish and tetrapod development have led to the speculation that fin-fold formation
was one of the evolutionary hurdles to the AER-dependent expansion of the fin
mesenchyme required to generate the increased appendicular structure evident
within limbs. Consequently, a heterochronic shift in the AER-to-apical-fold
transition has been postulated to be crucial for limb evolution. The ability to
test this model has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms
controlling apical fold induction. Here we show that invasion by cells of a newly
identified somite-derived lineage into the AER in zebrafish regulates apical fold
induction. Ablation of these cells inhibits apical fold formation, prolongs AER
activity and increases the amount of fin bud mesenchyme, suggesting that these
cells could provide the timing mechanism proposed in Thorogood's clock model of
the fin-to-limb transition. We further demonstrate that apical-fold inducing
cells are progressively lost during gnathostome evolution;the absence of such
cells within the tetrapod limb suggests that their loss may have been a necessary
prelude to the attainment of limb-like structures in Devonian sarcopterygian
fish.

Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the primary pathway for repairing DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. Such breaks are formed, for
example, during gene-segment rearrangements in the adaptive immune system or by
cancer therapeutic agents. Although the core components of the NHEJ machinery are
known, it has remained difficult to assess the specific roles of these components
and the dynamics of bringing and holding the fragments of broken DNA together.
The structurally similar XRCC4 and XLF proteins are proposed to assemble as
highly dynamic filaments at (or near) DSBs. Here we show, using dual- and
quadruple-trap optical tweezers combined with fluorescence microscopy, how human 
XRCC4, XLF and XRCC4-XLF complexes interact with DNA in real time. We find that
XLF stimulates the binding of XRCC4 to DNA, forming heteromeric complexes that
diffuse swiftly along the DNA. Moreover, we find that XRCC4-XLF complexes
robustly bridge two independent DNA molecules and that these bridges are able to 
slide along the DNA. These observations suggest that XRCC4-XLF complexes form
mobile sleeve-like structures around DNA that can reconnect the broken ends very 
rapidly and hold them together. Understanding the dynamics and regulation of this
mechanism will lead to clarification of how NHEJ proteins are involved in
generating chromosomal translocations.

Dynamics of ribosome scanning and recycling revealed by translation complex
profiling.

Archer SK, Shirokikh NE, Beilharz TH, Preiss T.

Regulation of messenger RNA translation is central to eukaryotic gene expression 
control. Regulatory inputs are specified by them RNA untranslated regions (UTRs) 
and often target translation initiation. Initiation involves binding of the 40S
ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and associated eukaryotic initiation factors
(eIFs)near the mRNA 5′ cap; the SSU then scans in the 3′ direction until it
detects the start codon and is joined by the 60S ribosomal large subunit (LSU) to
form the 80S ribosome. Scanning and other dynamic aspects of the initiation model
have remained as conjectures because methods to trap early intermediates were
lacking. Here we uncover the dynamics of the complete translation cycle in live
yeast cells using translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq), a method
developed from the ribosome profiling approach. We document scanning by observing
SSU footprints along 5′ UTRs. Scanning SSU have 5′-extended footprints (up to~75 
nucleotides), indicative of additional interactions with mRNA emerging from the
exit channel, promoting forward movement. We visualized changes in initiation
complex conformation as SSU footprints coalesced into three major sizes at start 
codons (19, 29 and 37 nucleotides). These share the same 5′ start site but differ
at the 3′ end, reflecting successive changes at the entry channel from an open to
a closed state following start codon recognition. We also observe SSU 'lingering'
at stop codons after LSU departure. Our results underpin mechanistic models of
translation initiation and termination, built on decades of biochemical and
structural investigation, with direct genome-wide in vivo evidence. Our approach 
captures ribosomal complexes at all phases of translation and will aid in
studying translation dynamics in diverse cellular contexts. Dysregulation of
translation is common in disease and, for example, SSU scanning is a target of
anti-cancer drug development. TCP-seq will prove useful in discerning differences
in mRNA-specific initiation in pathologies and their response to treatment.

Developmental signals of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt families are transduced across
the membrane by Frizzledclass G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) composed of
both a heptahelical transmembrane domain (TMD) and an extracellular cysteine-rich
domain (CRD). How the large extracellular domains of GPCRs regulate signalling by
the TMD is unknown. We present crystal structures of the Hh signal transducer and
oncoprotein Smoothened, a GPCR that contains two distinct ligand-binding sites:
one in its TMD and one in the CRD. The CRD is stacked a top the TMD, separated by
an intervening wedge-like linker domain. Structure-guided mutations show that the
interface between the CRD, linker domain and TMD stabilizes the inactive state of
Smoothened. Unexpectedly, we find a cholesterol molecule bound to Smoothened in
the CRD binding site. Mutations predicted to prevent cholesterol binding impair
the ability of Smoothened to transmit native Hh signals. Binding of a clinically 
used antagonist, vismodegib, to the TMD induces a conformational change that is
propagated to the CRD, resulting in loss of cholesterol from the CRD-linker
domain-TMD interface. Our results clarify the structural mechanism by which the
activity of a GPCR is controlled by ligand-regulated interactions between its
extracellular and transmembrane domains.

Structural organization of the inactive X chromosome in the mouse.

Giorgetti L, Lajoie BR, Carter AC, Attia M, Zhan Y, Xu J, Chen CJ, Kaplan N,
Chang HY, Heard E, Dekker J.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) involves major reorganization of the X chromosome
as it becomes silent and heterochromatic. During female mammalian development,
XCI is triggered by upregulation of the non-coding Xist RNA from one of the two X
chromosomes. Xist coats the chromosome in cis and induces silencing of almost all
genes via its A-repeat region, although some genes (constitutive escapees) avoid 
silencing in most cell types, and others (facultative escapees) escape XCI only
in specific contexts. A role for Xist in organizing the inactive X (Xi)
chromosome has been proposed. Recent chromosome conformation capture approaches
have revealed global loss of local structure on the Xi chromosome and formation
of large mega-domains, separated by a region containing the DXZ4 macrosatellite. 
However, the molecular architecture of the Xi chromosome, in both the silent and 
expressed regions,remains unclear. Here we investigate the structure, chromatin
accessibility and expression status of the mouse Xi chromosome in highly
polymorphic clonal neural progenitors (NPCs) and embryonic stem cells. We
demonstrate a crucial role for Xist and the DXZ4-containing boundary in shaping
Xi chromosome structure using allele-specific genome-wide chromosome conformation
capture (Hi-C) analysis, an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high 
throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing. Deletion of the boundary
disrupts mega-domain formation, and induction of Xist RNA initiates formation of 
the boundary and the loss of DNA accessibility. We also show that in NPCs, the Xi
chromosome lacks active/inactive compartments and topologically associating
domains (TADs), except around genes that escape XCI. Escapee gene clusters
display TAD-like structures and retain DNA accessibility at promoter-proximal and
CTCF-binding sites. Furthermore, altered patterns of facultative escape genes
indifferent neural progenitor clones are associated with the presence of
different TAD-like structures after XCI. These findings suggest a key role for
transcription and CTCF in the formation of TADs in the context of the Xi
chromosome in neural progenitors.

Indifference to dissonance in native Amazonians reveals cultural variation in
music perception.

Comment in
    Nature. 2016 Jul 28;535(7613):496-7.

by biology remains debated. One widely discussed phenomenon is that some
combinations of notes are perceived by Westerners as pleasant, or consonant,
whereas others are perceived as unpleasant,or dissonant. The contrast between
consonance and dissonance is central to Western music and its origins have
fascinated scholars since the ancient Greeks. Aesthetic responses to consonance
are commonly assumed by scientists to have biological roots, and thus to be
universally present in humans. Ethnomusicologists and composers, in contrast,
have argued that consonance is a creation of Western musical culture. The issue
has remained unresolved, partly because little is known about the extent of
cross-cultural variation in consonance preferences. Here we report experiments
with the Tsimane'--a native Amazonian society with minimal exposure to Western
culture--and comparison populations in Bolivia and the United States that varied 
in exposure to Western music. Participants rated the pleasantness of sounds.
Despite exhibiting Western-like discrimination abilities and Western-like
aesthetic responses to familiar sounds and acoustic roughness, the Tsimane' rated
consonant and dissonant chords and vocal harmonies as equally pleasant. By
contrast, Bolivian city- and town-dwellers exhibited significant preferences for 
consonance,albeit to a lesser degree than US residents. The results indicate that
consonance preferences can be absent in cultures sufficiently isolated from
Western music, and are thus unlikely to reflect innate biases or exposure to
harmonic natural sounds. The observed variation in preferences is presumably
determined by exposure to musical harmony, suggesting that culture has a dominant
role in shaping aesthetic responses to music.

Rapid signalling in distinct dopaminergic axons during locomotion and reward.

Howe MW, Dombeck DA.

Comment in
    Mov Disord. 2016 Oct;31(10 ):1481.

Dopaminergic projection axons from the midbrain to the striatum are crucial for
motor control, as their degeneration in Parkinson disease results in profound
movement deficits. Paradoxically, most recording methods report rapid phasic
dopamine signalling (~100-ms bursts) in response to unpredicted rewards, with
little evidence for movement-related signalling. The leading model posits that
phasic signalling in striatum-targeting dopamine neurons drives reward-based
learning, whereas slow variations in firing (tens of seconds to minutes) in these
same neurons bias animals towards or away from movement. However, current methods
have provided little evidence to support or refute this model. Here, using new
optical recording methods, we report the discovery of rapid phasic signalling in 
striatum-targeting dopaminergic axons that is associated with, and capable of
triggering, locomotion in mice. Axons expressing these signals were largely
distinct from those that responded to unexpected rewards. These results suggest
that dopaminergic neuromodulation can differentially impact motor control and
reward learning with sub-second precision, and indicate that both precise signal 
timing and neuronal subtype are important parameters to consider in the treatment
of dopamine-related disorders.

Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) shows extensive within population sequence
variability. Many studies suggest that mtDNA variants may be associated with
ageing or diseases, although mechanistic evidence at the molecular level is
lacking. Mitochondrial replacement has the potential to prevent transmission of
disease-causing oocyte mtDNA. However, extension of this technology requires a
comprehensive understanding of the physiological relevance of mtDNA sequence
variability and its match with the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. Studies
in conplastic animals allow comparison of individuals with the same nuclear
genome but different mtDNA variants, and have provided both supporting and
refuting evidence that mtDNA variation influences organismal physiology. However,
most of these studies did not confirm the conplastic status, focused on younger
animals, and did not investigate the full range of physiological and phenotypic
variability likely to be influenced by mitochondria. Here we systematically
characterized conplastic mice throughout their lifespan using transcriptomic,
proteomic,metabolomic, biochemical, physiological and phenotyping studies. We
show that mtDNA haplotype profoundly influences mitochondrial proteostasis and
reactive oxygen species generation,insulin signalling, obesity, and ageing
parameters including telomere shortening and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting
in profound differences in health longevity between conplastic strains.

High-resolution seismic constraints on flow dynamics in the oceanic
asthenosphere.

Lin PY, Gaherty JB, Jin G, Collins JA, Lizarralde D, Evans RL, Hirth G.

Convective flow in the mantle and the motions of tectonic plates produce
deformation of Earth's interior, and the rock fabric produced by this deformation
can be discerned using the anisotropy of the seismic wave speed. This deformation
is commonly inferred close to lithospheric boundaries beneath the ocean in the
uppermost mantle, including near seafloor-spreading centres as new plates are
formed via corner flow, and within a weak asthenosphere that lubricates
large-scale plate-driven flow and accommodates smaller scale convection. Seismic 
models of oceanic upper mantle differ as to the relative importance of these
deformation processes: seafloor spreading fabric is very strong just beneath the 
crust-mantle boundary (the Mohorovičić discontinuity, or Moho) at relatively
local scales, but at the global and ocean-basin scales, oceanic lithosphere
typically appears weakly anisotropic when compared to the asthenosphere. Here we 
use Rayleigh waves, recorded across an ocean-bottom seismograph array in the
central Pacific Ocean (the NoMelt Experiment), to provide unique localized
constraints on seismic anisotropy within the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere
system in the middle of a plate. We find that azimuthal anisotropy is strongest
within the high-seismic-velocity lid, with the fast direction coincident with
seafloor spreading. A minimum in the magnitude of azimuthal anisotropy occurs
within the middle of the seismic low-velocity zone, and then increases with depth
below the weakest portion of the asthenosphere. At no depth does the fast
direction correlate with the apparent plate motion. Our results suggest that the 
highest strain deformation in the shallow oceanic mantle occurs during corner
flow at the ridge axis, and via pressure-driven or buoyancy-driven flow within
the asthenosphere. Shear associated with motion of the plate over the underlying 
asthenosphere, if present, is weak compared to these other processes.

Suppression of star formation in dwarf galaxies by photoelectric grain heating
feedback.

Forbes JC, Krumholz MR, Goldbaum NJ, Dekel A.

Photoelectric heating--heating of dust grains by far-ultraviolet photons--has
long been recognized as the primary source of heating for the neutral
interstellar medium. Simulations of spiral galaxies have shown some indication
that photoelectric heating could suppress star formation; however, simulations
that include photoelectric heating have typically shown that it has little effect
on the rate of star formation in either spiral galaxies or dwarf galaxies, which 
suggests that supernovae are responsible for setting the gas depletion time in
galaxies. This result is in contrast with recent work indicating that a star
formation law that depends on galaxy metallicity--as is expected with
photoelectric heating,but not with supernovae--reproduces the present-day galaxy 
population better than does a metallicity-independent one. Here we report a
series of simulations of dwarf galaxies, the class of galaxy in which the effects
of both photoelectric heating and supernovae are expected to be strongest. We
simultaneously include space and time-dependent photoelectric heating in our
simulations, and we resolve the energy-conserving phase of every supernova blast 
wave, which allows us to directly measure the relative importance of feedback by 
supernovae and photoelectric heating in suppressing star formation. We find that 
supernovae are unable to account for the observed large gas depletion times in
dwarf galaxies. Instead, photoelectric heating is the dominant means by which
dwarf galaxies regulate their star formation rate at any given time,suppressing
the rate by more than an order of magnitude relative to simulations with only
supernovae.

Interruption of combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals 
leads to rapid viral rebound. Here we report the results of a phase IIa open
label clinical trial evaluating 3BNC117,a broad and potent neutralizing antibody 
against the CD4 binding site of the HIV-1 Env protein, during analytical
treatment interruption in 13 HIV-1-infected individuals. Participants with
3BNC117-sensitive virus outgrowth cultures were enrolled. Results show that two
or four 30 mg kg(-1) 3BNC117 infusions,separated by 3 or 2 weeks, respectively,
are generally well tolerated.Infusions are associated with a delay in viral
rebound of 5-9 weeks after two infusions, and up to 19 weeks after four
infusions, or an average of 6.7 and 9.9 weeks, respectively, compared with 2.6
weeks for historical controls (P < 0.00001). Rebound viruses arise predominantly 
from a single provirus. In most individuals,emerging viruses show increased
resistance, indicating escape.However, 30% of participants remained suppressed
until antibody concentrations waned below 20 μg ml(-1), and the viruses emerging 
in all but one of these individuals showed no apparent resistance to 3BCN117,
suggesting failure to escape over a period of 9-19 weeks.We conclude that the
administration of 3BNC117 exerts strong selective pressure on HIV-1 emerging from
latent reservoirs during analytical treatment interruption in humans.

Since the 1950s, research stations on the Antarctic Peninsula have recorded some 
of the largest increases in near-surface air temperature in the Southern
Hemisphere. This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers,
disintegration of floating ice shelves and a 'greening' through the expansion in 
range of various flora. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as
contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion, local
sea-ice loss, an increase in westerly winds, and changes in the strength and
location of low-high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections. Here we use a stacked 
temperature record to show an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s.
The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate,
with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have
decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly 
winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea
associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have 
also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, 
amplifying their effects. Our findings cover only 1% of the Antarctic continent
and emphasize that decadal temperature changes in this region are not primarily
associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the
extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation.

One of the defining properties of electrons is their mutual Coulomb repulsion.
However, in solids this basic property may change; for example, in
superconductors, the coupling of electrons to lattice vibrations makes the
electrons attract one another, leading to the formation of bound pairs. Fifty
years ago it was proposed that electrons can be made attractive even when all of 
the degrees of freedom in the solid are electronic, by exploiting their repulsion
from other electrons. This attraction mechanism, termed 'excitonic', promised to 
achieve stronger and more exotic superconductivity. Yet, despite an extensive
search, experimental evidence for excitonic attraction has yet to be found. Here 
we demonstrate this attraction by constructing, from the bottom up, the
fundamental building block of the excitonic mechanism. Our experiments are based 
on quantum devices made from pristine carbon nanotubes, combined with cryogenic
precision manipulation. Using this platform, we demonstrate that two electrons
can be made to attract each other using an independent electronic system as the
'glue' that mediates attraction. Owing to its tunability, our system offers
insights into the underlying physics, such as the dependence of the emergent
attraction on the underlying repulsion, and the origin of the pairing energy. We 
also demonstrate transport signatures of excitonic pairing. This experimental
demonstration of excitonic pairing paves the way for the design of exotic states 
of matter.

Rimmed grooves, lineations and elongate craters around Mare Imbrium shape much of
the nearside Moon. This pattern was coined the Imbrium Sculpture, and it was
originally argued that it must have been formed by a giant oblique (~30°) impact,
a conclusion echoed by later studies. Some investigators, however, noticed that
many elements of the Imbrium Sculpture are not radial to Imbrium, thereby
implicating an endogenic or structural origin. Here we use these non-radial
trends to conclude that the Imbrium impactor was a proto-planet (half the
diameter of Vesta), once part of a population of large proto-planets in the
asteroid belt. Such independent constraints on the sizes of the Imbrium and other
basin-forming impactors markedly increase estimates for the mass in the asteroid 
belt before depletion caused by the orbital migration of Jupiter and Saturn.
Moreover, laboratory impact experiments, shock physics codes and the groove
widths indicate that multiple fragments (up to 2% of the initial diameter) from
each oblique basin-forming impactor, such as the one that formed Imbrium, should 
have survived planetary collisions and contributed to the heavy impact
bombardment between 4.3 and 3.8 billion years ago.

Cells deficient in the Brca1 and Brca2 genes have reduced capacity to repair DNA 
double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and consequently are
hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents, including cisplatin and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Here we show that loss of the MLL3/4 complex
protein, PTIP, protects Brca1/2-deficient cells from DNA damage and rescues the
lethality of Brca2-deficient embryonic stem cells. However, PTIP deficiency does 
not restore homologous recombination activity at double-strand breaks. Instead,
its absence inhibits the recruitment of the MRE11 nuclease to stalled replication
forks, which in turn protects nascent DNA strands from extensive degradation.
More generally, acquisition of PARP inhibitors and cisplatin resistance is
associated with replication fork protection in Brca2-deficient tumour cells that 
do not develop Brca2 reversion mutations. Disruption of multiple proteins,
including PARP1 and CHD4, leads to the same end point of replication fork
protection, highlighting the complexities by which tumour cells evade
chemotherapeutic interventions and acquire drug resistance.

Immune dysfunction is commonly associated with several neurological and mental
disorders. Although the mechanisms by which peripheral immunity may influence
neuronal function are largely unknown, recent findings implicate meningeal
immunity influencing behaviour, such as spatial learning and memory. Here we show
that meningeal immunity is also critical for social behaviour; mice deficient in 
adaptive immunity exhibit social deficits and hyper-connectivity of
fronto-cortical brain regions. Associations between rodent transcriptomes from
brain and cellular transcriptomes in response to T-cell-derived cytokines suggest
a strong interaction between social behaviour and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-driven
responses. Concordantly, we demonstrate that inhibitory neurons respond to IFN-γ 
and increase GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid) currents in projection neurons,
suggesting that IFN-γ is a molecular link between meningeal immunity and neural
circuits recruited for social behaviour. Meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of a
range of organisms reveals that rodents, fish, and flies elevate
IFN-γ/JAK-STAT-dependent gene signatures in a social context, suggesting that the
IFN-γ signalling pathway could mediate a co-evolutionary link between
social/aggregation behaviour and an efficient anti-pathogen response. This study 
implicates adaptive immune dysfunction, in particular IFN-γ, in disorders
characterized by social dysfunction and suggests a co-evolutionary link between

G-protein-coupled receptor activation.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate many physiological processes by
transducing a variety of extracellular cues into intracellular responses. Ligand 
binding to an extracellular orthosteric pocket propagates conformational change
to the receptor cytosolic region to promote binding and activation of downstream 
signalling effectors such as G proteins and β-arrestins. It is well known that
different agonists can share the same binding pocket but evoke unique receptor
conformations leading to a wide range of downstream responses (‘efficacy’).
Furthermore, increasing biophysical evidence, primarily using the β2-adrenergic
receptor (β2AR) as a model system, supports the existence of multiple active and 
inactive conformational states. However, how agonists with varying efficacy
modulate these receptor states to initiate cellular responses is not well
understood. Here we report stabilization of two distinct β2AR conformations using
single domain camelid antibodies (nanobodies)—a previously described positive
allosteric nanobody (Nb80) and a newly identified negative allosteric nanobody
(Nb60). We show that Nb60 stabilizes a previously unappreciated low-affinity
receptor state which corresponds to one of two inactive receptor conformations as
delineated by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. We find that the
agonist isoprenaline has a 15,000-fold higher affinity for β2AR in the presence
of Nb80 compared to the affinity of isoprenaline for β2AR in the presence of
Nb60, highlighting the full allosteric range of a GPCR. Assessing the binding of 
17 ligands of varying efficacy to the β2AR in the absence and presence of Nb60 or
Nb80 reveals large ligand-specific effects that can only be explained using an
allosteric model which assumes equilibrium amongst at least three receptor
states. Agonists generally exert efficacy by stabilizing the active
Nb80-stabilized receptor state (R80). In contrast, for a number of partial
agonists, both stabilization of R80 and destabilization of the inactive,
Nb60-bound state (R60) contribute to their ability to modulate receptor
activation. These data demonstrate that ligands can initiate a wide range of
cellular responses by differentially stabilizing multiple receptor states.

Insulin resistance is a forerunner state of ischaemic cardiovascular disease and 
type 2 diabetes. Here we show how the human gut microbiome impacts the serum
metabolome and associates with insulin resistance in 277 non-diabetic Danish
individuals. The serum metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals is
characterized by increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which
correlate with a gut microbiome that has an enriched biosynthetic potential for
BCAAs and is deprived of genes encoding bacterial inward transporters for these
amino acids. Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus are identified as the main
species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs and insulin
resistance, and in mice we demonstrate that P. copri can induce insulin
resistance, aggravate glucose intolerance and augment circulating levels of
BCAAs. Our findings suggest that microbial targets may have the potential to
diminish insulin resistance and reduce the incidence of common metabolic and
cardiovascular disorders.

The transcriptional underpinnings of brain development remain poorly understood, 
particularly in humans and closely related non-human primates. We describe a
high-resolution transcriptional atlas of rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) brain
development that combines dense temporal sampling of prenatal and postnatal
periods with fine anatomical division of cortical and subcortical regions
associated with human neuropsychiatric disease. Gene expression changes more
rapidly before birth, both in progenitor cells and maturing neurons. Cortical
layers and areas acquire adult-like molecular profiles surprisingly late in
postnatal development. Disparate cell populations exhibit distinct developmental 
timing of gene expression, but also unexpected synchrony of processes underlying 
neural circuit construction including cell projection and adhesion. Candidate
risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders including primary microcephaly,
autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia show
disease-specific spatiotemporal enrichment within developing neocortex. Human
developmental expression trajectories are more similar to monkey than rodent,
although approximately 9% of genes show human-specific regulation with evidence
for prolonged maturation or neoteny compared to monkey.

Prefrontal neuronal assemblies temporally control fear behaviour.

Dejean C, Courtin J, Karalis N, Chaudun F, Wurtz H, Bienvenu TC, Herry C.

Precise spike timing through the coordination and synchronization of neuronal
assemblies is an efficient and flexible coding mechanism for sensory and
cognitive processing. In cortical and subcortical areas, the formation of cell
assemblies critically depends on neuronal oscillations, which can precisely
control the timing of spiking activity. Whereas this form of coding has been
described for sensory processing and spatial learning, its role in encoding
emotional behaviour remains unknown. Fear behaviour relies on the activation of
distributed structures, among which the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
is known to be critical for fear memory expression. In the dmPFC, the phasic
activation of neurons to threat-predicting cues, a spike-rate coding mechanism,
correlates with conditioned fear responses and supports the discrimination
between aversive and neutral stimuli. However, this mechanism does not account
for freezing observed outside stimuli presentations, and the contribution of a
general spike-time coding mechanism for freezing in the dmPFC remains to be
established. Here we use a combination of single-unit and local field potential
recordings along with optogenetic manipulations to show that, in the dmPFC,
expression of conditioned fear is causally related to the organization of neurons
into functional assemblies. During fear behaviour, the development of 4 Hz
oscillations coincides with the activation of assemblies nested in the ascending 
phase of the oscillation. The selective optogenetic inhibition of dmPFC neurons
during the ascending or descending phases of this oscillation blocks and promotes
conditioned fear responses, respectively. These results identify a novel
phase-specific coding mechanism, which dynamically regulates the development of
dmPFC assemblies to control the precise timing of fear responses.

Recent work has underscored the importance of the microbiome in human health, and
has largely attributed differences in phenotype to differences in the species
present among individuals. However, mobile genes can confer profoundly different 
phenotypes on different strains of the same species. Little is known about the
function and distribution of mobile genes in the human microbiome, and in
particular whether the gene pool is globally homogenous or constrained by human
population structure. Here, we investigate this question by comparing the mobile 
genes found in the microbiomes of 81 metropolitan North Americans with those of
172 agrarian Fiji islanders using a combination of single-cell genomics and
metagenomics. We find large differences in mobile gene content between the Fijian
and North American microbiomes, with functional variation that mirrors known
dietary differences such as the excess of plant-based starch degradation genes
found in Fijian individuals. Notably, we also observed differences between the
mobile gene pools of neighbouring Fijian villages, even though microbiome
composition across villages is similar. Finally, we observe high rates of
recombination leading to individual-specific mobile elements, suggesting that the
abundance of some genes may reflect environmental selection rather than dispersal
limitation. Together, these data support the hypothesis that human activities and
behaviours provide selective pressures that shape mobile gene pools, and that
acquisition of mobile genes is important for colonizing specific human
populations.

Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) are major regulators of inflammation and
infection at mucosal barriers. ILC3 development is thought to be programmed, but 
how ILC3 perceive, integrate and respond to local environmental signals remains
unclear. Here we show that ILC3 in mice sense their environment and control gut
defence as part of a glial–ILC3–epithelial cell unit orchestrated by neurotrophic
factors. We found that enteric ILC3 express the neuroregulatory receptor RET.
ILC3-autonomous Ret ablation led to decreased innate interleukin-22 (IL-22),
impaired epithelial reactivity, dysbiosis and increased susceptibility to bowel
inflammation and infection. Neurotrophic factors directly controlled innate Il22 
downstream of the p38 MAPK/ERK-AKT cascade and STAT3 activation. Notably, ILC3
were adjacent to neurotrophic-factor-expressing glial cells that exhibited
stellate-shaped projections into ILC3 aggregates. Glial cells sensed
microenvironmental cues in a MYD88-dependent manner to control neurotrophic
factors and innate IL-22. Accordingly, glial-intrinsic Myd88 deletion led to
impaired production of ILC3-derived IL-22 and a pronounced propensity towards gut
inflammation and infection. Our work sheds light on a novel multi-tissue defence 
unit, revealing that glial cells are central hubs of neuron and innate immune
regulation by neurotrophic factor signals.

Insulin-dependent diabetes is a complex multifactorial disorder characterized by 
loss or dysfunction of β-cells. Pancreatic β-cells differ in size, glucose
responsiveness, insulin secretion and precursor cell potential; understanding the
mechanisms that underlie this functional heterogeneity might make it possible to 
develop new regenerative approaches. Here we show that Fltp (also known as
Flattop and Cfap126), a Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) effector and reporter gene
acts as a marker gene that subdivides endocrine cells into two subpopulations and
distinguishes proliferation-competent from mature β-cells with distinct
molecular, physiological and ultrastructural features. Genetic lineage tracing
revealed that endocrine subpopulations from Fltp-negative and -positive lineages 
react differently to physiological and pathological changes. The expression of
Fltp increases when endocrine cells cluster together to form polarized and mature
3D islet mini-organs. We show that 3D architecture and Wnt/PCP ligands are
sufficient to trigger β-cell maturation. By contrast, the Wnt/PCP effector Fltp
is not necessary for β-cell development, proliferation or maturation. We conclude
that 3D architecture and Wnt/PCP signalling underlie functional β-cell
heterogeneity and induce β-cell maturation. The identification of Fltp as a
marker for endocrine subpopulations sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of
islet cell heterogeneity and plasticity and might enable targeting of endocrine
subpopulations for the regeneration of functional β-cell mass in diabetic
patients.

Engineering and mapping nanocavity emission via precision placement of DNA
origami.

Gopinath A, Miyazono E, Faraon A, Rothemund PW.

Many hybrid devices integrate functional molecular or nanoparticle components
with microstructures, as exemplified by the nanophotonic devices that couple
emitters to optical resonators for potential use in single-molecule detection,
precision magnetometry low threshold lasing and quantum information processing.
These systems also illustrate a common difficulty for hybrid devices: although
many proof-of-principle devices exist, practical applications face the challenge 
of how to incorporate large numbers of chemically diverse functional components
into microfabricated resonators at precise locations. Here we show that the
directed self-assembly of DNA origami onto lithographically patterned binding
sites allows reliable and controllable coupling of molecular emitters to photonic
crystal cavities (PCCs). The precision of this method is sufficient to enable us 
to visualize the local density of states within PCCs by simple wide-field
microscopy and to resolve the antinodes of the cavity mode at a resolution of
about one-tenth of a wavelength. By simply changing the number of binding sites, 
we program the delivery of up to seven DNA origami onto distinct antinodes within
a single cavity and thereby digitally vary the intensity of the cavity emission. 
To demonstrate the scalability of our technique, we fabricate 65,536
independently programmed PCCs on a single chip. These features, in combination
with the widely used modularity of DNA origami, suggest that our method is well
suited for the rapid prototyping of a broad array of hybrid nanophotonic devices.

The chemical nature of the 5′ end of RNA is a key determinant of RNA stability,
processing, localization and translation efficiency, and has been proposed to
provide a layer of ‘epitranscriptomic’ gene regulation. Recently it has been
shown that some bacterial RNA species carry a 5′-end structure reminiscent of the
5′ 7-methylguanylate ‘cap’ in eukaryotic RNA. In particular, RNA species
containing a 5′-end nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) or
3′-desphospho-coenzyme A (dpCoA) have been identified in both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria. It has been proposed that NAD+, reduced NAD+ (NADH) and
dpCoA caps are added to RNA after transcription initiation, in a manner analogous
to the addition of 7-methylguanylate caps. Here we show instead that NAD+, NADH
and dpCoA are incorporated into RNA during transcription initiation, by serving
as non-canonical initiating nucleotides (NCINs) for de novo transcription
initiation by cellular RNA polymerase (RNAP). We further show that both bacterial
RNAP and eukaryotic RNAP II incorporate NCIN caps, that promoter DNA sequences at
and upstream of the transcription start site determine the efficiency of NCIN
capping, that NCIN capping occurs in vivo, and that NCIN capping has functional
consequences. We report crystal structures of transcription initiation complexes 
containing NCIN-capped RNA products. Our results define the mechanism and
structural basis of NCIN capping, and suggest that NCIN-mediated ‘ab initio
capping’ may occur in all organisms.

Cooperative electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation with electron-proton-transfer
mediators.

Badalyan A, Stahl SS.

The electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is a major focus of energy and chemical
conversion efforts, with potential applications ranging from fuel cells to
biomass utilization and fine-chemical synthesis. Small-molecule electrocatalysts 
for processes of this type are promising targets for further development, as
demonstrated by recent advances in nickel catalysts for electrochemical
production and oxidation of hydrogen. Complexes with tethered amines that
resemble the active site of hydrogenases have been shown both to catalyse
hydrogen production (from protons and electrons) with rates far exceeding those
of such enzymes and to mediate reversible electrocatalytic hydrogen production
and oxidation with enzyme-like performance. Progress in electrocatalytic alcohol 
oxidation has been more modest. Nickel complexes similar to those used for
hydrogen oxidation have been shown to mediate efficient electrochemical oxidation
of benzyl alcohol, with a turnover frequency of 2.1 per second. These compounds
exhibit poor reactivity with ethanol and methanol, however. Organic nitroxyls,
such as TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidine N-oxyl), are the most widely
studied electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation. These catalysts exhibit good
activity (1–2 turnovers per second) with a wide range of alcohols and have great 
promise for electro-organic synthesis. Their use in energy-conversion
applications, however, is limited by the high electrode potentials required to
generate the reactive oxoammonium species. Here we report
(2,2′-bipyridine)Cu/nitroxyl co-catalyst systems for electrochemical alcohol
oxidation that proceed with much faster rates, while operating at an electrode
potential a half-volt lower than that used for the TEMPO-only process. The
(2,2′-bipyridine)Cu(II) and TEMPO redox partners exhibit cooperative reactivity
and exploit the low-potential, proton-coupled TEMPO/TEMPOH redox process rather
than the high-potential TEMPO/TEMPO+ process. The results show how
electron-proton-transfer mediators, such as TEMPO, may be used in combination
with first-row transition metals, such as copper, to achieve efficient
two-electron electrochemical processes, thereby introducing a new concept for the
development of non-precious-metal electrocatalysts.

Relativistic reverberation in the accretion flow of a tidal disruption event.

Kara E, Miller JM, Reynolds C, Dai L.

Our current understanding of the curved space-time around supermassive black
holes is based on actively accreting black holes, which make up only ten per cent
or less of the overall population. X-ray observations of that small fraction
reveal strong gravitational redshifts that indicate that many of these black
holes are rapidly rotating; however, selection biases suggest that these results 
are not necessarily reflective of the majority of black holes in the Universe.
Tidal disruption events, where a star orbiting an otherwise dormant black hole
gets tidally shredded and accreted onto the black hole, can provide a short,
unbiased glimpse at the space-time around the other ninety per cent of black
holes. Observations of tidal disruptions have hitherto revealed the formation of 
an accretion disk and the onset of an accretion-powered jet, but have failed to
reveal emission from the inner accretion flow, which enables the measurement of
black hole spin. Here we report observations of reverberation arising from
gravitationally redshifted iron Kα photons reflected off the inner accretion flow
in the tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. From the reverberation timescale,
we estimate the mass of the black hole to be a few million solar masses,
suggesting an accretion rate of 100 times the Eddington limit or more. The
detection of reverberation from the relativistic depths of this rare
super-Eddington event demonstrates that the X-rays do not arise from the
relativistically moving regions of a jet, as previously thought.

Ongoing declines in the structure and function of the world’s coral reefs require
novel approaches to sustain these ecosystems and the millions of people who
depend on them3. A presently unexplored approach that draws on theory and
practice in human health and rural development is to systematically identify and 
learn from the ‘outliers’—places where ecosystems are substantially better
(‘bright spots’) or worse (‘dark spots’) than expected, given the environmental
conditions and socioeconomic drivers they are exposed to. Here we compile data
from more than 2,500 reefs worldwide and develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to
generate expectations of how standing stocks of reef fish biomass are related to 
18 socioeconomic drivers and environmental conditions. We identify 15 bright
spots and 35 dark spots among our global survey of coral reefs, defined as sites 
that have biomass levels more than two standard deviations from expectations.
Importantly, bright spots are not simply comprised of remote areas with low
fishing pressure; they include localities where human populations and use of
ecosystem resources is high, potentially providing insights into how communities 
have successfully confronted strong drivers of change. Conversely, dark spots are
not necessarily the sites with the lowest absolute biomass and even include some 
remote, uninhabited locations often considered near pristine6. We surveyed local 
experts about social, institutional, and environmental conditions at these sites 
to reveal that bright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural
institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local
engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial
environmental conditions such as deep-water refuges. Alternatively, dark spots
are characterized by intensive capture and storage technology and a recent

strengthening fisheries governance, particularly aspects such as participation
and property rights, could facilitate innovative conservation actions that help
communities defy expectations of global reef degradation.

The mechanisms underlying haematopoietic lineage decisions remain disputed.
Lineage-affiliated transcription factors with the capacity for lineage
reprogramming, positive auto-regulation and mutual inhibition have been described
as being expressed in uncommitted cell populations. This led to the assumption
that lineage choice is cell-intrinsically initiated and determined by stochastic 
switches of randomly fluctuating cross-antagonistic transcription factors.
However, this hypothesis was developed on the basis of RNA expression data from
snapshot and/or population-averaged analyses. Alternative models of lineage
choice therefore cannot be excluded. Here we use novel reporter mouse lines and
live imaging for continuous single-cell long-term quantification of the
transcription factors GATA1 and PU.1 (also known as SPI1). We analyse individual 
haematopoietic stem cells throughout differentiation into
megakaryocytic-erythroid and granulocytic-monocytic lineages. The observed
expression dynamics are incompatible with the assumption that stochastic
switching between PU.1 and GATA1 precedes and initiates megakaryocytic-erythroid 
versus granulocytic-monocytic lineage decision-making. Rather, our findings
suggest that these transcription factors are only executing and reinforcing
lineage choice once made. These results challenge the current prevailing model of
early myeloid lineage choice.

Vascular and haematopoietic cells organize into specialized tissues during early 
embryogenesis to supply essential nutrients to all organs and thus play critical 
roles in development and disease. At the top of the haemato-vascular
specification cascade lies cloche, a gene that when mutated in zebrafish leads to
the striking phenotype of loss of most endothelial and haematopoietic cells and a
significant increase in cardiomyocyte numbers. Although this mutant has been
analysed extensively to investigate mesoderm diversification and differentiation 
and continues to be broadly used as a unique avascular model, the isolation of
the cloche gene has been challenging due to its telomeric location. Here we used 
a deletion allele of cloche to identify several new cloche candidate genes within
this genomic region, and systematically genome-edited each candidate. Through
this comprehensive interrogation, we succeeded in isolating the cloche gene and
discovered that it encodes a PAS-domain-containing bHLH transcription factor, and
that it is expressed in a highly specific spatiotemporal pattern starting during 
late gastrulation. Gain-of-function experiments show that it can potently induce 
endothelial gene expression. Epistasis experiments reveal that it functions
upstream of etv2 and tal1, the earliest expressed endothelial and haematopoietic 
transcription factor genes identified to date. A mammalian cloche orthologue can 
also rescue blood vessel formation in zebrafish cloche mutants, indicating a
highly conserved role in vertebrate vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis. The
identification of this master regulator of endothelial and haematopoietic fate
enhances our understanding of early mesoderm diversification and may lead to
improved protocols for the generation of endothelial and haematopoietic cells in 
vivo and in vitro.

Graphene and related two-dimensional materials have shown unusual and exceptional
mechanical properties, with similarities to origami-like paper folding and
kirigami-like cutting demonstrated. For paper analogues, a critical difference
between macroscopic sheets and a two-dimensional solid is the molecular scale of 
the thin dimension of the latter, allowing the thermal activation of considerable
out-of-plane motion. So far thermal activity has been shown to produce local
wrinkles in a free graphene sheet that help in theoretically understanding its
stability, for example, and give rise to unexpected long-range bending stiffness.
Here we show that thermal activation can have a more marked effect on the
behaviour of two-dimensional solids, leading to spontaneous and self-driven
sliding, tearing and peeling from a substrate on scales approaching the
macroscopic. We demonstrate that scalable nanoimprint-style contact techniques
can nucleate and direct the parallel self-assembly of graphene ribbons of
controlled shape in ambient conditions. We interpret our observations through a
simple fracture-mechanics model that shows how thermodynamic forces drive the
formation of the graphene-graphene interface in lieu of substrate contact with
sufficient strength to peel and tear multilayer graphene sheets. Our results show
how weak physical surface forces can be harnessed and focused by simple folded
configurations of graphene to tear the strongest covalent bond. This effect may
hold promise for the patterning and mechanical actuating of devices based on
two-dimensional materials.

Fundamental quantum fluctuations caused by the Heisenberg principle limit
measurement precision. If the uncertainty is distributed equally between
conjugate variables of the meter system, the measurement precision cannot exceed 
the standard quantum limit. When the meter is a large angular momentum, going
beyond the standard quantum limit requires non-classical states such as squeezed 
states or Schrödinger-cat-like states. However, the metrological use of the
latter has been so far restricted to meters with a relatively small total angular
momentum because the experimental preparation of these non-classical states is
very challenging. Here we report a measurement of an electric field based on an
electrometer consisting of a large angular momentum (quantum number J ≈ 25)
carried by a single atom in a high-energy Rydberg state. We show that the
fundamental Heisenberg limit can be approached when the Rydberg atom undergoes a 
non-classical evolution through Schrödinger-cat states. Using this method, we
reach a single-shot sensitivity of 1.2 millivolts per centimetre for a
100-nanosecond interaction time, corresponding to 30 microvolts per centimetre
per square root hertz at our 3 kilohertz repetition rate. This highly sensitive, 
non-invasive space- and time-resolved field measurement extends the realm of
electrometric techniques and could have important practical applications:
detection of individual electrons in mesoscopic devices at a distance of about
100 micrometres with a megahertz bandwidth is within reach.

A snow-line is the region of a protoplanetary disk at which a major volatile,
such as water or carbon monoxide, reaches its condensation temperature.
Snow-lines play a crucial role in disk evolution by promoting the rapid growth of
ice-covered grains. Signatures of the carbon monoxide snow-line (at temperatures 
of around 20 kelvin) have recently been imaged in the disks surrounding the
pre-main-sequence stars TW Hydra and HD163296 (refs 3, 10), at distances of about
30 astronomical units (au) from the star. But the water snow-line of a
protoplanetary disk (at temperatures of more than 100 kelvin) has not hitherto
been seen, as it generally lies very close to the star (less than 5 au away for
solar-type stars). Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency of 
dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants and
the cores of gas giants. Here we report images at 0.03-arcsec resolution (12 au) 
of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of 1.3 solar masses that 
is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a temporary increase in the 
accretion rate. We find an intensity break corresponding to an abrupt change in
the optical depth at about 42 au, where the elevated disk temperature approaches 
the condensation point of water, from which we conclude that the outburst has
moved the water snow-line. The spectral behaviour across the snow-line confirms
recent model predictions: dust fragmentation and the inhibition of grain growth
at higher temperatures results in soaring grain number densities and optical
depths. As most planetary systems are expected to experience outbursts caused by 
accretion during their formation, our results imply that highly dynamical water
snow-lines must be considered when developing models of disk evolution and planet
formation.

Butterflies rely extensively on colour vision to adapt to the natural world. Most
species express a broad range of colour-sensitive Rhodopsin proteins in three
types of ommatidia (unit eyes), which are distributed stochastically across the
retina. The retinas of Drosophila melanogaster use just two main types, in which 
fate is controlled by the binary stochastic decision to express the transcription
factor Spineless in R7 photoreceptors. We investigated how butterflies instead
generate three stochastically distributed ommatidial types, resulting in a more
diverse retinal mosaic that provides the basis for additional colour comparisons 
and an expanded range of colour vision. We show that the Japanese yellow
swallowtail (Papilio xuthus, Papilionidae) and the painted lady (Vanessa cardui, 
Nymphalidae) butterflies have a second R7-like photoreceptor in each ommatidium. 
Independent stochastic expression of Spineless in each R7-like cell results in
expression of a blue-sensitive (Spineless(ON)) or an ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive
(Spineless(OFF)) Rhodopsin. In P. xuthus these choices of blue/blue, blue/UV or
UV/UV sensitivity in the two R7 cells are coordinated with expression of
additional Rhodopsin proteins in the remaining photoreceptors, and together
define the three types of ommatidia. Knocking out spineless using CRISPR/Cas9
(refs 5, 6) leads to the loss of the blue-sensitive fate in R7-like cells and
transforms retinas into homogeneous fields of UV/UV-type ommatidia, with
corresponding changes in other coordinated features of ommatidial type. Hence,
the three possible outcomes of Spineless expression define the three ommatidial
types in butterflies. This developmental strategy allowed the deployment of an
additional red-sensitive Rhodopsin in P. xuthus, allowing for the evolution of
expanded colour vision with a greater variety of receptors. This surprisingly
simple mechanism that makes use of two binary stochastic decisions coupled with
local coordination may prove to be a general means of generating an increased
diversity of developmental outcomes.

Cellular mechanisms that mediate steatohepatitis, an increasingly prevalent
condition in the Western world for which no therapies are available, are poorly
understood. Despite the fact that its synthetic agonists induce fatty liver, the 
liver X receptor (LXR) transcription factor remains a target of interest because 
of its anti-atherogenic, cholesterol removal, and anti-inflammatory activities.
Here we show that tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein 39B (Ttc39b, C9orf52)
(T39), a high-density lipoprotein gene discovered in human genome-wide
association studies, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of LXR. Chow-fed
mice lacking T39 (T39(-/-)) display increased high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels associated with increased enterocyte ATP-binding cassette
transporter A1 (Abca1) expression and increased LXR protein without change in LXR
messenger RNA. When challenged with a high fat/high cholesterol/bile salt diet,
T39(-/-) mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific T39 deficiency show increased
hepatic LXR protein and target gene expression, and unexpectedly protection from 
steatohepatitis and death. Mice fed a Western-type diet and lacking low-density
lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr(-/-)T39(-/-)) show decreased fatty liver, increased
high-density lipoprotein, decreased low-density lipoprotein, and reduced
atherosclerosis. In addition to increasing hepatic Abcg5/8 expression and
limiting dietary cholesterol absorption, T39 deficiency inhibits hepatic sterol
regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1, ADD1) processing. This is
explained by an increase in microsomal phospholipids containing polyunsaturated
fatty acids, linked to an LXRα-dependent increase in expression of enzymes
mediating phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and incorporation of polyunsaturated
fatty acids into phospholipids. The preservation of endogenous LXR protein
activates a beneficial profile of gene expression that promotes cholesterol
removal and inhibits lipogenesis. T39 inhibition could be an effective strategy
for reducing both steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis.

Poor prognosis in neuroblastoma is associated with genetic amplification of MYCN.
MYCN is itself a target of let-7, a tumour suppressor family of microRNAs
implicated in numerous cancers. LIN28B, an inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis, is
overexpressed in neuroblastoma and has been reported to regulate MYCN. Here we
show, however, that LIN28B is dispensable in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell
lines, despite de-repression of let-7. We further demonstrate that MYCN messenger
RNA levels in amplified disease are exceptionally high and sufficient to sponge
let-7, which reconciles the dispensability of LIN28B. We found that genetic loss 
of let-7 is common in neuroblastoma, inversely associated with MYCN
amplification, and independently associated with poor outcomes, providing a
rationale for chromosomal loss patterns in neuroblastoma. We propose that let-7
disruption by LIN28B, MYCN sponging, or genetic loss is a unifying mechanism of
neuroblastoma development with broad implications for cancer pathogenesis.

In mammals, specification of the three major germ layers occurs during
gastrulation, when cells ingressing through the primitive streak differentiate
into the precursor cells of major organ systems. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear, as numbers of gastrulating
cells are very limited. In the mouse embryo at embryonic day 6.5, cells located
at the junction between the extra-embryonic region and the epiblast on the
posterior side of the embryo undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and 
ingress through the primitive streak. Subsequently, cells migrate, either
surrounding the prospective ectoderm contributing to the embryo proper, or into
the extra-embryonic region to form the yolk sac, umbilical cord and placenta.
Fate mapping has shown that mature tissues such as blood and heart originate from
specific regions of the pre-gastrula epiblast, but the plasticity of cells within
the embryo and the function of key cell-type-specific transcription factors
remain unclear. Here we analyse 1,205 cells from the epiblast and nascent Flk1(+)
mesoderm of gastrulating mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing,
representing the first transcriptome-wide in vivo view of early mesoderm
formation during mammalian gastrulation. Additionally, using knockout mice, we
study the function of Tal1, a key haematopoietic transcription factor, and
demonstrate, contrary to previous studies performed using retrospective assays,
that Tal1 knockout does not immediately bias precursor cells towards a cardiac
fate.

The dispersion of charge carriers in a metal is distinctly different from that of
free electrons owing to their interactions with the crystal lattice. These
interactions may lead to quasiparticles mimicking the massless relativistic
dynamics of high-energy particle physics, and they can twist the quantum phase of
electrons into topologically non-trivial knots-producing protected surface states
with anomalous electromagnetic properties. These effects intertwine in materials 
known as Weyl semimetals, and in their crystal-symmetry-protected analogues,
Dirac semimetals. The latter show a linear electronic dispersion in three
dimensions described by two copies of the Weyl equation (a theoretical
description of massless relativistic fermions). At the surface of a crystal, the 
broken translational symmetry creates topological surface states, so-called Fermi
arcs, which have no counterparts in high-energy physics or conventional condensed
matter systems. Here we present Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in
focused-ion-beam-prepared microstructures of Cd3As2 that are consistent with the 
theoretically predicted 'Weyl orbits', a kind of cyclotron motion that weaves
together Fermi-arc and chiral bulk states. In contrast to conventional cyclotron 
orbits, this motion is driven by the transfer of chirality from one Weyl node to 
another, rather than momentum transfer of the Lorentz force. Our observations
provide evidence for direct access to the topological properties of charge in a
transport experiment, a first step towards their potential application.

During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses that 
are correlated with decisions. However, it remains uncertain whether or not
various forms of decision-related activity are causally related to decision
making. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly inactivating
the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques
performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited 
firing rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process
posited to govern decision making, with strong correlations between their
response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast, 
exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and choices, and 
had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding.
The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely
related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of
neurons in MT profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP
had no measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced 
the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP
inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial
selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an
effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions and was 
robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry, arguing against several
forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be 
critical for computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary
processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and
causation, showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily
offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.

Mid-ocean-ridge seismicity reveals extreme types of ocean lithosphere.

Alten Hafen 26, 27568 Bremerhaven, Germany.

Along ultraslow-spreading ridges, where oceanic tectonic plates drift very slowly
apart, conductive cooling is thought to limit mantle melting and melt production 
has been inferred to be highly discontinuous. Along such spreading centres, long 
ridge sections without any igneous crust alternate with magmatic sections that
host massive volcanoes capable of strong earthquakes. Hence melt supply,
lithospheric composition and tectonic structure seem to vary considerably along
the axis of the slowest-spreading ridges. However, owing to the lack of seismic
data, the lithospheric structure of ultraslow ridges is poorly constrained. Here 
we describe the structure and accretion modes of two end-member types of oceanic 
lithosphere using a detailed seismicity survey along 390 kilometres of
ultraslow-spreading ridge axis. We observe that amagmatic sections lack shallow
seismicity in the upper 15 kilometres of the lithosphere, but unusually contain
earthquakes down to depths of 35 kilometres. This observation implies a cold,
thick lithosphere, with an upper aseismic zone that probably reflects substantial
serpentinization. We find that regions of magmatic lithosphere thin dramatically 
under volcanic centres, and infer that the resulting topography of the
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary could allow along-axis melt flow, explaining
the uneven crustal production at ultraslow-spreading ridges. The seismicity data 
indicate that alteration in ocean lithosphere may reach far deeper than
previously thought, with important implications towards seafloor deformation and 
fluid circulation.

Eukaryotic genomes are partitioned into chromosomes that form compact and
spatially well-separated mechanical bodies during mitosis. This enables
chromosomes to move independently of each other for segregation of precisely one 
copy of the genome to each of the nascent daughter cells. Despite insights into
the spatial organization of mitotic chromosomes and the discovery of proteins at 
the chromosome surface, the molecular and biophysical bases of mitotic chromosome
structural individuality have remained unclear. Here we report that the
proliferation marker protein Ki-67 (encoded by the MKI67 gene), a component of
the mitotic chromosome periphery, prevents chromosomes from collapsing into a
single chromatin mass after nuclear envelope disassembly, thus enabling
independent chromosome motility and efficient interactions with the mitotic
spindle. The chromosome separation function of human Ki-67 is not confined within
a specific protein domain, but correlates with size and net charge of truncation 
mutants that apparently lack secondary structure. This suggests that Ki-67 forms 
a steric and electrostatic charge barrier, similar to surface-active agents
(surfactants) that disperse particles or phase-separated liquid droplets in
solvents. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy showed a high surface density of 
Ki-67 and dual-colour labelling of both protein termini revealed an extended
molecular conformation, indicating brush-like arrangements that are
characteristic of polymeric surfactants. Our study thus elucidates a
biomechanical role of the mitotic chromosome periphery in mammalian cells and
suggests that natural proteins can function as surfactants in intracellular
compartmentalization.

Differences in phenological responses to climate change among species can
desynchronise ecological interactions and thereby threaten ecosystem function. To
assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on
species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile
approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially
matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate
sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied
markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this
variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of
phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower
climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change
projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more 
for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus
2.5-2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1-14.8 
days earlier on average).

Immunomodulatory drugs bind to cereblon (CRBN) to confer differentiated substrate
specificity on the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here we report the
identification of a new cereblon modulator, CC-885, with potent anti-tumour
activity. The anti-tumour activity of CC-885 is mediated through the
cereblon-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the translation termination 
factor GSPT1. Patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia tumour cells exhibit high
sensitivity to CC-885, indicating the clinical potential of this mechanism.
Crystallographic studies of the CRBN-DDB1-CC-885-GSPT1 complex reveal that GSPT1 
binds to cereblon through a surface turn containing a glycine residue at a key
position, interacting with both CC-885 and a 'hotspot' on the cereblon surface.
Although GSPT1 possesses no obvious structural, sequence or functional homology
to previously known cereblon substrates, mutational analysis and modelling
indicate that the cereblon substrate Ikaros uses a similar structural feature to 
bind cereblon, suggesting a common motif for substrate recruitment. These
findings define a structural degron underlying cereblon 'neosubstrate'
selectivity, and identify an anti-tumour target rendered druggable by cereblon
modulation.

A CRISPR screen defines a signal peptide processing pathway required by
flaviviruses.

Fernandez E, Zhang Q, Dowd KA, Pierson TC, Cherry S, Diamond MS.

Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people annually, and no antiviral
therapy is available. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to
identify host genes that, when edited, resulted in reduced flavivirus infection. 
Here, we validated nine human genes required for flavivirus infectivity, and
these were associated with endoplasmic reticulum functions including
translocation, protein degradation, and N-linked glycosylation. In particular, a 
subset of endoplasmic reticulum-associated signal peptidase complex (SPCS)
proteins was necessary for proper cleavage of the flavivirus structural proteins 
(prM and E) and secretion of viral particles. Loss of SPCS1 expression resulted
in markedly reduced yield of all Flaviviridae family members tested (West Nile,
Dengue, Zika, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and hepatitis C viruses), but 
had little impact on alphavirus, bunyavirus, or rhabdovirus infection or the
surface expression or secretion of diverse host proteins. We found that SPCS1
dependence could be bypassed by replacing the native prM protein leader sequences
with a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen leader sequence.
Thus, SPCS1, either directly or indirectly via its interactions with unknown host
proteins, preferentially promotes the processing of specific protein cargo, and
Flaviviridae have a unique dependence on this signal peptide processing pathway. 
SPCS1 and other signal processing pathway members could represent pharmacological
targets for inhibiting infection by the expanding number of flaviviruses of
medical concern.

Genetic dissection of Flaviviridae host factors through genome-scale CRISPR
screens.

Mata MA, Elias JE, Sarnow P, Carette JE.

The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that cause severe human diseases. For
example, dengue virus (DENV) is a rapidly emerging pathogen causing an estimated 
100 million symptomatic infections annually worldwide. No approved antivirals are
available to date and clinical trials with a tetravalent dengue vaccine showed
disappointingly low protection rates. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) also remains a
major medical problem, with 160 million chronically infected patients worldwide
and only expensive treatments available. Despite distinct differences in their
pathogenesis and modes of transmission, the two viruses share common replication 
strategies. A detailed understanding of the host functions that determine viral
infection is lacking. Here we use a pooled CRISPR genetic screening strategy to
comprehensively dissect host factors required for these two highly important
Flaviviridae members. For DENV, we identified endoplasmic-reticulum
(ER)-associated multi-protein complexes involved in signal sequence recognition, 
N-linked glycosylation and ER-associated degradation. DENV replication was nearly
completely abrogated in cells deficient in the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST)
complex. Mechanistic studies pinpointed viral RNA replication and not entry or
translation as the crucial step requiring the OST complex. Moreover, we show that
viral non-structural proteins bind to the OST complex. The identified
ER-associated protein complexes were also important for infection by other
mosquito-borne flaviviruses including Zika virus, an emerging pathogen causing
severe birth defects. By contrast, the most significant genes identified in the
HCV screen were distinct and included viral receptors, RNA-binding proteins and
enzymes involved in metabolism. We found an unexpected link between intracellular
flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) levels and HCV replication. This study shows
notable divergence in host-depenency factors between DENV and HCV, and
illuminates new host targets for antiviral therapy.

Inflammatory caspases (caspases 1, 4, 5 and 11) are activated in response to
microbial infection and danger signals. When activated, they cleave mouse and
human gasdermin D (GSDMD) after Asp276 and Asp275, respectively, to generate an
N-terminal cleavage product (GSDMD-NT) that triggers inflammatory death
(pyroptosis) and release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β.
Cleavage removes the C-terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT), which is thought to fold
back on GSDMD-NT to inhibit its activation. However, how GSDMD-NT causes cell
death is unknown. Here we show that GSDMD-NT oligomerizes in membranes to form
pores that are visible by electron microscopy. GSDMD-NT binds to
phosphatidylinositol phosphates and phosphatidylserine (restricted to the cell
membrane inner leaflet) and cardiolipin (present in the inner and outer leaflets 
of bacterial membranes). Mutation of four evolutionarily conserved basic residues
blocks GSDMD-NT oligomerization, membrane binding, pore formation and pyroptosis.
Because of its lipid-binding preferences, GSDMD-NT kills from within the cell,
but does not harm neighbouring mammalian cells when it is released during
pyroptosis. GSDMD-NT also kills cell-free bacteria in vitro and may have a direct
bactericidal effect within the cytosol of host cells, but the importance of
direct bacterial killing in controlling in vivo infection remains to be
determined.

Clusters of galaxies are the most massive gravitationally bound objects in the
Universe and are still forming. They are thus important probes of cosmological
parameters and many astrophysical processes. However, knowledge of the dynamics
of the pervasive hot gas, the mass of which is much larger than the combined mass
of all the stars in the cluster, is lacking. Such knowledge would enable insights
into the injection of mechanical energy by the central supermassive black hole
and the use of hydrostatic equilibrium for determining cluster masses. X-rays
from the core of the Perseus cluster are emitted by the 50-million-kelvin diffuse
hot plasma filling its gravitational potential well. The active galactic nucleus 
of the central galaxy NGC 1275 is pumping jetted energy into the surrounding
intracluster medium, creating buoyant bubbles filled with relativistic plasma.
These bubbles probably induce motions in the intracluster medium and heat the
inner gas, preventing runaway radiative cooling--a process known as active
galactic nucleus feedback. Here we report X-ray observations of the core of the
Perseus cluster, which reveal a remarkably quiescent atmosphere in which the gas 
has a line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 164 ± 10 kilometres per second in the 
region 30-60 kiloparsecs from the central nucleus. A gradient in the
line-of-sight velocity of 150 ± 70 kilometres per second is found across the
60-kiloparsec image of the cluster core. Turbulent pressure support in the gas is
four per cent of the thermodynamic pressure, with large-scale shear at most
doubling this estimate. We infer that a total cluster mass determined from
hydrostatic equilibrium in a central region would require little correction for
turbulent pressure.

Rapid advances in DNA sequencing, metabolomics, proteomics and computational
tools are dramatically increasing access to the microbiome and identification of 
its links with disease. In particular, time-series studies and multiple molecular
perspectives are facilitating microbiome-wide association studies, which are
analogous to genome-wide association studies. Early findings point to actionable 
outcomes of microbiome-wide association studies, although their clinical
application has yet to be approved. An appreciation of the complexity of
interactions among the microbiome and the host's diet, chemistry and health, as
well as determining the frequency of observations that are needed to capture and 
integrate this dynamic interface, is paramount for developing precision
diagnostics and therapies that are based on the microbiome.

The microbiome has an important role in human health. Changes in the microbiota
can confer resistance to or promote infection by pathogenic bacteria. Antibiotics
have a profound impact on the microbiota that alters the nutritional landscape of
the gut and can lead to the expansion of pathogenic populations. Pathogenic
bacteria exploit microbiota-derived sources of carbon and nitrogen as nutrients
and regulatory signals to promote their own growth and virulence. By eliciting
inflammation, these bacteria alter the intestinal environment and use unique
systems for respiration and metal acquisition to drive their expansion.
Unravelling the interactions between the microbiota, the host and pathogenic
bacteria will produce strategies for manipulating the microbiota against
infectious diseases.

In the mucosa, the immune system's T cells and B cells have position-specific
phenotypes and functions that are influenced by the microbiota. These cells play 
pivotal parts in the maintenance of immune homeostasis by suppressing responses
to harmless antigens and by enforcing the integrity of the barrier functions of
the gut mucosa. Imbalances in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, can trigger
several immune disorders through the activity of T cells that are both near to
and distant from the site of their induction. Elucidation of the mechanisms that 
distinguish between homeostatic and pathogenic microbiota-host interactions could
identify therapeutic targets for preventing or modulating inflammatory diseases
and for boosting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

The intestinal microbiome is a signalling hub that integrates environmental
inputs, such as diet, with genetic and immune signals to affect the host's
metabolism, immunity and response to infection. The haematopoietic and
non-haematopoietic cells of the innate immune system are located strategically at
the host-microbiome interface. These cells have the ability to sense
microorganisms or their metabolic products and to translate the signals into host
physiological responses and the regulation of microbial ecology. Aberrations in
the communication between the innate immune system and the gut microbiota might
contribute to complex diseases.

It is widely accepted that obesity and associated metabolic diseases, including
type 2 diabetes, are intimately linked to diet. However, the gut microbiota has
also become a focus for research at the intersection of diet and metabolic
health. Mechanisms that link the gut microbiota with obesity are coming to light 
through a powerful combination of translation-focused animal models and studies
in humans. A body of knowledge is accumulating that points to the gut microbiota 
as a mediator of dietary impact on the host metabolic status. Efforts are
focusing on the establishment of causal relationships in people and the prospect 
of therapeutic interventions such as personalized nutrition.

When most people think of human development, they tend to consider only human
cells and organs. Yet there is another facet that involves human-associated
microbial communities. A microbial perspective of human development provides
opportunities to refine our definitions of healthy prenatal and postnatal growth 
and to develop innovative strategies for disease prevention and treatment. Given 
the dramatic changes in lifestyles and disease patterns that are occurring with
globalization, we issue a call for the establishment of 'human microbial
observatories' designed to examine microbial community development in birth
cohorts representing populations with diverse anthropological characteristics,
including those undergoing rapid change.

Chemical reactions at ultracold temperatures are expected to be dominated by
quantum mechanical effects. Although progress towards ultracold chemistry has
been made through atomic photoassociation, Feshbach resonances and bimolecular
collisions, these approaches have been limited by imperfect quantum state
selectivity. In particular, attaining complete control of the ground or excited
continuum quantum states has remained a challenge. Here we achieve this control
using photodissociation, an approach that encodes a wealth of information in the 
angular distribution of outgoing fragments. By photodissociating ultracold
(88)Sr2 molecules with full control of the low-energy continuum, we access the
quantum regime of ultracold chemistry, observing resonant and nonresonant barrier
tunnelling, matter-wave interference of reaction products and forbidden reaction 
pathways. Our results illustrate the failure of the traditional quasiclassical
model of photodissociation and instead are accurately described by a quantum
mechanical model. The experimental ability to produce well-defined quantum
continuum states at low energies will enable high-precision studies of long-range
molecular potentials for which accurate quantum chemistry models are unavailable,
and may serve as a source of entangled states and coherent matter waves for a
wide range of experiments in quantum optics.

Viral proteins mimic host protein structure and function to redirect cellular
processes and subvert innate defenses. Small basic proteins compact and regulate 
both viral and cellular DNA genomes. Nucleosomes are the repeating units of
cellular chromatin and play an important part in innate immune responses.
Viral-encoded core basic proteins compact viral genomes, but their impact on host
chromatin structure and function remains unexplored. Adenoviruses encode a highly
basic protein called protein VII that resembles cellular histones. Although
protein VII binds viral DNA and is incorporated with viral genomes into virus
particles, it is unknown whether protein VII affects cellular chromatin. Here we 
show that protein VII alters cellular chromatin, leading us to hypothesize that
this has an impact on antiviral responses during adenovirus infection in human
cells. We find that protein VII forms complexes with nucleosomes and limits DNA
accessibility. We identified post-translational modifications on protein VII that
are responsible for chromatin localization. Furthermore, proteomic analysis
demonstrated that protein VII is sufficient to alter the protein composition of
host chromatin. We found that protein VII is necessary and sufficient for
retention in the chromatin of members of the high-mobility-group protein B family
(HMGB1, HMGB2 and HMGB3). HMGB1 is actively released in response to inflammatory 
stimuli and functions as a danger signal to activate immune responses. We showed 
that protein VII can directly bind HMGB1 in vitro and further demonstrated that
protein VII expression in mouse lungs is sufficient to decrease
inflammation-induced HMGB1 content and neutrophil recruitment in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Together, our in vitro and in vivo results show
that protein VII sequesters HMGB1 and can prevent its release. This study
uncovers a viral strategy in which nucleosome binding is exploited to control
extracellular immune signaling.

Concerted political attention has focused on reducing deforestation, and this
remains the cornerstone of most biodiversity conservation strategies. However,
maintaining forest cover may not reduce anthropogenic forest disturbances, which 
are rarely considered in conservation programmes. These disturbances occur both
within forests, including selective logging and wildfires, and at the landscape
level, through edge, area and isolation effects. Until now, the combined effect
of anthropogenic disturbance on the conservation value of remnant primary forests
has remained unknown, making it impossible to assess the relative importance of
forest disturbance and forest loss. Here we address these knowledge gaps using a 
large data set of plants, birds and dung beetles (1,538, 460 and 156 species,
respectively) sampled in 36 catchments in the Brazilian state of Pará. Catchments
retaining more than 69–80% forest cover lost more conservation value from
disturbance than from forest loss. For example, a 20% loss of primary forest, the
maximum level of deforestation allowed on Amazonian properties under Brazil’s
Forest Code, resulted in a 39–54% loss of conservation value: 96–171% more than
expected without considering disturbance effects. We extrapolated the
disturbance-mediated loss of conservation value throughout Pará, which covers 25%
of the Brazilian Amazon. Although disturbed forests retained considerable
conservation value compared with deforested areas, the toll of disturbance
outside Pará’s strictly protected areas is equivalent to the loss of
92,000–139,000 km2 of primary forest. Even this lowest estimate is greater than
the area deforested across the entire Brazilian Amazon between 2006 and 2015
(ref. 10). Species distribution models showed that both landscape and
within-forest disturbances contributed to biodiversity loss, with the greatest
negative effects on species of high conservation and functional value. These
results demonstrate an urgent need for policy interventions that go beyond the
maintenance of forest cover to safeguard the hyper-diversity of tropical forest
ecosystems.

Allosteric coupling from G protein to the agonist-binding pocket in GPCRs.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain the primary conduit by which cells
detect environmental stimuli and communicate with each other. Upon activation by 
extracellular agonists, these seven-transmembrane-domain-containing receptors
interact with heterotrimeric G proteins to regulate downstream second messenger
and/or protein kinase cascades. Crystallographic evidence from a prototypic GPCR,
the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), in complex with its cognate G protein, Gs, has
provided a model for how agonist binding promotes conformational changes that
propagate through the GPCR and into the nucleotide-binding pocket of the G
protein α-subunit to catalyse GDP release, the key step required for GTP binding 
and activation of G proteins. The structure also offers hints about how G-protein
binding may, in turn, allosterically influence ligand binding. Here we provide
functional evidence that G-protein coupling to the β2AR stabilizes a ‘closed’
receptor conformation characterized by restricted access to and egress from the
hormone-binding site. Surprisingly, the effects of G protein on the
hormone-binding site can be observed in the absence of a bound agonist, where
G-protein coupling driven by basal receptor activity impedes the association of
agonists, partial agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists. The ability of
bound ligands to dissociate from the receptor is also hindered, providing a
structural explanation for the G-protein-mediated enhancement of agonist
affinity, which has been observed for many GPCR–G-protein pairs. Our data also
indicate that, in contrast to agonist binding alone, coupling of a G protein in
the absence of an agonist stabilizes large structural changes in a GPCR. The
effects of nucleotide-free G protein on ligand-binding kinetics are shared by
other members of the superfamily of GPCRs, suggesting that a common mechanism may
underlie G-protein-mediated enhancement of agonist affinity.

Ebola viruses (EBOVs) are responsible for repeated outbreaks of fatal infections,
including the recent deadly epidemic in West Africa. There are currently no
approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines for the disease. EBOV has a membrane
envelope decorated by trimers of a glycoprotein (GP, cleaved by furin to form GP1
and GP2 subunits), which is solely responsible for host cell attachment,
endosomal entry and membrane fusion. GP is thus a primary target for the
development of antiviral drugs. Here we report the first, to our knowledge,
unliganded structure of EBOV GP, and high-resolution complexes of GP with the
anticancer drug toremifene and the painkiller ibuprofen. The high-resolution apo 
structure gives a more complete and accurate picture of the molecule, and allows 
conformational changes introduced by antibody and receptor binding to be
deciphered. Unexpectedly, both toremifene and ibuprofen bind in a cavity between 
the attachment (GP1) and fusion (GP2) subunits at the entrance to a large tunnel 
that links with equivalent tunnels from the other monomers of the trimer at the
three-fold axis. Protein–drug interactions with both GP1 and GP2 are
predominately hydrophobic. Residues lining the binding site are highly conserved 
among filoviruses except Marburg virus (MARV), suggesting that MARV may not bind 
these drugs. Thermal shift assays show up to a 14 °C decrease in the protein
melting temperature after toremifene binding, while ibuprofen has only a marginal
effect and is a less potent inhibitor. These results suggest that inhibitor
binding destabilizes GP and triggers premature release of GP2, thereby preventing
fusion between the viral and endosome membranes. Thus, these complex structures
reveal the mechanism of inhibition and may guide the development of more powerful
anti-EBOV drugs.

The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, has an
important role in signal transduction downstream of growth factor receptor
signalling and was the first reported oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase. Activating 
mutations of SHP2 have been associated with developmental pathologies such as
Noonan syndrome and are found in multiple cancer types, including leukaemia, lung
and breast cancer and neuroblastoma. SHP2 is ubiquitously expressed and regulates
cell survival and proliferation primarily through activation of the RAS–ERK
signalling pathway. It is also a key mediator of the programmed cell death 1
(PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) immune checkpoint pathways.
Reduction of SHP2 activity suppresses tumour cell growth and is a potential
target of cancer therapy. Here we report the discovery of a highly potent
(IC50 = 0.071 μM), selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule SHP2
inhibitor, SHP099, that stabilizes SHP2 in an auto-inhibited conformation. SHP099
concurrently binds to the interface of the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, and
protein tyrosine phosphatase domains, thus inhibiting SHP2 activity through an
allosteric mechanism. SHP099 suppresses RAS–ERK signalling to inhibit the
proliferation of receptor-tyrosine-kinase-driven human cancer cells in vitro and 
is efficacious in mouse tumour xenograft models. Together, these data demonstrate
that pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 is a valid therapeutic approach for the
treatment of cancers.

Lanthanum-catalysed synthesis of microporous 3D graphene-like carbons in a
zeolite template.

Kim K, Lee T, Kwon Y, Seo Y, Song J, Park JK, Lee H, Park JY, Ihee H, Cho SJ,
Ryoo R.

Three-dimensional graphene architectures with periodic nanopores—reminiscent of
zeolite frameworks—are of topical interest because of the possibility of
combining the characteristics of graphene with a three-dimensional porous
structure. Lately, the synthesis of such carbons has been approached by using
zeolites as templates and small hydrocarbon molecules that can enter the narrow
pore apertures. However, pyrolytic carbonization of the hydrocarbons (a necessary
step in generating pure carbon) requires high temperatures and results in
non-selective carbon deposition outside the pores. Here, we demonstrate that
lanthanum ions embedded in zeolite pores can lower the temperature required for
the carbonization of ethylene or acetylene. In this way, a graphene-like carbon
structure can be selectively formed inside the zeolite template, without carbon
being deposited at the external surfaces. X-ray diffraction data from zeolite
single crystals after carbonization indicate that electron densities
corresponding to carbon atoms are generated along the walls of the zeolite pores.
After the zeolite template is removed, the carbon framework exhibits an
electrical conductivity that is two orders of magnitude higher than that of
amorphous mesoporous carbon. Lanthanum catalysis allows a carbon framework to
form in zeolite pores with diameters of less than 1 nanometre; as such,
microporous carbon nanostructures can be reproduced with various topologies
corresponding to different zeolite pore sizes and shapes. We demonstrate carbon
synthesis for large-pore zeolites (FAU, EMT and beta), a one-dimensional
medium-pore zeolite (LTL), and even small-pore zeolites (MFI and LTA). The
catalytic effect is a common feature of lanthanum, yttrium and calcium, which are
all carbide-forming metal elements. We also show that the synthesis can be
readily scaled up, which will be important for practical applications such as the
production of lithium-ion batteries and zeolite-like catalyst supports.

The nature of mutations induced by replication–transcription collisions.

Sankar TS, Wastuwidyaningtyas BD, Dong Y, Lewis SA, Wang JD.

The DNA replication and transcription machineries share a common DNA template and
thus can collide with each other co-directionally or head-on.
Replication–transcription collisions can cause replication fork arrest, premature
transcription termination, DNA breaks, and recombination intermediates
threatening genome integrity. Collisions may also trigger mutations, which are
major contributors to genetic disease and evolution. However, the nature and
mechanisms of collision-induced mutagenesis remain poorly understood. Here we
reveal the genetic consequences of replication–transcription collisions in
actively dividing bacteria to be two classes of mutations: duplications/deletions
and base substitutions in promoters. Both signatures are highly deleterious but
are distinct from the previously well-characterized base substitutions in the
coding sequence. Duplications/deletions are probably caused by replication
stalling events that are triggered by collisions; their distribution patterns are
consistent with where the fork first encounters a transcription complex upon
entering a transcription unit. Promoter substitutions result mostly from head-on 
collisions and frequently occur at a nucleotide that is conserved in promoters
recognized by the major σ factor in bacteria. This substitution is generated via 
adenine deamination on the template strand in the promoter open complex, as a
consequence of head-on replication perturbing transcription initiation. We
conclude that replication–transcription collisions induce distinct mutation
signatures by antagonizing replication and transcription, not only in coding
sequences but also in gene regulatory elements.

Species-specific wiring for direction selectivity in the mammalian retina.

Comment in
    Nature. 2016 Jul 7;535(7610):45-6.

Directionally tuned signalling in starburst amacrine cell (SAC) dendrites lies at
the heart of the circuit that detects the direction of moving stimuli in the
mammalian retina. The relative contributions of intrinsic cellular properties and
network connectivity to SAC direction selectivity remain unclear. Here we present
a detailed connectomic reconstruction of SAC circuitry in mouse retina and
describe two previously unknown features of synapse distributions along SAC
dendrites: input and output synapses are segregated, with inputs restricted to
proximal dendrites; and the distribution of inhibitory inputs is fundamentally
different from that observed in rabbit retina. An anatomically constrained SAC
network model suggests that SAC–SAC wiring differences between mouse and rabbit
retina underlie distinct contributions of synaptic inhibition to velocity and
contrast tuning and receptive field structure. In particular, the model indicates
that mouse connectivity enables SACs to encode lower linear velocities that
account for smaller eye diameter, thereby conserving angular velocity tuning.
These predictions are confirmed with calcium imaging of mouse SAC dendrites
responding to directional stimuli.

The dodecahedron [corrected] is the largest of the Platonic solids, and
icosahedral protein structures are widely used in biological systems for
packaging and transport. There has been considerable interest in repurposing such
structures for applications ranging from targeted delivery to multivalent
immunogen presentation. The ability to design proteins that self-assemble into
precisely specified, highly ordered icosahedral structures would open the door to
a new generation of protein containers with properties custom-tailored to
specific applications. Here we describe the computational design of a
25-nanometre icosahedral nanocage that self-assembles from trimeric protein
building blocks. The designed protein was produced in Escherichia coli, and found
by electron microscopy to assemble into a homogenous population of icosahedral
particles nearly identical to the design model. The particles are stable in 6.7
molar guanidine hydrochloride at up to 80 degrees Celsius, and undergo extremely 
abrupt, but reversible, disassembly between 2 molar and 2.25 molar guanidinium
thiocyanate. The dodecahedron [corrected] is robust to genetic fusions: one or
two copies of green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be fused to each of the 60
subunits to create highly fluorescent ‘standard candles’ for use in light
microscopy, and a designed protein pentamer can be placed in the centre of each
of the 20 pentameric faces to modulate the size of the entrance/exit channels of 
the cage. Such robust and customizable nanocages should have considerable utility
in targeted drug delivery, vaccine design and synthetic biology.

Subduction controls the distribution and fragmentation of Earth’s tectonic
plates.

Mallard C, Coltice N, Seton M, Müller RD, Tackley PJ.

The theory of plate tectonics describes how the surface of Earth is split into an
organized jigsaw of seven large plates of similar sizes and a population of
smaller plates whose areas follow a fractal distribution. The reconstruction of
global tectonics during the past 200 million years suggests that this layout is
probably a long-term feature of Earth, but the forces governing it are unknown.
Previous studies, primarily based on the statistical properties of plate
distributions, were unable to resolve how the size of the plates is determined by
the properties of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle convection. Here we
demonstrate that the plate layout of Earth is produced by a dynamic feedback
between mantle convection and the strength of the lithosphere. Using
three-dimensional spherical models of mantle convection that self-consistently
produce the plate size–frequency distribution observed for Earth, we show that
subduction geometry drives the tectonic fragmentation that generates plates. The 
spacing between the slabs controls the layout of large plates, and the stresses
caused by the bending of trenches break plates into smaller fragments. Our
results explain why the fast evolution in small back-arc plates reflects the

opens the way to using convection simulations with plate-like behaviour to

Single-molecule strong coupling at room temperature in plasmonic nanocavities.

Chikkaraddy R, de Nijs B, Benz F, Barrow SJ, Scherman OA, Rosta E, Demetriadou A,
Fox P, Hess O, Baumberg JJ.

Photon emitters placed in an optical cavity experience an environment that
changes how they are coupled to the surrounding light field. In the weak-coupling
regime, the extraction of light from the emitter is enhanced. But more profound
effects emerge when single-emitter strong coupling occurs: mixed states are
produced that are part light, part matter1, 2, forming building blocks for
quantum information systems and for ultralow-power switches and lasers. Such
cavity quantum electrodynamics has until now been the preserve of low
temperatures and complicated fabrication methods, compromising its use. Here, by 
scaling the cavity volume to less than 40 cubic nanometres and using host–guest
chemistry to align one to ten protectively isolated methylene-blue molecules, we 
reach the strong-coupling regime at room temperature and in ambient conditions.
Dispersion curves from more than 50 such plasmonic nanocavities display
characteristic light–matter mixing, with Rabi frequencies of 300
millielectronvolts for ten methylene-blue molecules, decreasing to 90
millielectronvolts for single molecules—matching quantitative models. Statistical
analysis of vibrational spectroscopy time series and dark-field scattering
spectra provides evidence of single-molecule strong coupling. This dressing of
molecules with light can modify photochemistry, opening up the exploration of
complex natural processes such as photosynthesis and the possibility of
manipulating chemical bonds.

Inflammatory caspases cleave the gasdermin D (GSDMD) protein to trigger
pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death that is crucial for immune defences and
diseases. GSDMD contains a functionally important gasdermin-N domain that is
shared in the gasdermin family. The functional mechanism of action of gasdermin
proteins is unknown. Here we show that the gasdermin-N domains of the gasdermin
proteins GSDMD, GSDMA3 and GSDMA can bind membrane lipids, phosphoinositides and 
cardiolipin, and exhibit membrane-disrupting cytotoxicity in mammalian cells and 
artificially transformed bacteria. Gasdermin-N moved to the plasma membrane
during pyroptosis. Purified gasdermin-N efficiently lysed
phosphoinositide/cardiolipin-containing liposomes and formed pores on membranes
made of artificial or natural phospholipid mixtures. Most gasdermin pores had an 
inner diameter of 10–14 nm and contained 16 symmetric protomers. The crystal
structure of GSDMA3 showed an autoinhibited two-domain architecture that is
conserved in the gasdermin family. Structure-guided mutagenesis demonstrated that
the liposome-leakage and pore-forming activities of the gasdermin-N domain are
required for pyroptosis. These findings reveal the mechanism for pyroptosis and
provide insights into the roles of the gasdermin family in necrosis, immunity and
diseases.

Many organs are composed of complex tissue walls that are structurally organized 
to optimize organ function. In particular, the ventricular myocardial wall of the
heart comprises an outer compact layer that concentrically encircles the
ridge-like inner trabecular layer. Although disruption in the morphogenesis of
this myocardial wall can lead to various forms of congenital heart disease and
non-compaction cardiomyopathies, it remains unclear how embryonic cardiomyocytes 
assemble to form ventricular wall layers of appropriate spatial dimensions and
myocardial mass. Here we use advanced genetic and imaging tools in zebrafish to
reveal an interplay between myocardial Notch and Erbb2 signalling that directs
the spatial allocation of myocardial cells to their proper morphological
positions in the ventricular wall. Although previous studies have shown that
endocardial Notch signalling non-cell-autonomously promotes myocardial
trabeculation through Erbb2 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, we
discover that distinct ventricular cardiomyocyte clusters exhibit myocardial
Notch activity that cell-autonomously inhibits Erbb2 signalling and prevents
cardiomyocyte sprouting and trabeculation. Myocardial-specific Notch inactivation
leads to ventricles of reduced size and increased wall thickness because of
excessive trabeculae, whereas widespread myocardial Notch activity results in
ventricles of increased size with a single-cell-thick wall but no trabeculae.
Notably, this myocardial Notch signalling is activated non-cell-autonomously by
neighbouring Erbb2-activated cardiomyocytes that sprout and form nascent
trabeculae. Thus, these findings support an interactive cellular feedback process
that guides the assembly of cardiomyocytes to morphologically create the
ventricular myocardial wall and more broadly provide insight into the cellular
dynamics of how diverse cell lineages organize to create form.

Maladaptive aggressive behaviour is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric 
disorders and is thought to result partly from the inappropriate activation of
brain reward systems in response to aggressive or violent social stimuli. Nuclei 
within the ventromedial hypothalamus, extended amygdala and limbic circuits are
known to encode initiation of aggression; however, little is known about the
neural mechanisms that directly modulate the motivational component of aggressive
behaviour. Here we established a mouse model to measure the valence of aggressive
inter-male social interaction with a smaller subordinate intruder as
reinforcement for the development of conditioned place preference (CPP).
Aggressors develop a CPP, whereas non-aggressors develop a conditioned place
aversion to the intruder-paired context. Furthermore, we identify a functional
GABAergic projection from the basal forebrain (BF) to the lateral habenula (lHb) 
that bi-directionally controls the valence of aggressive interactions.
Circuit-specific silencing of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of aggressors with
halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0) increases lHb neuronal firing and abolishes CPP to the
intruder-paired context. Activation of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of
non-aggressors with channelrhodopsin (ChR2) decreases lHb neuronal firing and
promotes CPP to the intruder-paired context. Finally, we show that altering
inhibitory transmission at BF-lHb terminals does not control the initiation of
aggressive behaviour. These results demonstrate that the BF-lHb circuit has a
critical role in regulating the valence of inter-male aggressive behaviour and
provide novel mechanistic insight into the neural circuits modulating aggression 
reward processing.

Interdisciplinary research is widely considered a hothouse for innovation, and
the only plausible approach to complex problems such as climate change. One
barrier to interdisciplinary research is the widespread perception that
interdisciplinary projects are less likely to be funded than those with a
narrower focus. However, this commonly held belief has been difficult to evaluate
objectively, partly because of lack of a comparable, quantitative measure of
degree of interdisciplinarity that can be applied to funding application data.
Here we compare the degree to which research proposals span disparate fields by
using a biodiversity metric that captures the relative representation of
different fields (balance) and their degree of difference (disparity). The
Australian Research Council's Discovery Programme provides an ideal test case,
because a single annual nationwide competitive grants scheme covers fundamental
research in all disciplines, including arts, humanities and sciences. Using data 
on all 18,476 proposals submitted to the scheme over 5 consecutive years,
including successful and unsuccessful applications, we show that the greater the 
degree of interdisciplinarity, the lower the probability of being funded. The
negative impact of interdisciplinarity is significant even when number of
collaborators, primary research field and type of institution are taken into
account. This is the first broad-scale quantitative assessment of success rates
of interdisciplinary research proposals. The interdisciplinary distance metric
allows efficient evaluation of trends in research funding, and could be used to
identify proposals that require assessment strategies appropriate to
interdisciplinary research.

Terrestrial ecosystems currently offset one-quarter of anthropogenic carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions because of a slight imbalance between global terrestrial 
photosynthesis and respiration. Understanding what controls these two biological 
fluxes is therefore crucial to predicting climate change. Yet there is no way of 
directly measuring the photosynthesis or daytime respiration of a whole ecosystem
of interacting organisms; instead, these fluxes are generally inferred from
measurements of net ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange (NEE), in a way that is
based on assumed ecosystem-scale responses to the environment. The consequent
view of temperate deciduous forests (an important CO2 sink) is that, first,
ecosystem respiration is greater during the day than at night; and second,
ecosystem photosynthetic light-use efficiency peaks after leaf expansion in
spring and then declines, presumably because of leaf ageing or water stress. This
view has underlain the development of terrestrial biosphere models used in
climate prediction and of remote sensing indices of global biosphere
productivity. Here, we use new isotopic instrumentation to determine ecosystem
photosynthesis and daytime respiration in a temperate deciduous forest over a
three-year period. We find that ecosystem respiration is lower during the day
than at night-the first robust evidence of the inhibition of leaf respiration by 
light at the ecosystem scale. Because they do not capture this effect, standard
approaches overestimate ecosystem photosynthesis and daytime respiration in the
first half of the growing season at our site, and inaccurately portray ecosystem 
photosynthetic light-use efficiency. These findings revise our understanding of
forest-atmosphere carbon exchange, and provide a basis for investigating how
leaf-level physiological dynamics manifest at the canopy scale in other
ecosystems.

Oxygen isotope records from Chinese caves characterize changes in both the Asian 
monsoon and global climate. Here, using our new speleothem data, we extend the
Chinese record to cover the full uranium/thorium dating range, that is, the past 
640,000 years. The record's length and temporal precision allow us to test the
idea that insolation changes caused by the Earth's precession drove the
terminations of each of the last seven ice ages as well as the millennia-long
intervals of reduced monsoon rainfall associated with each of the terminations.
On the basis of our record's timing, the terminations are separated by four or
five precession cycles, supporting the idea that the '100,000-year' ice age cycle
is an average of discrete numbers of precession cycles. Furthermore, the
suborbital component of monsoon rainfall variability exhibits power in both the
precession and obliquity bands, and is nearly in anti-phase with summer boreal
insolation. These observations indicate that insolation, in part, sets the pace
of the occurrence of millennial-scale events, including those associated with
terminations and 'unfinished terminations'.

The Paris climate agreement aims at holding global warming to well below 2
degrees Celsius and to "pursue efforts" to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To
accomplish this, countries have submitted Intended Nationally Determined
Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate action. Here we assess
the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its
implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate
agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively
lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but
still imply a median warming of 2.6-3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be
achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope. Substantial
enhancement or over-delivery on current INDCs by additional national,
sub-national and non-state actions is required to maintain a reasonable chance of
meeting the target of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius.

When a gecko moves on a ceiling it makes use of adhesion and stiction.
Stiction--static friction--is experienced on microscopic and macroscopic scales
and is related to adhesion and sliding friction. Although important for most
locomotive processes, the concepts of adhesion, stiction and sliding friction are
often only empirically correlated. A more detailed understanding of these
concepts will, for example, help to improve the design of increasingly smaller
devices such as micro- and nanoelectromechanical switches. Here we show how
stiction and adhesion are related for a liquid drop on a hexagonal boron nitride 
monolayer on rhodium, by measuring dynamic contact angles in two distinct states 
of the solid-liquid interface: a corrugated state in the absence of hydrogen
intercalation and an intercalation-induced flat state. Stiction and adhesion can 
be reversibly switched by applying different electrochemical potentials to the
sample, causing atomic hydrogen to be intercalated or not. We ascribe the change 
in adhesion to a change in lateral electric field of in-plane two-nanometre
dipole rings, because it cannot be explained by the change in surface roughness
known from the Wenzel model. Although the change in adhesion can be calculated
for the system we study, it is not yet possible to determine the stiction at such
a solid-liquid interface using ab initio methods. The inorganic hybrid of
hexagonal boron nitride and rhodium is very stable and represents a new class of 
switchable surfaces with the potential for application in the study of adhesion, 
friction and lubrication.

Mitochondrial unfolded protein response controls matrix pre-RNA processing and
translation.

Münch C, Harper JW.

The mitochondrial matrix is unique in that it must integrate the folding and
assembly of proteins derived from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. In
Caenorhabditis elegans, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt)
senses matrix protein misfolding and induces a program of nuclear gene
expression, including mitochondrial chaperonins, to promote mitochondrial
proteostasis. While misfolded mitochondrial-matrix-localized ornithine
transcarbamylase induces chaperonin expression, our understanding of mammalian
UPRmt is rudimentary, reflecting a lack of acute triggers for UPRmt activation.
This limitation has prevented analysis of the cellular responses to matrix
protein misfolding and the effects of UPRmt on mitochondrial translation to
control protein folding loads. Here we combine pharmacological inhibitors of
matrix-localized HSP90/TRAP1 (ref. 8) or LON protease, which promote chaperonin
expression, with global transcriptional and proteomic analysis to reveal an
extensive and acute response of human cells to UPRmt. This response encompasses
widespread induction of nuclear genes, including matrix-localized proteins
involved in folding, pre-RNA processing and translation. Functional studies
revealed rapid but reversible translation inhibition in mitochondria occurring
concurrently with defects in pre-RNA processing caused by transcriptional
repression and LON-dependent turnover of the mitochondrial pre-RNA processing
nuclease MRPP3 (ref. 10). This study reveals that acute mitochondrial protein
folding stress activates both increased chaperone availability within the matrix 
and reduced matrix-localized protein synthesis through translational inhibition, 
and provides a framework for further dissection of mammalian UPRmt.

A combinatorial strategy for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

Stanchina E, Poirier JT, Gainor JF, Corcoran RB, Engelman JA, Rudin CM, Rosen N,

Therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma represents a major goal 
of clinical oncology. KRAS itself has proved difficult to inhibit, and the
effectiveness of agents that target key KRAS effectors has been thwarted by
activation of compensatory or parallel pathways that limit their efficacy as
single agents. Here we take a systematic approach towards identifying combination
targets for trametinib, a MEK inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration, which acts downstream of KRAS to suppress signalling through the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Informed by a short-hairpin RNA 
screen, we show that trametinib provokes a compensatory response involving the
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to signalling rebound and 
adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacological inhibition
of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumour cell death in vitro and
in vivo. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities: it is dominated
by FGFR1 in KRAS-mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or
involves other mechanisms in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer
cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and patients’ tumours treated
with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation, a biomarker of FGFR
activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates with
sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations. These results
demonstrate that FGFR1 can mediate adaptive resistance to trametinib and validate
a combinatorial approach for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

After DNA replication, chromosomal processes including DNA repair and
transcription take place in the context of sister chromatids. While cell cycle
regulation can guide these processes globally, mechanisms to distinguish pre- and
post-replicative states locally remain unknown. Here we reveal that new histones 
incorporated during DNA replication provide a signature of post-replicative
chromatin, read by the human TONSL–MMS22L homologous recombination complex. We
identify the TONSL ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) as a reader of histone H4 tails
unmethylated at K20 (H4K20me0), which are specific to new histones incorporated
during DNA replication and mark post-replicative chromatin until the G2/M phase
of the cell cycle. Accordingly, TONSL–MMS22L binds new histones H3–H4 both before
and after incorporation into nucleosomes, remaining on replicated chromatin until
late G2/M. H4K20me0 recognition is required for TONSL–MMS22L binding to chromatin
and accumulation at challenged replication forks and DNA lesions. Consequently,
TONSL ARD mutants are toxic, compromising genome stability, cell viability and
resistance to replication stress. Together, these data reveal a
histone-reader-based mechanism for recognizing the post-replicative state,
offering a new angle to understand DNA repair with the potential for targeted
cancer therapy.

Rates and mechanisms of bacterial mutagenesis from maximum-depth sequencing.

Jee J, Rasouly A, Shamovsky I, Akivis Y, Steinman SR, Mishra B, Nudler E.

In 1943, Luria and Delbrück used a phage-resistance assay to establish
spontaneous mutation as a driving force of microbial diversity. Mutation rates
are still studied using such assays, but these can only be used to examine the
small minority of mutations conferring survival in a particular condition. Newer 
approaches, such as long-term evolution followed by whole-genome sequencing, may 
be skewed by mutational ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ spots. Both approaches are affected by
numerous caveats. Here we devise a method, maximum-depth sequencing (MDS), to
detect extremely rare variants in a population of cells through error-corrected, 
high-throughput sequencing. We directly measure locus-specific mutation rates in 
Escherichia coli and show that they vary across the genome by at least an order
of magnitude. Our data suggest that certain types of nucleotide misincorporation 
occur 10(4)-fold more frequently than the basal rate of mutations, but are
repaired in vivo. Our data also suggest specific mechanisms of antibiotic-induced
mutagenesis, including downregulation of mismatch repair via oxidative stress,
transcription–replication conflicts, and, in the case of fluoroquinolones, direct
damage to DNA.

Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic cells, and
while the cells may migrate by metastasis, they remain within that single
individual. Natural transmission of cancer cells from one individual to another
has been observed in two distinct cases in mammals (Tasmanian devils and dogs),
but these are generally considered to be rare exceptions in nature. The discovery
of transmissible cancer in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) suggested that this
phenomenon might be more widespread. Here we analyse disseminated neoplasia in
mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet
shell clams (Polititapes aureus) and find that neoplasias in all three species
are attributable to independent transmissible cancer lineages. In mussels and
cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from their respective host species;
however, unexpectedly, cancer cells in P. aureus are all derived from Venerupis
corrugata, a different species living in the same geographical area. No cases of 
disseminated neoplasia have thus far been found in V. corrugata from the same
region. These findings show that transmission of cancer cells in the marine
environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many times, and
that while most transmissible cancers are found spreading within the species of
origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells can occur.

A hot Jupiter orbiting a 2-million-year-old solar-mass T Tauri star.

Hot Jupiters are giant Jupiter-like exoplanets that orbit their host stars 100
times more closely than Jupiter orbits the Sun. These planets presumably form in 
the outer part of the primordial disk from which both the central star and
surrounding planets are born, then migrate inwards and yet avoid falling into
their host star. It is, however, unclear whether this occurs early in the lives
of hot Jupiters, when they are still embedded within protoplanetary disks, or
later, once multiple planets are formed and interact. Although numerous hot
Jupiters have been detected around mature Sun-like stars, their existence has not
yet been firmly demonstrated for young stars, whose magnetic activity is so
intense that it overshadows the radial velocity signal that close-in giant
planets can induce. Here we report that the radial velocities of the young star
V830 Tau exhibit a sine wave of period 4.93 days and semi-amplitude 75 metres per
second, detected with a false-alarm probability of less than 0.03 per cent, after
filtering out the magnetic activity plaguing the spectra. We find that this
signal is unrelated to the 2.741-day rotation period of V830 Tau and we attribute
it to the presence of a planet of mass 0.77 times that of Jupiter, orbiting at a 
distance of 0.057 astronomical units from the host star. Our result demonstrates 
that hot Jupiters can migrate inwards in less than two million years, probably as
a result of planet–disk interactions.

A Neptune-sized transiting planet closely orbiting a 5–10-million-year-old star.

SA.

Theories of the formation and early evolution of planetary systems postulate that
planets are born in circumstellar disks, and undergo radial migration during and 
after dissipation of the dust and gas disk from which they formed. The precise
ages of meteorites indicate that planetesimals—the building blocks of planets—are
produced within the first million years of a star’s life. Fully formed planets
are frequently detected on short orbital periods around mature stars. Some
theories suggest that the in situ formation of planets close to their host stars 
is unlikely and that the existence of such planets is therefore evidence of
large-scale migration. Other theories posit that planet assembly at small orbital
separations may be common. Here we report a newly born, transiting planet
orbiting its star with a period of 5.4 days. The planet is 50 per cent larger
than Neptune, and its mass is less than 3.6 times that of Jupiter (at 99.7 per
cent confidence), with a true mass likely to be similar to that of Neptune. The
star is 5–10 million years old and has a tenuous dust disk extending outward from
about twice the Earth–Sun separation, in addition to the fully formed planet
located at less than one-twentieth of the Earth–Sun separation.

Cryo-EM structure of a human cytoplasmic actomyosin complex at near-atomic
resolution.

von der Ecken J, Heissler SM, Pathan-Chhatbar S, Manstein DJ, Raunser S.

The interaction of myosin with actin filaments is the central feature of muscle
contraction and cargo movement along actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. The
energy for these movements is generated during a complex mechanochemical reaction
cycle. Crystal structures of myosin in different states have provided important
structural insights into the myosin motor cycle when myosin is detached from
F-actin. The difficulty of obtaining diffracting crystals, however, has prevented
structure determination by crystallography of actomyosin complexes. Thus,
although structural models exist of F-actin in complex with various myosins, a
high-resolution structure of the F-actin–myosin complex is missing. Here, using
electron cryomicroscopy, we present the structure of a human rigor actomyosin
complex at an average resolution of 3.9 Å. The structure reveals details of the
actomyosin interface, which is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The
negatively charged amino (N) terminus of actin interacts with a conserved basic
motif in loop 2 of myosin, promoting cleft closure in myosin. Surprisingly, the
overall structure of myosin is similar to rigor-like myosin structures in the
absence of F-actin, indicating that F-actin binding induces only minimal
conformational changes in myosin. A comparison with pre-powerstroke and
intermediate (Pi-release) states of myosin allows us to discuss the general
mechanism of myosin binding to F-actin. Our results serve as a strong foundation 
for the molecular understanding of cytoskeletal diseases, such as autosomal
dominant hearing loss and diseases affecting skeletal and cardiac muscles, in
particular nemaline myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Changes in the gut microbiota may underpin many human diseases, but the
mechanisms that are responsible for altering microbial communities remain poorly 
understood. Antibiotic usage elevates the risk of contracting gastroenteritis
caused by Salmonella enterica serovars, increases the duration for which patients
shed the pathogen in their faeces, and may on occasion produce a bacteriologic
and symptomatic relapse. These antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota
can be studied in mice, in which the disruption of a balanced microbial community
by treatment with the antibiotic streptomycin leads to an expansion of S.
enterica serovars in the large bowel. However, the mechanisms by which
streptomycin treatment drives an expansion of S. enterica serovars are not fully 
resolved. Here we show that host-mediated oxidation of galactose and glucose
promotes post-antibiotic expansion of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.
Typhimurium). By elevating expression of the gene encoding inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) in the caecal mucosa, streptomycin treatment increased
post-antibiotic availability of the oxidation products galactarate and glucarate 
in the murine caecum. S. Typhimurium used galactarate and glucarate within the
gut lumen of streptomycin pre-treated mice, and genetic ablation of the
respective catabolic pathways reduced S. Typhimurium competitiveness. Our results
identify host-mediated oxidation of carbohydrates in the gut as a mechanism for
post-antibiotic pathogen expansion.

The landscape of accessible chromatin in mammalian preimplantation embryos.

In mammals, extensive chromatin reorganization is essential for reprogramming
terminally committed gametes to a totipotent state during preimplantation
development. However, the global chromatin landscape and its dynamics in this
period remain unexplored. Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible
chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq)
approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. We show that
despite extensive parental asymmetry in DNA methylomes, the chromatin
accessibility between the parental genomes is globally comparable after major
zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely 
shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with putative
cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible chromatin is also found near
the transcription end sites of active genes. By integrating the maps of
cis-regulatory elements and single-cell transcriptomes, we construct the
regulatory network of early development, which helps to identify the key
modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the activities of
cis-regulatory elements and their associated open chromatin diminished before
major ZGA. Surprisingly, we observed many loci showing non-canonical, large open 
chromatin domains over the entire transcribed units in minor ZGA, supporting the 
presence of an unusually permissive chromatin state. Together, these data reveal 
a unique spatiotemporal chromatin configuration that accompanies early mammalian 
development.

Synthetic Landau levels for photons.

Schine N, Ryou A, Gromov A, Sommer A, Simon J.

Synthetic photonic materials are an emerging platform for exploring the interface
between microscopic quantum dynamics and macroscopic material properties. Photons
experiencing a Lorentz force develop handedness, providing opportunities to study
quantum Hall physics and topological quantum science. Here we present an
experimental realization of a magnetic field for continuum photons. We trap
optical photons in a multimode ring resonator to make a two-dimensional gas of
massive bosons, and then employ a non-planar geometry to induce an image rotation
on each round-trip. This results in photonic Coriolis/Lorentz and centrifugal
forces and so realizes the Fock–Darwin Hamiltonian for photons in a magnetic
field and harmonic trap. Using spatial- and energy-resolved spectroscopy, we
track the resulting photonic eigenstates as radial trapping is reduced, finally
observing a photonic Landau level at degeneracy. To circumvent the challenge of
trap instability at the centrifugal limit, we constrain the photons to move on a 
cone. Spectroscopic probes demonstrate flat space (zero curvature) away from the 
cone tip. At the cone tip, we observe that spatial curvature increases the local 
density of states, and we measure fractional state number excess consistent with 
the Wen–Zee theory, providing an experimental test of this theory of electrons in
both a magnetic field and curved space. This work opens the door to exploration
of the interplay of geometry and topology, and in conjunction with Rydberg
electromagnetically induced transparency, enables studies of photonic fractional 
quantum Hall fluids and direct detection of anyons.

Tunable two-dimensional arrays of single Rydberg atoms for realizing quantum
Ising models.

Labuhn H, Barredo D, Ravets S, de Léséleuc S, Macrì T, Lahaye T, Browaeys A.

Spin models are the prime example of simplified many-body Hamiltonians used to
model complex, strongly correlated real-world materials. However, despite the
simplified character of such models, their dynamics often cannot be simulated
exactly on classical computers when the number of particles exceeds a few tens.
For this reason, quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of
atomic and molecular physics has become a very active field over the past years, 
using ultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions. All of
these approaches have their own strengths and limitations. Here we report an
alternative platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms
trapped in tunable two-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary
geometries, where filling fractions range from 60 to 100 per cent. When excited
to high-energy Rydberg D states, the atoms undergo strong interactions whose
anisotropic character opens the way to simulating exotic matter. We illustrate
the versatility of our system by studying the dynamics of a quantum Ising-like
spin-1/2 system in a transverse field with up to 30 spins, for a variety of
geometries in one and two dimensions, and for a wide range of interaction
strengths. For geometries where the anisotropy is expected to have small effects 
on the dynamics, we find excellent agreement with ab initio simulations of the
spin-1/2 system, while for strongly anisotropic situations the multilevel
structure of the D states has a measurable influence. Our findings establish
arrays of single Rydberg atoms as a versatile platform for the study of quantum
magnetism.

Translation readthrough mitigation.

Arribere JA, Cenik ES, Jain N, Hess GT, Lee CH, Bassik MC, Fire AZ.

A fraction of ribosomes engaged in translation will fail to terminate when
reaching a stop codon, yielding nascent proteins inappropriately extended on
their C termini. Although such extended proteins can interfere with normal
cellular processes, known mechanisms of translational surveillance are
insufficient to protect cells from potential dominant consequences. Here, through
a combination of transgenics and CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing in Caenorhabditis
elegans, we demonstrate a consistent ability of cells to block accumulation of
C-terminal-extended proteins that result from failure to terminate at stop
codons. Sequences encoded by the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) were sufficient to 
lower protein levels. Measurements of mRNA levels and translation suggested a co-
or post-translational mechanism of action for these sequences in C. elegans.
Similar mechanisms evidently operate in human cells, in which we observed a
comparable tendency for translated human 3′ UTR sequences to reduce mature
protein expression in tissue culture assays, including 3′ UTR sequences from the 
hypomorphic ‘Constant Spring’ haemoglobin stop codon variant. We suggest that 3′ 
UTRs may encode peptide sequences that destabilize the attached protein,
providing mitigation of unwelcome and varied translation errors.

Over 50% of patients who survive neuroinvasive infection with West Nile virus
(WNV) exhibit chronic cognitive sequelae. Although thousands of cases of
WNV-mediated memory dysfunction accrue annually, the mechanisms responsible for
these impairments are unknown. The classical complement cascade, a key component 
of innate immune pathogen defence, mediates synaptic pruning by microglia during 
early postnatal development. Here we show that viral infection of adult
hippocampal neurons induces complement-mediated elimination of presynaptic
terminals in a murine WNV neuroinvasive disease model. Inoculation of
WNV-NS5-E218A, a WNV with a mutant NS5(E218A) protein leads to survival rates and
cognitive dysfunction that mirror human WNV neuroinvasive disease.
WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice (recovery defined as survival after acute infection)
display impaired spatial learning and persistence of phagocytic microglia without
loss of hippocampal neurons or volume. Hippocampi from WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered
mice with poor spatial learning show increased expression of genes that drive
synaptic remodelling by microglia via complement. C1QA was upregulated and
localized to microglia, infected neurons and presynaptic terminals during WNV
neuroinvasive disease. Murine and human WNV neuroinvasive disease post-mortem
samples exhibit loss of hippocampal CA3 presynaptic terminals, and murine studies
revealed microglial engulfment of presynaptic terminals during acute infection
and after recovery. Mice with fewer microglia (Il34(-/-) mice with a deficiency
in IL-34 production) or deficiency in complement C3 or C3a receptor were
protected from WNV-induced synaptic terminal loss. Our study provides a new
murine model of WNV-induced spatial memory impairment, and identifies a potential
mechanism underlying neurocognitive impairment in patients recovering from WNV
neuroinvasive disease.

Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the
elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However, computing
the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical
computational methods. This has recently stimulated theoretical effort, using
Feynman's idea of a quantum simulator, to devise schemes for simulating such
theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge
invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be
implemented. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a digital quantum
simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realizing (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics (the Schwinger model) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum
computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger
mechanism, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum
fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of
electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map
the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields in favour of
exotic long-range interactions, which can be directly and efficiently implemented
on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of
particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum
persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement
in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement
generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum
simulation of high-energy theories using atomic physics experiments-the long-term
intention is to extend this approach to real-time quantum simulations of
non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.

The merger of two massive (about 30 solar masses) black holes has been detected
in gravitational waves. This discovery validates recent predictions that massive 
binary black holes would constitute the first detection. Previous calculations,
however, have not sampled the relevant binary-black-hole progenitors--massive,
low-metallicity binary stars--with sufficient accuracy nor included sufficiently 
realistic physics to enable robust predictions to better than several orders of
magnitude. Here we report high-precision numerical simulations of the formation
of binary black holes via the evolution of isolated binary stars, providing a
framework within which to interpret the first gravitational-wave source,
GW150914, and to predict the properties of subsequent binary-black-hole
gravitational-wave events. Our models imply that these events form in an
environment in which the metallicity is less than ten per cent of solar
metallicity, and involve stars with initial masses of 40-100 solar masses that
interact through mass transfer and a common-envelope phase. These progenitor
stars probably formed either about 2 billion years or, with a smaller
probability, 11 billion years after the Big Bang. Most binary black holes form
without supernova explosions, and their spins are nearly unchanged since birth,
but do not have to be parallel. The classical field formation of binary black
holes we propose, with low natal kicks (the velocity of the black hole at birth) 
and restricted common-envelope evolution, produces approximately 40 times more
binary-black-holes mergers than do dynamical formation channels involving
globular clusters; our predicted detection rate of these mergers is comparable to
that from homogeneous evolution channels. Our calculations predict detections of 
about 1,000 black-hole mergers per year with total masses of 20-80 solar masses
once second-generation ground-based gravitational-wave observatories reach full
sensitivity.

Just as quantum electrodynamics describes how electrons are bound in atoms by the
electromagnetic force, mediated by the exchange of photons, quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks are bound inside hadrons by the strong 
force, mediated by the exchange of gluons. QCD seems to allow hadrons constructed
from increasingly many quarks to exist, just as atoms with increasing numbers of 
electrons exist, yet such complex constructions seemed, until recently, not to be
present in nature. Here we describe advances in the spectroscopy of mesons that
are refining our understanding of the rules for predicting hadron structure from 
QCD.

Genetic variation modulates protein expression through both transcriptional and
post-transcriptional mechanisms. To characterize the consequences of natural
genetic diversity on the proteome, here we combine a multiplexed, mass
spectrometry-based method for protein quantification with an emerging outbred
mouse model containing extensive genetic variation from eight inbred founder
strains. By measuring genome-wide transcript and protein expression in livers
from 192 Diversity outbred mice, we identify 2,866 protein quantitative trait
loci (pQTL) with twice as many local as distant genetic variants. These data
support distinct transcriptional and post-transcriptional models underlying the
observed pQTL effects. Using a sensitive approach to mediation analysis, we often
identified a second protein or transcript as the causal mediator of distant pQTL.
Our analysis reveals an extensive network of direct protein-protein interactions.
Finally, we show that local genotype can provide accurate predictions of protein 
abundance in an independent cohort of collaborative cross mice.

Fertilization is an essential biological process in sexual reproduction and
comprises a series of molecular interactions between the sperm and egg. The
fusion of the haploid spermatozoon and oocyte is the culminating event in
mammalian fertilization, enabling the creation of a new, genetically distinct
diploid organism. The merger of two gametes is achieved through a two-step
mechanism in which the sperm protein IZUMO1 on the equatorial segment of the
acrosome-reacted sperm recognizes its receptor, JUNO, on the egg surface. This
recognition is followed by the fusion of the two plasma membranes. IZUMO1 and
JUNO proteins are indispensable for fertilization, as constitutive knockdown of
either protein results in mice that are healthy but infertile. Despite their
central importance in reproductive medicine, the molecular architectures of these
proteins and the details of their functional roles in fertilization are not
known. Here we present the crystal structures of human IZUMO1 and JUNO in unbound
and bound conformations. The human IZUMO1 structure exhibits a distinct boomerang
shape and provides structural insights into the IZUMO family of proteins. Human
IZUMO1 forms a high-affinity complex with JUNO and undergoes a major
conformational change within its N-terminal domain upon binding to the
egg-surface receptor. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of

Membrane fusion and fission are vital for eukaryotic life. For three decades, it 
has been proposed that fusion is mediated by fusion between the proximal leaflets
of two bilayers (hemi-fusion) to produce a hemi-fused structure, followed by
fusion between the distal leaflets, whereas fission is via hemi-fission, which
also produces a hemi-fused structure, followed by full fission. This hypothesis
remained unsupported owing to the lack of observation of hemi-fusion or
hemi-fission in live cells. A competing fusion hypothesis involving protein-lined
pore formation has also been proposed. Here we report the observation of a
hemi-fused Ω-shaped structure in live neuroendocrine chromaffin cells and
pancreatic β-cells, visualized using confocal and super-resolution stimulated
emission depletion microscopy. This structure is generated from fusion pore
opening or closure (fission) at the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, the transition
to full fusion or fission is determined by competition between fusion and
calcium/dynamin-dependent fission mechanisms, and is notably slow (seconds to
tens of seconds) in a substantial fraction of the events. These results provide
key missing evidence in support of the hemi-fusion and hemi-fission hypothesis in
live cells, and reveal the hemi-fused intermediate as a key structure controlling
fusion and fission, as fusion and fission mechanisms compete to determine the
transition to fusion or fission.

Small molecules are powerful tools for investigating protein function and can
serve as leads for new therapeutics. Most human proteins, however, lack
small-molecule ligands, and entire protein classes are considered 'undruggable'. 
Fragment-based ligand discovery can identify small-molecule probes for proteins
that have proven difficult to target using high-throughput screening of complex
compound libraries. Although reversibly binding ligands are commonly pursued,
covalent fragments provide an alternative route to small-molecule probes,
including those that can access regions of proteins that are difficult to target 
through binding affinity alone. Here we report a quantitative analysis of
cysteine-reactive small-molecule fragments screened against thousands of proteins
in human proteomes and cells. Covalent ligands were identified for >700 cysteines
found in both druggable proteins and proteins deficient in chemical probes,
including transcription factors, adaptor/scaffolding proteins, and
uncharacterized proteins. Among the atypical ligand-protein interactions
discovered were compounds that react preferentially with pro- (inactive)
caspases. We used these ligands to distinguish extrinsic apoptosis pathways in
human cell lines versus primary human T cells, showing that the former is largely
mediated by caspase-8 while the latter depends on both caspase-8 and -10.
Fragment-based covalent ligand discovery provides a greatly expanded portrait of 
the ligandable proteome and furnishes compounds that can illuminate protein
functions in native biological systems.

Most bacteriophages are tailed bacteriophages with an isometric or a prolate head
attached to a long contractile, long non-contractile, or short non-contractile
tail. The tail is a complex machine that plays a central role in host cell
recognition and attachment, cell wall and membrane penetration, and viral genome 
ejection. The mechanisms involved in the penetration of the inner host cell
membrane by bacteriophage tails are not well understood. Here we describe
structural and functional studies of the bacteriophage ϕ29 tail knob protein gene
product 9 (gp9). The 2.0 Å crystal structure of gp9 shows that six gp9 molecules 
form a hexameric tube structure with six flexible hydrophobic loops blocking one 
end of the tube before DNA ejection. Sequence and structural analyses suggest
that the loops in the tube could be membrane active. Further biochemical assays
and electron microscopy structural analyses show that the six hydrophobic loops
in the tube exit upon DNA ejection and form a channel that spans the lipid
bilayer of the membrane and allows the release of the bacteriophage genomic DNA, 
suggesting that cell membrane penetration involves a pore-forming mechanism
similar to that of certain non-enveloped eukaryotic viruses. A search of other
phage tail proteins identified similar hydrophobic loops, which indicates that a 
common mechanism might be used for membrane penetration by prokaryotic viruses.
These findings suggest that although prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses use
apparently very different mechanisms for infection, they have evolved similar
mechanisms for breaching the cell membrane.

Fertilization is a fundamental process in sexual reproduction, creating a new
individual through the combination of male and female gametes. The IZUMO1 sperm
membrane protein and its counterpart oocyte receptor JUNO have been identified as
essential factors for sperm-oocyte interaction and fusion. However, the mechanism
underlying their specific recognition remains poorly defined. Here, we show the
crystal structures of human IZUMO1, JUNO and the IZUMO1-JUNO complex,
establishing the structural basis for the IZUMO1-JUNO-mediated sperm-oocyte
interaction. IZUMO1 exhibits an elongated rod-shaped structure comprised of a
helical bundle IZUMO domain and an immunoglobulin-like domain that are each
firmly anchored to an intervening β-hairpin region through conserved disulfide
bonds. The central β-hairpin region of IZUMO1 provides the main platform for JUNO
binding, while the surface located behind the putative JUNO ligand binding pocket
is involved in IZUMO1 binding. Structure-based mutagenesis analysis confirms the 
biological importance of the IZUMO1-JUNO interaction. This structure provides a
major step towards elucidating an essential phase of fertilization and it will
contribute to the development of new therapeutic interventions for fertility,
such as contraceptive agents.

Autophagy is a highly conserved self-digestion process, which is essential for
maintaining homeostasis and viability in response to nutrient starvation.
Although the components of autophagy in the cytoplasm have been well studied, the
molecular basis for the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of autophagy is
poorly understood. Here we identify co-activator-associated arginine
methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) as a crucial component of autophagy in mammals.
Notably, CARM1 stability is regulated by the SKP2-containing SCF
(SKP1-cullin1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase in the nucleus, but not in the
cytoplasm, under nutrient-rich conditions. Furthermore, we show that nutrient
starvation results in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent
phosphorylation of FOXO3a in the nucleus, which in turn transcriptionally
represses SKP2. This repression leads to increased levels of CARM1 protein and
subsequent increases in histone H3 Arg17 dimethylation. Genome-wide analyses
reveal that CARM1 exerts transcriptional co-activator function on
autophagy-related and lysosomal genes through transcription factor EB (TFEB). Our
findings demonstrate that CARM1-dependent histone arginine methylation is a
crucial nuclear event in autophagy, and identify a new signalling axis of
AMPK-SKP2-CARM1 in the regulation of autophagy induction after nutrient
starvation.

Rocaglates convert DEAD-box protein eIF4A into a sequence-selective translational
repressor.

Rocaglamide A (RocA) typifies a class of protein synthesis inhibitors that
selectively kill aneuploid tumour cells and repress translation of specific
messenger RNAs. RocA targets eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), an
ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase; its messenger RNA selectivity is proposed to
reflect highly structured 5' untranslated regions that depend strongly on
eIF4A-mediated unwinding. However, rocaglate treatment may not phenocopy the loss
of eIF4A activity, as these drugs actually increase the affinity between eIF4A
and RNA. Here we show that secondary structure in 5' untranslated regions is only
a minor determinant for RocA selectivity and that RocA does not repress
translation by reducing eIF4A availability. Rather, in vitro and in cells, RocA
specifically clamps eIF4A onto polypurine sequences in an ATP-independent manner.
This artificially clamped eIF4A blocks 43S scanning, leading to premature,
upstream translation initiation and reducing protein expression from transcripts 
bearing the RocA-eIF4A target sequence. In elucidating the mechanism of selective
translation repression by this lead anti-cancer compound, we provide an example
of a drug stabilizing sequence-selective RNA-protein interactions.

Precise regulation of calcium homeostasis is essential for many physiological
functions. The Ca(2+)-selective transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPV5
and TRPV6 play vital roles in calcium homeostasis as Ca(2+) uptake channels in
epithelial tissues. Detailed structural bases for their assembly and Ca(2+)
permeation remain obscure. Here we report the crystal structure of rat TRPV6 at
3.25 Å resolution. The overall architecture of TRPV6 reveals shared and unique
features compared with other TRP channels. Intracellular domains engage in
extensive interactions to form an intracellular 'skirt' involved in allosteric
modulation. In the K(+) channel-like transmembrane domain, Ca(2+) selectivity is 
determined by direct coordination of Ca(2+) by a ring of aspartate side chains in
the selectivity filter. On the basis of crystallographically identified
cation-binding sites at the pore axis and extracellular vestibule, we propose a
Ca(2+) permeation mechanism. Our results provide a structural foundation for
understanding the regulation of epithelial Ca(2+) uptake and its role in
pathophysiology.

The stability of spontaneous electrical polarization in ferroelectrics is
fundamental to many of their current applications, which range from the simple
electric cigarette lighter to non-volatile random access memories. Research on
nanoscale ferroelectrics reveals that their behaviour is profoundly different
from that in bulk ferroelectrics, which could lead to new phenomena with
potential for future devices. As ferroelectrics become thinner, maintaining a
stable polarization becomes increasingly challenging. On the other hand,
intentionally destabilizing this polarization can cause the effective electric
permittivity of a ferroelectric to become negative, enabling it to behave as a
negative capacitance when integrated in a heterostructure. Negative capacitance
has been proposed as a way of overcoming fundamental limitations on the power
consumption of field-effect transistors. However, experimental demonstrations of 
this phenomenon remain contentious. The prevalent interpretations based on
homogeneous polarization models are difficult to reconcile with the expected
strong tendency for domain formation, but the effect of domains on negative
capacitance has received little attention. Here we report negative capacitance in
a model system of multidomain ferroelectric-dielectric superlattices across a
wide range of temperatures, in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases.
Using a phenomenological model, we show that domain-wall motion not only gives
rise to negative permittivity, but can also enhance, rather than limit, its
temperature range. Our first-principles-based atomistic simulations provide
detailed microscopic insight into the origin of this phenomenon, identifying the 
dominant contribution of near-interface layers and paving the way for its future 
exploitation.

Enzymes that contain metal ions--that is, metalloenzymes--possess the reactivity 
of a transition metal centre and the potential of molecular evolution to modulate
the reactivity and substrate-selectivity of the system. By exploiting substrate
promiscuity and protein engineering, the scope of reactions catalysed by native
metalloenzymes has been expanded recently to include abiological transformations.
However, this strategy is limited by the inherent reactivity of metal centres in 
native metalloenzymes. To overcome this limitation, artificial metalloproteins
have been created by incorporating complete, noble-metal complexes within
proteins lacking native metal sites. The interactions of the substrate with the
protein in these systems are, however, distinct from those with the native
protein because the metal complex occupies the substrate binding site. At the
intersection of these approaches lies a third strategy, in which the native metal
of a metalloenzyme is replaced with an abiological metal with reactivity
different from that of the metal in a native protein. This strategy could create 
artificial enzymes for abiological catalysis within the natural substrate binding
site of an enzyme that can be subjected to directed evolution. Here we report the
formal replacement of iron in Fe-porphyrin IX (Fe-PIX) proteins with abiological,
noble metals to create enzymes that catalyse reactions not catalysed by native
Fe-enzymes or other metalloenzymes. In particular, we prepared modified
myoglobins containing an Ir(Me) site that catalyse the functionalization of C-H
bonds to form C-C bonds by carbene insertion and add carbenes to both
β-substituted vinylarenes and unactivated aliphatic α-olefins. We conducted
directed evolution of the Ir(Me)-myoglobin and generated mutants that form either
enantiomer of the products of C-H insertion and catalyse the enantio- and
diastereoselective cyclopropanation of unactivated olefins. The presented method 
of preparing artificial haem proteins containing abiological metal porphyrins
sets the stage for the generation of artificial enzymes from innumerable
combinations of PIX-protein scaffolds and unnatural metal cofactors to catalyse a
wide range of abiological transformations.

Polymer cold-drawing is a process in which tensile stress reduces the diameter of
a drawn fibre (or thickness of a drawn film) and orients the polymeric chains.
Cold-drawing has long been used in industrial applications, including the
production of flexible fibres with high tensile strength such as polyester and
nylon. However, cold-drawing of a composite structure has been less studied. Here
we show that in a multimaterial fibre composed of a brittle core embedded in a
ductile polymer cladding, cold-drawing results in a surprising phenomenon:
controllable and sequential fragmentation of the core to produce uniformly sized 
rods along metres of fibre, rather than the expected random or chaotic
fragmentation. These embedded structures arise from mechanical-geometric
instabilities associated with 'neck' propagation. Embedded, structured
multimaterial threads with complex transverse geometry are thus fragmented into a
periodic train of rods held stationary in the polymer cladding. These rods can
then be easily extracted via selective dissolution of the cladding, or can
self-heal by thermal restoration to re-form the brittle thread. Our method is
also applicable to composites with flat rather than cylindrical geometries, in
which case cold-drawing leads to the break-up of an embedded or coated brittle
film into narrow parallel strips that are aligned normally to the drawing axis. A
range of materials was explored to establish the universality of this effect,
including silicon, germanium, gold, glasses, silk, polystyrene, biodegradable
polymers and ice. We observe, and verify through nonlinear finite-element
simulations, a linear relationship between the smallest transverse scale and the 
longitudinal break-up period. These results may lead to the development of
dynamical and thermoreversible camouflaging via a nanoscale Venetian-blind
effect, and the fabrication of large-area structured surfaces that facilitate
high-sensitivity bio-detection.

Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate action potentials in most neurons,
including primary afferent nerve fibres of the pain pathway. Local anaesthetics
block pain through non-specific actions at all Nav channels, but the discovery of
selective modulators would facilitate the analysis of individual subtypes of
these channels and their contributions to chemical, mechanical, or thermal pain. 
Here we identify and characterize spider (Heteroscodra maculata) toxins that
selectively activate the Nav1.1 subtype, the role of which in nociception and
pain has not been elucidated. We use these probes to show that Nav1.1-expressing 
fibres are modality-specific nociceptors: their activation elicits robust pain
behaviours without neurogenic inflammation and produces profound hypersensitivity
to mechanical, but not thermal, stimuli. In the gut, high-threshold
mechanosensitive fibres also express Nav1.1 and show enhanced toxin sensitivity
in a mouse model of irritable bowel syndrome. Together, these findings establish 
an unexpected role for Nav1.1 channels in regulating the excitability of sensory 
nerve fibres that mediate mechanical pain.

Strong-field laser excitation of solids can produce extremely nonlinear
electronic and optical behaviour. As recently demonstrated, this includes the
generation of high harmonics extending into the vacuum-ultraviolet and
extreme-ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. High harmonic
generation is shown to occur fundamentally differently in solids and in dilute
atomic gases. How the microscopic mechanisms in the solid and the gas differ
remains a topic of intense debate. Here we report a direct comparison of high
harmonic generation in the solid and gas phases of argon and krypton. Owing to
the weak van der Waals interaction, rare (noble)-gas solids are a near-ideal
medium in which to study the role of high density and periodicity in the
generation process. We find that the high harmonic generation spectra from the
rare-gas solids exhibit multiple plateaus extending well beyond the atomic limit 
of the corresponding gas-phase harmonics measured under similar conditions. The
appearance of multiple plateaus indicates strong interband couplings involving
multiple single-particle bands. We also compare the dependence of the solid and
gas harmonic yield on laser ellipticity and find that they are similar,
suggesting the importance of electron-hole recollision in these solids. This
implies that gas-phase methods such as polarization gating for attosecond pulse
generation and orbital tomography could be realized in solids.

Chemical modifications of RNA have essential roles in a vast range of cellular
processes. N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is an abundant internal modification in
messenger RNA and long non-coding RNA that can be dynamically added and removed
by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) and demethylases, respectively. An MTase
complex comprising methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like
14 (METTL14) efficiently catalyses methyl group transfer. In contrast to the
well-studied DNA MTase, the exact roles of these two RNA MTases in the complex
remain to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal structures of the
METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer with MTase domains in the ligand-free, S-adenosyl
methionine (AdoMet)-bound and S-adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy)-bound states, with
resolutions of 1.9, 1.71 and 1.61 Å, respectively. Both METTL3 and METTL14 adopt 
a class I MTase fold and they interact with each other via an extensive hydrogen 
bonding network, generating a positively charged groove. Notably, AdoMet was
observed in only the METTL3 pocket and not in METTL14. Combined with biochemical 
analysis, these results suggest that in the m(6)A MTase complex, METTL3 primarily
functions as the catalytic core, while METTL14 serves as an RNA-binding platform,
reminiscent of the target recognition domain of DNA N(6)-adenine MTase. This
structural information provides an important framework for the functional
investigation of m(6)A.

The existence of domain walls, which separate regions of different polarization, 
can influence the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and electronic
properties of ferroelectric materials. In particular, domain-wall motion is
crucial for polarization switching, which is characterized by the hysteresis loop
that is a signature feature of ferroelectric materials. Experimentally, the
observed dynamics of polarization switching and domain-wall motion are usually
explained as the behaviour of an elastic interface pinned by a random potential
that is generated by defects, which appear to be strongly sample-dependent and
affected by various elastic, microstructural and other extrinsic effects.
Theoretically, connecting the zero-kelvin, first-principles-based, microscopic
quantities of a sample with finite-temperature, macroscopic properties such as
the coercive field is critical for material design and device performance; and
the lack of such a connection has prevented the use of techniques based on ab
initio calculations for high-throughput computational materials discovery. Here
we use molecular dynamics simulations of 90° domain walls (separating domains
with orthogonal polarization directions) in the ferroelectric material PbTiO3 to 
provide microscopic insights that enable the construction of a simple, universal,
nucleation-and-growth-based analytical model that quantifies the dynamics of many
types of domain walls in various ferroelectrics. We then predict the temperature 
and frequency dependence of hysteresis loops and coercive fields at finite
temperatures from first principles. We find that, even in the absence of defects,
the intrinsic temperature and field dependence of the domain-wall velocity can be
described with a nonlinear creep-like region and a depinning-like region. Our
model enables quantitative estimation of coercive fields, which agree well with
experimental results for ceramics and thin films. This agreement between model
and experiment suggests that, despite the complexity of ferroelectric materials, 
typical ferroelectric switching is largely governed by a simple, universal
mechanism of intrinsic domain-wall motion, providing an efficient framework for
predicting and optimizing the properties of ferroelectric materials.

The first-passage time, defined as the time a random walker takes to reach a
target point in a confining domain, is a key quantity in the theory of stochastic
processes. Its importance comes from its crucial role in quantifying the
efficiency of processes as varied as diffusion-limited reactions, target search
processes or the spread of diseases. Most methods of determining the properties
of first-passage time in confined domains have been limited to Markovian
(memoryless) processes. However, as soon as the random walker interacts with its 
environment, memory effects cannot be neglected: that is, the future motion of
the random walker does not depend only on its current position, but also on its
past trajectory. Examples of non-Markovian dynamics include single-file diffusion
in narrow channels, or the motion of a tracer particle either attached to a
polymeric chain or diffusing in simple or complex fluids such as nematics, dense 
soft colloids or viscoelastic solutions. Here we introduce an analytical approach
to calculate, in the limit of a large confining volume, the mean first-passage
time of a Gaussian non-Markovian random walker to a target. The non-Markovian
features of the dynamics are encompassed by determining the statistical
properties of the fictitious trajectory that the random walker would follow after
the first-passage event takes place, which are shown to govern the first-passage 
time kinetics. This analysis is applicable to a broad range of stochastic
processes, which may be correlated at long times. Our theoretical predictions are
confirmed by numerical simulations for several examples of non-Markovian
processes, including the case of fractional Brownian motion in one and higher
dimensions. These results reveal, on the basis of Gaussian processes, the
importance of memory effects in first-passage statistics of non-Markovian random 
walkers in confinement.

Whether protein synthesis and cellular stress response pathways interact to
control stem cell function is currently unknown. Here we show that mouse skin
stem cells synthesize less protein than their immediate progenitors in vivo, even
when forced to proliferate. Our analyses reveal that activation of stress
response pathways drives both a global reduction of protein synthesis and altered
translational programmes that together promote stem cell functions and
tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we show that inhibition of post-transcriptional
cytosine-5 methylation locks tumour-initiating cells in this distinct
translational inhibition programme. Paradoxically, this inhibition renders stem
cells hypersensitive to cytotoxic stress, as tumour regeneration after treatment 
with 5-fluorouracil is blocked. Thus, stem cells must revoke translation
inhibition pathways to regenerate a tissue or tumour.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) arises after transformation of a haemopoietic
stem cell (HSC) by the protein-tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. Direct inhibition of
BCR-ABL kinase has revolutionized disease management, but fails to eradicate
leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), which maintain CML. LSCs are independent of BCR-ABL 
for survival, providing a rationale for identifying and targeting
kinase-independent pathways. Here we show--using proteomics, transcriptomics and 
network analyses--that in human LSCs, aberrantly expressed proteins, in both
imatinib-responder and non-responder patients, are modulated in concert with p53 
(also known as TP53) and c-MYC regulation. Perturbation of both p53 and c-MYC,
and not BCR-ABL itself, leads to synergistic cell kill, differentiation, and near
elimination of transplantable human LSCs in mice, while sparing normal HSCs. This
unbiased systems approach targeting connected nodes exemplifies a novel precision
medicine strategy providing evidence that LSCs can be eradicated.

Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is widely used by organic chemists to
functionalize aromatic molecules, and it is the most commonly used method to
generate arenes that contain (18)F for use in positron-emission tomography (PET) 
imaging. A wide range of nucleophiles exhibit SNAr reactivity, and the
operational simplicity of the reaction means that the transformation can be
conducted reliably and on large scales. During SNAr, attack of a nucleophile at a
carbon atom bearing a 'leaving group' leads to a negatively charged intermediate 
called a Meisenheimer complex. Only arenes with electron-withdrawing substituents
can sufficiently stabilize the resulting build-up of negative charge during
Meisenheimer complex formation, limiting the scope of SNAr reactions: the most
common SNAr substrates contain strong π-acceptors in the ortho and/or para
position(s). Here we present an unusual concerted nucleophilic aromatic
substitution reaction (CSNAr) that is not limited to electron-poor arenes,
because it does not proceed via a Meisenheimer intermediate. We show a phenol
deoxyfluorination reaction for which CSNAr is favoured over a stepwise
displacement. Mechanistic insights enabled us to develop a
functional-group-tolerant (18)F-deoxyfluorination reaction of phenols, which can 
be used to synthesize (18)F-PET probes. Selective (18)F introduction, without the
need for the common, but cumbersome, azeotropic drying of (18)F, can now be
accomplished from phenols as starting materials, and provides access to
(18)F-labelled compounds not accessible through conventional chemistry.

Direct lineage reprogramming represents a remarkable conversion of cellular and
transcriptome states. However, the intermediate stages through which individual
cells progress during reprogramming are largely undefined. Here we use
single-cell RNA sequencing at multiple time points to dissect direct
reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. By
deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by
transcriptome similarity, we find that the molecular reprogramming path is
remarkably continuous. Overexpression of the proneural pioneer factor Ascl1
results in a well-defined initialization, causing cells to exit the cell cycle
and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural transcription factors. The
initial transcriptional response is relatively homogeneous among fibroblasts,
suggesting that the early steps are not limiting for productive reprogramming.
Instead, the later emergence of a competing myogenic program and variable
transgene dynamics over time appear to be the major efficiency limits of direct
reprogramming. Moreover, a transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target 
cell programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive
reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding
transcriptome states during lineage differentiation.

Developmental specification of germ cells lies at the heart of inheritance, as
germ cells contain all of the genetic and epigenetic information transmitted
between generations. The critical developmental event distinguishing germline
from somatic lineages is the differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs),
precursors of sex-specific gametes that produce an entire organism upon
fertilization. Germ cells toggle between uni- and pluripotent states as they
exhibit their own 'latent' form of pluripotency. For example, PGCs express a
number of transcription factors in common with embryonic stem (ES) cells,
including OCT4 (encoded by Pou5f1), SOX2, NANOG and PRDM14 (refs 2, 3, 4). A
biochemical mechanism by which these transcription factors converge on chromatin 
to produce the dramatic rearrangements underlying ES-cell- and PGC-specific
transcriptional programs remains poorly understood. Here we identify a novel
co-repressor protein, CBFA2T2, that regulates pluripotency and germline
specification in mice. Cbfa2t2(-/-) mice display severe defects in PGC maturation
and epigenetic reprogramming. CBFA2T2 forms a biochemical complex with PRDM14, a 
germline-specific transcription factor. Mechanistically, CBFA2T2 oligomerizes to 
form a scaffold upon which PRDM14 and OCT4 are stabilized on chromatin. Thus, in 
contrast to the traditional 'passenger' role of a co-repressor, CBFA2T2 functions
synergistically with transcription factors at the crossroads of the fundamental
developmental plasticity between uni- and pluripotency.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are maternally inherited and are associated
with a broad range of debilitating and fatal diseases. Reproductive technologies 
designed to uncouple the inheritance of mtDNA from nuclear DNA may enable
affected women to have a genetically related child with a greatly reduced risk of
mtDNA disease. Here we report the first preclinical studies on pronuclear
transplantation (PNT). Surprisingly, techniques used in proof-of-concept studies 
involving abnormally fertilized human zygotes were not well tolerated by normally
fertilized zygotes. We have therefore developed an alternative approach based on 
transplanting pronuclei shortly after completion of meiosis rather than shortly
before the first mitotic division. This promotes efficient development to the
blastocyst stage with no detectable effect on aneuploidy or gene expression.
After optimization, mtDNA carryover was reduced to <2% in the majority (79%) of
PNT blastocysts. The importance of reducing carryover to the lowest possible
levels is highlighted by a progressive increase in heteroplasmy in a stem cell
line derived from a PNT blastocyst with 4% mtDNA carryover. We conclude that PNT 
has the potential to reduce the risk of mtDNA disease, but it may not guarantee
prevention.

Neural activation increases blood flow locally. This vascular signal is used by
functional imaging techniques to infer the location and strength of neural
activity. However, the precise spatial scale over which neural and vascular
signals are correlated is unknown. Furthermore, the relative role of synaptic and
spiking activity in driving haemodynamic signals is controversial. Previous
studies recorded local field potentials as a measure of synaptic activity
together with spiking activity and low-resolution haemodynamic imaging. Here we
used two-photon microscopy to measure sensory-evoked responses of individual
blood vessels (dilation, blood velocity) while imaging synaptic and spiking
activity in the surrounding tissue using fluorescent glutamate and calcium
sensors. In cat primary visual cortex, where neurons are clustered by their
preference for stimulus orientation, we discovered new maps for excitatory
synaptic activity, which were organized similarly to those for spiking activity
but were less selective for stimulus orientation and direction. We generated
tuning curves for individual vessel responses for the first time and found that
parenchymal vessels in cortical layer 2/3 were orientation selective.
Neighbouring penetrating arterioles had different orientation preferences. Pial
surface arteries in cats, as well as surface arteries and penetrating arterioles 
in rat visual cortex (where orientation maps do not exist), responded to visual
stimuli but had no orientation selectivity. We integrated synaptic or spiking
responses around individual parenchymal vessels in cats and established that the 
vascular and neural responses had the same orientation preference. However,
synaptic and spiking responses were more selective than vascular
responses--vessels frequently responded robustly to stimuli that evoked little to
no neural activity in the surrounding tissue. Thus, local neural and haemodynamic
signals were partly decoupled. Together, these results indicate that intrinsic
cortical properties, such as propagation of vascular dilation between
neighbouring columns, need to be accounted for when decoding haemodynamic
signals.

Particles with directional interactions are promising building blocks for new
functional materials and may serve as models for biological structures. Mutually 
attractive nanoparticles that are deformable owing to flexible surface groups,
for example, may spontaneously order themselves into strings, sheets and large
vesicles. Furthermore, anisotropic colloids with attractive patches can
self-assemble into open lattices and the colloidal equivalents of molecules and
micelles. However, model systems that combine mutual attraction, anisotropy and
deformability have not yet been realized. Here we synthesize colloidal particles 
that combine these three characteristics and obtain self-assembled microcapsules.
We propose that mutual attraction and deformability induce directional
interactions via colloidal bond hybridization. Our particles contain both
mutually attractive and repulsive surface groups that are flexible. Analogously
to the simplest chemical bond--in which two isotropic orbitals hybridize into the
molecular orbital of H2--these flexible groups redistribute on binding. Via
colloidal bond hybridization, isotropic spheres self-assemble into planar
monolayers, whereas anisotropic snowman-shaped particles self-assemble into
hollow monolayer microcapsules. A modest change in the building blocks thus
results in much greater complexity of the self-assembled structures. In other
words, these relatively simple building blocks self-assemble into markedly more
complex structures than do similar particles that are isotropic or
non-deformable.

Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is a pre-malignant lesion that can progress 
to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal malignancy marked by its
late stage at clinical presentation and profound drug resistance. The genomic
alterations that commonly occur in pancreatic cancer include activation of KRAS2 
and inactivation of p53 and SMAD4 (refs 2-4). So far, however, it has been
challenging to target these pathways therapeutically; thus the search for other
key mediators of pancreatic cancer growth remains an important endeavour. Here we
show that the stem cell determinant Musashi (Msi) is a critical element of
pancreatic cancer progression both in genetic models and in patient-derived
xenografts. Specifically, we developed Msi reporter mice that allowed image-based
tracking of stem cell signals within cancers, revealing that Msi expression rises
as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia progresses to adenocarcinoma, and that
Msi-expressing cells are key drivers of pancreatic cancer: they preferentially
harbour the capacity to propagate adenocarcinoma, are enriched in circulating
tumour cells, and are markedly drug resistant. This population could be
effectively targeted by deletion of either Msi1 or Msi2, which led to a striking 
defect in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to
adenocarcinoma and an improvement in overall survival. Msi inhibition also
blocked the growth of primary patient-derived tumours, suggesting that this
signal is required for human disease. To define the translational potential of
this work we developed antisense oligonucleotides against Msi; these showed
reliable tumour penetration, uptake and target inhibition, and effectively
blocked pancreatic cancer growth. Collectively, these studies highlight Msi
reporters as a unique tool to identify therapy resistance, and define Msi
signalling as a central regulator of pancreatic cancer.

DNA replication is tightly controlled to ensure accurate inheritance of genetic
information. In all organisms, initiator proteins possessing AAA+ (ATPases
associated with various cellular activities) domains bind replication origins to 
license new rounds of DNA synthesis. In bacteria the master initiator protein,
DnaA, is highly conserved and has two crucial DNA binding activities. DnaA
monomers recognize the replication origin (oriC) by binding double-stranded DNA
sequences (DnaA-boxes); subsequently, DnaA filaments assemble and promote duplex 
unwinding by engaging and stretching a single DNA strand. While the specificity
for duplex DnaA-boxes by DnaA has been appreciated for over 30 years, the
sequence specificity for single-strand DNA binding has remained unknown. Here we 
identify a new indispensable bacterial replication origin element composed of a
repeating trinucleotide motif that we term the DnaA-trio. We show that the
function of the DnaA-trio is to stabilize DnaA filaments on a single DNA strand, 
thus providing essential precision to this binding mechanism. Bioinformatic
analysis detects DnaA-trios in replication origins throughout the bacterial
kingdom, indicating that this element is part of the core oriC structure. The
discovery and characterization of the novel DnaA-trio extends our fundamental
understanding of bacterial DNA replication initiation, and because of the
conserved structure of AAA+ initiator proteins these findings raise the
possibility of specific recognition motifs within replication origins of higher
organisms.

Lymphoid organs, in which antigen presenting cells (APCs) are in close proximity 
to T cells, are the ideal microenvironment for efficient priming and
amplification of T-cell responses. However, the systemic delivery of vaccine
antigens into dendritic cells (DCs) is hampered by various technical challenges. 
Here we show that DCs can be targeted precisely and effectively in vivo using
intravenously administered RNA-lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) based on well-known lipid
carriers by optimally adjusting net charge, without the need for
functionalization of particles with molecular ligands. The LPX protects RNA from 
extracellular ribonucleases and mediates its efficient uptake and expression of
the encoded antigen by DC populations and macrophages in various lymphoid
compartments. RNA-LPX triggers interferon-α (IFNα) release by plasmacytoid DCs
and macrophages. Consequently, DC maturation in situ and inflammatory immune
mechanisms reminiscent of those in the early systemic phase of viral infection
are activated. We show that RNA-LPX encoding viral or mutant neo-antigens or
endogenous self-antigens induce strong effector and memory T-cell responses, and 
mediate potent IFNα-dependent rejection of progressive tumours. A phase I
dose-escalation trial testing RNA-LPX that encode shared tumour antigens is
ongoing. In the first three melanoma patients treated at a low-dose level, IFNα
and strong antigen-specific T-cell responses were induced, supporting the
identified mode of action and potency. As any polypeptide-based antigen can be
encoded as RNA, RNA-LPX represent a universally applicable vaccine class for
systemic DC targeting and synchronized induction of both highly potent adaptive
as well as type-I-IFN-mediated innate immune mechanisms for cancer immunotherapy.

When integral membrane proteins are visualized in detergents or other artificial 
systems, an important layer of information is lost regarding lipid interactions
and their effects on protein structure. This is especially relevant to proteins
for which lipids have both structural and regulatory roles. Here we demonstrate
the power of combining electron cryo-microscopy with lipid nanodisc technology to
ascertain the structure of the rat TRPV1 ion channel in a native bilayer
environment. Using this approach, we determined the locations of annular and
regulatory lipids and showed that specific phospholipid interactions enhance
binding of a spider toxin to TRPV1 through formation of a tripartite complex.
Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol lipids occupy the binding site for capsaicin
and other vanilloid ligands, suggesting a mechanism whereby chemical or thermal
stimuli elicit channel activation by promoting the release of bioactive lipids
from a critical allosteric regulatory site.

Successful treatment of many patients with advanced cancer using antibodies
against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; also known as PDCD1) and its ligand
(PD-L1; also known as CD274) has highlighted the critical importance of
PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune escape in cancer development. However, the genetic
basis for the immune escape has not been fully elucidated, with the exception of 
elevated PD-L1 expression by gene amplification and utilization of an ectopic
promoter by translocation, as reported in Hodgkin and other B-cell lymphomas, as 
well as stomach adenocarcinoma. Here we show a unique genetic mechanism of immune
escape caused by structural variations (SVs) commonly disrupting the 3' region of
the PD-L1 gene. Widely affecting multiple common human cancer types, including
adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (27%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (8%), and
stomach adenocarcinoma (2%), these SVs invariably lead to a marked elevation of
aberrant PD-L1 transcripts that are stabilized by truncation of the
3'-untranslated region (UTR). Disruption of the Pd-l1 3'-UTR in mice enables
immune evasion of EG7-OVA tumour cells with elevated Pd-l1 expression in vivo,
which is effectively inhibited by Pd-1/Pd-l1 blockade, supporting the role of
relevant SVs in clonal selection through immune evasion. Our findings not only
unmask a novel regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 expression, but also suggest that
PD-L1 3'-UTR disruption could serve as a genetic marker to identify cancers that 
actively evade anti-tumour immunity through PD-L1 overexpression.

Interplate megathrust earthquakes have inflicted catastrophic damage on human
society. Such an earthquake is predicted to occur in the near future along the
Nankai Trough off southwestern Japan--an economically active and densely
populated area in which megathrust earthquakes have already occurred. Megathrust 
earthquakes are the result of a plate-subduction mechanism and occur at
slip-deficit regions (also known as 'coupling' regions), where friction prevents 
plates from slipping against each other and the accumulated energy is eventually 
released forcefully. Many studies have attempted to capture distributions of
slip-deficit rates (SDRs) in order to predict earthquakes. However, these studies
could not obtain a complete view of the earthquake source region, because they
had no seafloor geodetic data. The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of
the Japan Coast Guard (JHOD) has been developing a precise and sustainable
seafloor geodetic observation network in this subduction zone to obtain
information related to offshore SDRs. Here, we present seafloor geodetic
observation data and an offshore interplate SDR-distribution model. Our data
suggest that most offshore regions in this subduction zone have positive SDRs.
Specifically, our observations indicate previously unknown regions of high SDR
that will be important for tsunami disaster mitigation, and regions of low SDR
that are consistent with distributions of shallow slow earthquakes and subducting
seamounts. This is the first direct evidence that coupling conditions might be
related to these seismological and geological phenomena. Our findings provide
information for inferring megathrust earthquake scenarios and interpreting
research on the Nankai Trough subduction zone.

The solid, central part of a comet--its nucleus--is subject to destructive
processes, which cause nuclei to split at a rate of about 0.01 per year per
comet. These destructive events are due to a range of possible thermophysical
effects; however, the geophysical expressions of these effects are unknown.
Separately, over two-thirds of comet nuclei that have been imaged at high
resolution show bilobate shapes, including the nucleus of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P), visited by the Rosetta spacecraft. Analysis of
the Rosetta observations suggests that 67P's components were brought together at 
low speed after their separate formation. Here, we study the structure and
dynamics of 67P's nucleus. We find that sublimation torques have caused the
nucleus to spin up in the past to form the large cracks observed on its neck.
However, the chaotic evolution of its spin state has so far forestalled its
splitting, although it should eventually reach a rapid enough spin rate to do so.
Once this occurs, the separated components will be unable to escape each other;
they will orbit each other for a time, ultimately undergoing a low-speed merger
that will result in a new bilobate configuration. The components of four other
imaged bilobate nuclei have volume ratios that are consistent with a similar
reconfiguration cycle, pointing to such cycles as a fundamental process in the
evolution of short-period comet nuclei. It has been shown that comets were not
strong contributors to the so-called late heavy bombardment about 4 billion years
ago. The reconfiguration process suggested here would preferentially decimate
comet nuclei during migration to the inner solar system, perhaps explaining this 
lack of a substantial cometary flux.

The drug/metabolite transporter (DMT) superfamily is a large group of membrane
transporters ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea, and includes
exporters for a remarkably wide range of substrates, such as toxic compounds and 
metabolites. YddG is a bacterial DMT protein that expels aromatic amino acids and
exogenous toxic compounds, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis. Here we 
present structural and functional analyses of YddG. Using liposome-based
analyses, we show that Escherichia coli and Starkeya novella YddG export various 
amino acids. The crystal structure of S. novella YddG at 2.4 Å resolution reveals
a new membrane transporter topology, with ten transmembrane segments in an
outward-facing state. The overall structure is basket-shaped, with a large
substrate-binding cavity at the centre of the molecule, and is composed of
inverted structural repeats related by two-fold pseudo-symmetry. On the basis of 
this intramolecular symmetry, we propose a structural model for the inward-facing
state and a mechanism of the conformational change for substrate transport, which
we confirmed by biochemical analyses. These findings provide a structural basis
for the mechanism of transport of DMT superfamily proteins.

The fine structures of proteins, such as the positions of hydrogen atoms,
distributions of valence electrons and orientations of bound waters, are critical
factors for determining the dynamic and chemical properties of proteins. Such
information cannot be obtained by conventional protein X-ray analyses at
3.0-1.5 Å resolution, in which amino acids are fitted into atomically unresolved 
electron-density maps and refinement calculations are performed under strong
restraints. Therefore, we usually supplement the information on hydrogen atoms
and valence electrons in proteins with pre-existing common knowledge obtained by 
chemistry in small molecules. However, even now, computational calculation of
such information with quantum chemistry also tends to be difficult, especially
for polynuclear metalloproteins. Here we report a charge-density analysis of the 
high-potential iron-sulfur protein from the thermophilic purple bacterium
Thermochromatium tepidum using X-ray data at an ultra-high resolution of 0.48 Å. 
Residual electron densities in the conventional refinement are assigned as
valence electrons in the multipolar refinement. Iron 3d and sulfur 3p electron
densities of the Fe4S4 cluster are visualized around the atoms. Such information 
provides the most detailed view of the valence electrons of the metal complex in 
the protein. The asymmetry of the iron-sulfur cluster and the protein environment
suggests the structural basis of charge storing on electron transfer. Our
charge-density analysis reveals many fine features around the metal complex for
the first time, and will enable further theoretical and experimental studies of
metalloproteins.

In order to survive, bacteria continually sense, and respond to, environmental
fluctuations. Stringent control represents a key bacterial stress response to
nutrient starvation that leads to rapid and comprehensive reprogramming of
metabolic and transcriptional patterns. In general, transcription of genes for
growth and proliferation is downregulated, while those important for survival and
virulence are upregulated. Amino acid starvation is sensed by depletion of the
aminoacylated tRNA pools, and this results in accumulation of ribosomes stalled
with non-aminoacylated (uncharged) tRNA in the ribosomal A site. RelA is
recruited to stalled ribosomes and activated to synthesize a hyperphosphorylated 
guanosine analogue, (p)ppGpp, which acts as a pleiotropic secondary messenger.
However, structural information about how RelA recognizes stalled ribosomes and
discriminates against aminoacylated tRNAs is missing. Here we present the
cryo-electron microscopy structure of RelA bound to the bacterial ribosome
stalled with uncharged tRNA. The structure reveals that RelA utilizes a distinct 
binding site compared to the translational factors, with a multi-domain
architecture that wraps around a highly distorted A-site tRNA. The TGS (ThrRS,
GTPase and SpoT) domain of RelA binds the CCA tail to orient the free 3' hydroxyl
group of the terminal adenosine towards a β-strand, such that an aminoacylated
tRNA at this position would be sterically precluded. The structure supports a
model in which association of RelA with the ribosome suppresses auto-inhibition
to activate synthesis of (p)ppGpp and initiate the stringent response. Since
stringent control is responsible for the survival of pathogenic bacteria under
stress conditions, and contributes to chronic infections and antibiotic
tolerance, RelA represents a good target for the development of novel
antibacterial therapeutics.

Precision medicines exert selective pressure on tumour cells that leads to the
preferential growth of resistant subpopulations, necessitating the development of
next-generation therapies to treat the evolving cancer. The PIK3CA-AKT-mTOR
pathway is one of the most commonly activated pathways in human cancers, which
has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target various nodes
in the pathway. Among these agents, first-generation mTOR inhibitors (rapalogs)
have caused responses in 'N-of-1' cases, and second-generation mTOR kinase
inhibitors (TORKi) are currently in clinical trials. Here we sought to delineate 
the likely resistance mechanisms to existing mTOR inhibitors in human cell lines,
as a guide for next-generation therapies. The mechanism of resistance to the
TORKi was unusual in that intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR was increased, rather
than a direct active-site mutation interfering with drug binding. Indeed,
identical drug-resistant mutations have been also identified in drug-naive
patients, suggesting that tumours with activating MTOR mutations will be
intrinsically resistant to second-generation mTOR inhibitors. We report the
development of a new class of mTOR inhibitors that overcomes resistance to
existing first- and second-generation inhibitors. The third-generation mTOR
inhibitor exploits the unique juxtaposition of two drug-binding pockets to create
a bivalent interaction that allows inhibition of these resistant mutants.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus (family
Flaviviridae) and was first described in 1947 in Uganda following blood analyses 
of sentinel Rhesus monkeys. Until the twentieth century, the African and Asian
lineages of the virus did not cause meaningful infections in humans. However, in 
2007, vectored by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, ZIKV caused the first noteworthy
epidemic on the Yap Island in Micronesia. Patients experienced fever, skin rash, 
arthralgia and conjunctivitis. From 2013 to 2015, the Asian lineage of the virus 
caused further massive outbreaks in New Caledonia and French Polynesia. In 2013, 
ZIKV reached Brazil, later spreading to other countries in South and Central
America. In Brazil, the virus has been linked to congenital malformations,
including microcephaly and other severe neurological diseases, such as
Guillain-Barré syndrome. Despite clinical evidence, direct experimental proof
showing that the Brazilian ZIKV (ZIKV(BR)) strain causes birth defects remains
absent. Here we demonstrate that ZIKV(BR) infects fetuses, causing intrauterine
growth restriction, including signs of microcephaly, in mice. Moreover, the virus
infects human cortical progenitor cells, leading to an increase in cell death. We
also report that the infection of human brain organoids results in a reduction of
proliferative zones and disrupted cortical layers. These results indicate that
ZIKV(BR) crosses the placenta and causes microcephaly by targeting cortical
progenitor cells, inducing cell death by apoptosis and autophagy, and impairing
neurodevelopment. Our data reinforce the growing body of evidence linking the
ZIKV(BR) outbreak to the alarming number of cases of congenital brain
malformations. Our model can be used to determine the efficiency of therapeutic
approaches to counteracting the harmful impact of ZIKV(BR) in human
neurodevelopment.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA), the major class of antibody secreted by the gut mucosa,
is an important contributor to gut barrier function. The repertoire of IgA bound 
to gut bacteria reflects both T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways, plus
glycans present on the antibody's secretory component. Human gut bacterial taxa
targeted by IgA in the setting of barrier dysfunction are capable of producing
intestinal pathology when isolated and transferred to gnotobiotic mice. A complex
reorientation of gut immunity occurs as infants transition from passively
acquired IgA present in breast milk to host-derived IgA. How IgA responses
co-develop with assembly of the microbiota during this period remains poorly
understood. Here, we (1) identify a set of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa
whose representations define a program of microbiota assembly and maturation
during the first 2 postnatal years that is shared across 40 healthy twin pairs in
the USA; (2) describe a pattern of progression of gut mucosal IgA responses to
bacterial members of the microbiota that is highly distinctive for family members
(twin pairs) during the first several postnatal months then generalizes across
pairs in the second year; and (3) assess the effects of zygosity, birth mode, and
breast feeding. Age-associated differences in these IgA responses can be
recapitulated in young germ-free mice, colonized with faecal microbiota obtained 
from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets 
that simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Most of
these responses were robust to diet, suggesting that 'intrinsic' properties of
community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses. The approach
described can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and
disease states and to help discover ways of repairing or preventing perturbations
in this facet of host immunity.

Human-associated microbial communities have a crucial role in determining our
health and well-being, and this has led to the continuing development of
microbiome-based therapies such as faecal microbiota transplantation. These
microbial communities are very complex, dynamic and highly personalized
ecosystems, exhibiting a high degree of inter-individual variability in both
species assemblages and abundance profiles. It is not known whether the
underlying ecological dynamics of these communities, which can be parameterized
by growth rates, and intra- and inter-species interactions in population dynamics
models, are largely host-independent (that is, universal) or host-specific. If
the inter-individual variability reflects host-specific dynamics due to
differences in host lifestyle, physiology or genetics, then generic microbiome
manipulations may have unintended consequences, rendering them ineffective or
even detrimental. Alternatively, microbial ecosystems of different subjects may
exhibit universal dynamics, with the inter-individual variability mainly
originating from differences in the sets of colonizing species. Here we develop a
new computational method to characterize human microbial dynamics. By applying
this method to cross-sectional data from two large-scale metagenomic studies--the
Human Microbiome Project and the Student Microbiome Project--we show that gut and
mouth microbiomes display pronounced universal dynamics, whereas communities
associated with certain skin sites are probably shaped by differences in the host
environment. Notably, the universality of gut microbial dynamics is not observed 
in subjects with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection but is observed in the
same set of subjects after faecal microbiota transplantation. These results
fundamentally improve our understanding of the processes that shape human
microbial ecosystems, and pave the way to designing general microbiome-based
therapies.

Breviatea form a lineage of free living, unicellular protists, distantly related 
to animals and fungi. This lineage emerged almost one billion years ago, when the
oceanic oxygen content was low, and extant Breviatea have evolved or retained an 
anaerobic lifestyle. Here we report the cultivation of Lenisia limosa, gen. et
sp. nov., a newly discovered breviate colonized by relatives of animal-associated
Arcobacter. Physiological experiments show that the association of L. limosa with
Arcobacter is driven by the transfer of hydrogen and is mutualistic, providing
benefits to both partners. With whole-genome sequencing and differential
proteomics, we show that an experimentally observed fitness gain of L. limosa
could be explained by the activity of a so far unknown type of NAD(P)H-accepting 
hydrogenase, which is expressed in the presence, but not in the absence, of
Arcobacter. Differential proteomics further reveal that the presence of Lenisia
stimulates expression of known 'virulence' factors by Arcobacter. These proteins 
typically enable colonization of animal cells during infection, but may in the
present case act for mutual benefit. Finally, re-investigation of two currently
available transcriptomic data sets of other Breviatea reveals the presence and
activity of related hydrogen-consuming Arcobacter, indicating that mutualistic
interaction between these two groups of microbes might be pervasive. Our results 
support the notion that molecular mechanisms involved in virulence can also
support mutualism, as shown here for Arcobacter and Breviatea.

Recent excavations at the early Middle Pleistocene site of Mata Menge in the So'a
Basin of central Flores, Indonesia, have yielded hominin fossils attributed to a 
population ancestral to Late Pleistocene Homo floresiensis. Here we describe the 
age and context of the Mata Menge hominin specimens and associated archaeological
findings. The fluvial sandstone layer from which the in situ fossils were
excavated in 2014 was deposited in a small valley stream around 700 thousand
years ago, as indicated by (40)Ar/(39)Ar and fission track dates on
stratigraphically bracketing volcanic ash and pyroclastic density current
deposits, in combination with coupled uranium-series and electron spin resonance 
dating of fossil teeth. Palaeoenvironmental data indicate a relatively dry
climate in the So'a Basin during the early Middle Pleistocene, while various
lines of evidence suggest the hominins inhabited a savannah-like open grassland
habitat with a wetland component. The hominin fossils occur alongside the remains
of an insular fauna and a simple stone technology that is markedly similar to
that associated with Late Pleistocene H. floresiensis.

The evolutionary origin of Homo floresiensis, a diminutive hominin species
previously known only by skeletal remains from Liang Bua in western Flores,
Indonesia, has been intensively debated. It is a matter of controversy whether
this primitive form, dated to the Late Pleistocene, evolved from early Asian Homo
erectus and represents a unique and striking case of evolutionary reversal in
hominin body and brain size within an insular environment. The alternative
hypothesis is that H. floresiensis derived from an older, smaller-brained member 
of our genus, such as Homo habilis, or perhaps even late Australopithecus,
signalling a hitherto undocumented dispersal of hominins from Africa into eastern
Asia by two million years ago (2 Ma). Here we describe hominin fossils excavated 
in 2014 from an early Middle Pleistocene site (Mata Menge) in the So'a Basin of
central Flores. These specimens comprise a mandible fragment and six isolated
teeth belonging to at least three small-jawed and small-toothed individuals.
Dating to ~0.7 Ma, these fossils now constitute the oldest hominin remains from
Flores. The Mata Menge mandible and teeth are similar in dimensions and
morphological characteristics to those of H. floresiensis from Liang Bua. The
exception is the mandibular first molar, which retains a more primitive
condition. Notably, the Mata Menge mandible and molar are even smaller in size
than those of the two existing H. floresiensis individuals from Liang Bua. The
Mata Menge fossils are derived compared with Australopithecus and H. habilis, and
so tend to support the view that H. floresiensis is a dwarfed descendent of early
Asian H. erectus. Our findings suggest that hominins on Flores had acquired
extremely small body size and other morphological traits specific to H.
floresiensis at an unexpectedly early time.

The distribution, accumulation and circulation of oxygen and hydrogen in Earth's 
interior dictate the geochemical evolution of the hydrosphere, atmosphere and
biosphere. The oxygen-rich atmosphere and iron-rich core represent two
end-members of the oxygen-iron (O-Fe) system, overlapping with the entire
pressure-temperature-composition range of the planet. The extreme pressure and
temperature conditions of the deep interior alter the oxidation states, spin
states and phase stabilities of iron oxides, creating new stoichiometries, such
as Fe4O5 (ref. 5) and Fe5O6 (ref. 6). Such interactions between O and Fe dictate 
Earth's formation, the separation of the core and mantle, and the evolution of
the atmosphere. Iron, in its multiple oxidation states, controls the oxygen
fugacity and oxygen budget, with hydrogen having a key role in the reaction of Fe
and O (causing iron to rust in humid air). Here we use first-principles
calculations and experiments to identify a highly stable, pyrite-structured iron 
oxide (FeO2) at 76 gigapascals and 1,800 kelvin that holds an excessive amount of
oxygen. We show that the mineral goethite, FeOOH, which exists ubiquitously as
'rust' and is concentrated in bog iron ore, decomposes under the deep
lower-mantle conditions to form FeO2 and release H2. The reaction could cause
accumulation of the heavy FeO2-bearing patches in the deep lower mantle, upward
migration of hydrogen, and separation of the oxygen and hydrogen cycles. This
process provides an alternative interpretation for the origin of seismic and
geochemical anomalies in the deep lower mantle, as well as a sporadic O2 source
for the Great Oxidation Event over two billion years ago that created the present
oxygen-rich atmosphere.

Molecular machines are among the most complex of all functional molecules and lie
at the heart of nearly every biological process. A number of synthetic
small-molecule machines have been developed, including molecular muscles,
synthesizers, pumps, walkers, transporters and light-driven and electrically
driven rotary motors. However, although biological molecular motors are powered
by chemical gradients or the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), so far
there are no synthetic small-molecule motors that can operate autonomously using 
chemical energy (that is, the components move with net directionality as long as 
a chemical fuel is present). Here we describe a system in which a small molecular
ring (macrocycle) is continuously transported directionally around a cyclic
molecular track when powered by irreversible reactions of a chemical fuel,
9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride. Key to the design is that the rate of
reaction of this fuel with reactive sites on the cyclic track is faster when the 
macrocycle is far from the reactive site than when it is near to it. We find that
a bulky pyridine-based catalyst promotes carbonate-forming reactions that ratchet
the displacement of the macrocycle away from the reactive sites on the track.
Under reaction conditions where both attachment and cleavage of the
9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl groups occur through different processes, and the
cleavage reaction occurs at a rate independent of macrocycle location, net
directional rotation of the molecular motor continues for as long as unreacted
fuel remains. We anticipate that autonomous chemically fuelled molecular motors
will find application as engines in molecular nanotechnology.

Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy with high
efficiencies and environmental benefits, as compared with traditional heat
engines. Yttria-stabilized zirconia is perhaps the material with the most
potential as an electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), owing to its
stability and near-unity ionic transference number. Although there exist
materials with superior ionic conductivity, they are often limited by their
ability to suppress electronic leakage when exposed to the reducing environment
at the fuel interface. Such electronic leakage reduces fuel cell power output and
the associated chemo-mechanical stresses can also lead to catastrophic fracture
of electrolyte membranes. Here we depart from traditional electrolyte design that
relies on cation substitution to sustain ionic conduction. Instead, we use a
perovskite nickelate as an electrolyte with high initial ionic and electronic
conductivity. Since many such oxides are also correlated electron systems, we can
suppress the electronic conduction through a filling-controlled Mott transition
induced by spontaneous hydrogen incorporation. Using such a nickelate as the
electrolyte in free-standing membrane geometry, we demonstrate a low-temperature 
micro-fabricated SOFC with high performance. The ionic conductivity of the
nickelate perovskite is comparable to the best-performing solid electrolytes in
the same temperature range, with a very low activation energy. The results
present a design strategy for high-performance materials exhibiting emergent
properties arising from strong electron correlations.

trade-off.

Metals have been mankind's most essential materials for thousands of years;
however, their use is affected by ecological and economical concerns. Alloys with
higher strength and ductility could alleviate some of these concerns by reducing 
weight and improving energy efficiency. However, most metallurgical mechanisms
for increasing strength lead to ductility loss, an effect referred to as the
strength-ductility trade-off. Here we present a metastability-engineering
strategy in which we design nanostructured, bulk high-entropy alloys with
multiple compositionally equivalent high-entropy phases. High-entropy alloys were
originally proposed to benefit from phase stabilization through entropy
maximization. Yet here, motivated by recent work that relaxes the strict
restrictions on high-entropy alloy compositions by demonstrating the weakness of 
this connection, the concept is overturned. We decrease phase stability to
achieve two key benefits: interface hardening due to a dual-phase microstructure 
(resulting from reduced thermal stability of the high-temperature phase); and
transformation-induced hardening (resulting from the reduced mechanical stability
of the room-temperature phase). This combines the best of two worlds: extensive
hardening due to the decreased phase stability known from advanced steels and
massive solid-solution strengthening of high-entropy alloys. In our
transformation-induced plasticity-assisted, dual-phase high-entropy alloy
(TRIP-DP-HEA), these two contributions lead respectively to enhanced trans-grain 
and inter-grain slip resistance, and hence, increased strength. Moreover, the
increased strain hardening capacity that is enabled by dislocation hardening of
the stable phase and transformation-induced hardening of the metastable phase
produces increased ductility. This combined increase in strength and ductility
distinguishes the TRIP-DP-HEA alloy from other recently developed structural
materials. This metastability-engineering strategy should thus usefully guide
design in the near-infinite compositional space of high-entropy alloys.

Quantum mechanics can help to solve complex problems in physics and chemistry,
provided they can be programmed in a physical device. In adiabatic quantum
computing, a system is slowly evolved from the ground state of a simple initial
Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian that encodes a computational problem. The
appeal of this approach lies in the combination of simplicity and generality; in 
principle, any problem can be encoded. In practice, applications are restricted
by limited connectivity, available interactions and noise. A complementary
approach is digital quantum computing, which enables the construction of
arbitrary interactions and is compatible with error correction, but uses quantum 
circuit algorithms that are problem-specific. Here we combine the advantages of
both approaches by implementing digitized adiabatic quantum computing in a
superconducting system. We tomographically probe the system during the digitized 
evolution and explore the scaling of errors with system size. We then let the
full system find the solution to random instances of the one-dimensional Ising
problem as well as problem Hamiltonians that involve more complex interactions.
This digital quantum simulation of the adiabatic algorithm consists of up to nine
qubits and up to 1,000 quantum logic gates. The demonstration of digitized
adiabatic quantum computing in the solid state opens a path to synthesizing
long-range correlations and solving complex computational problems. When combined
with fault-tolerance, our approach becomes a general-purpose algorithm that is
scalable.

Supermassive black holes in galaxy centres can grow by the accretion of gas,
liberating energy that might regulate star formation on galaxy-wide scales. The
nature of the gaseous fuel reservoirs that power black hole growth is
nevertheless largely unconstrained by observations, and is instead routinely
simplified as a smooth, spherical inflow of very hot gas. Recent theory and
simulations instead predict that accretion can be dominated by a stochastic,
clumpy distribution of very cold molecular clouds--a departure from the 'hot
mode' accretion model--although unambiguous observational support for this
prediction remains elusive. Here we report observations that reveal a cold,
clumpy accretion flow towards a supermassive black hole fuel reservoir in the
nucleus of the Abell 2597 Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), a nearby (redshift
z = 0.0821) giant elliptical galaxy surrounded by a dense halo of hot plasma.
Under the right conditions, thermal instabilities produce a rain of cold clouds
that fall towards the galaxy's centre, sustaining star formation amid a
kiloparsec-scale molecular nebula that is found at its core. The observations
show that these cold clouds also fuel black hole accretion, revealing 'shadows'
cast by the molecular clouds as they move inward at about 300 kilometres per
second towards the active supermassive black hole, which serves as a bright
backlight. Corroborating evidence from prior observations of warmer atomic gas at
extremely high spatial resolution, along with simple arguments based on geometry 
and probability, indicate that these clouds are within the innermost hundred
parsecs of the black hole, and falling closer towards it.

Obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome are associated with
changes to the gut microbiota; however, the mechanism by which modifications to
the gut microbiota might lead to these conditions is unknown. Here we show that
increased production of acetate by an altered gut microbiota in rodents leads to 
activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which, in turn, promotes
increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased ghrelin secretion,
hyperphagia, obesity and related sequelae. Together, these findings identify
increased acetate production resulting from a nutrient-gut microbiota interaction
and subsequent parasympathetic activation as possible therapeutic targets for
obesity.

Survival in threatening situations depends on the selection and rapid execution
of an appropriate active or passive defensive response, yet the underlying brain 
circuitry is not understood. Here we use circuit-based optogenetic, in vivo and
in vitro electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical tracing methods to define
midbrain periaqueductal grey circuits for specific defensive behaviours. We
identify an inhibitory pathway from the central nucleus of the amygdala to the
ventrolateral periaqueductal grey that produces freezing by disinhibition of
ventrolateral periaqueductal grey excitatory outputs to pre-motor targets in the 
magnocellular nucleus of the medulla. In addition, we provide evidence for
anatomical and functional interaction of this freezing pathway with long-range
and local circuits mediating flight. Our data define the neuronal circuitry
underlying the execution of freezing, an evolutionarily conserved defensive
behaviour, which is expressed by many species including fish, rodents and
primates. In humans, dysregulation of this 'survival circuit' has been implicated
in anxiety-related disorders.

Mammals are defined by their metagenome, a combination of host and microbiome
genes. This knowledge presents opportunities to further basic biology with
translation to human diseases. However, the now-documented influence of the
metagenome on experimental results and the reproducibility of in vivo mammalian
models present new challenges. Here we provide the scientific basis for calling
on all investigators, editors and funding agencies to embrace changes that will
enhance reproducible and interpretable experiments by accounting for metagenomic 
effects. Implementation of new reporting and experimental design principles will 
improve experimental work, speed discovery and translation, and properly use
substantial investments in biomedical research.

Modern humans arrived in Europe ~45,000 years ago, but little is known about
their genetic composition before the start of farming ~8,500 years ago. Here we
analyse genome-wide data from 51 Eurasians from ~45,000-7,000 years ago. Over
this time, the proportion of Neanderthal DNA decreased from 3-6% to around 2%,
consistent with natural selection against Neanderthal variants in modern humans. 
Whereas there is no evidence of the earliest modern humans in Europe contributing
to the genetic composition of present-day Europeans, all individuals between
~37,000 and ~14,000 years ago descended from a single founder population which
forms part of the ancestry of present-day Europeans. An ~35,000-year-old
individual from northwest Europe represents an early branch of this founder
population which was then displaced across a broad region, before reappearing in 
southwest Europe at the height of the last Ice Age ~19,000 years ago. During the 
major warming period after ~14,000 years ago, a genetic component related to
present-day Near Easterners became widespread in Europe. These results document
how population turnover and migration have been recurring themes of European
prehistory.

Ribosome biogenesis is a highly complex process in eukaryotes, involving
temporally and spatially regulated ribosomal protein (r-protein) binding and
ribosomal RNA remodelling events in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm and cytoplasm.
Hundreds of assembly factors, organized into sequential functional groups,
facilitate and guide the maturation process into productive assembly branches in 
and across different cellular compartments. However, the precise mechanisms by
which these assembly factors function are largely unknown. Here we use
cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the structures of yeast nucleoplasmic
pre-60S particles affinity-purified using the epitope-tagged assembly factor
Nog2. Our data pinpoint the locations and determine the structures of over 20
assembly factors, which are enriched in two areas: an arc region extending from
the central protuberance to the polypeptide tunnel exit, and the domain including
the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) that separates 5.8S and 25S ribosomal
RNAs. In particular, two regulatory GTPases, Nog2 and Nog1, act as hub proteins
to interact with multiple, distant assembly factors and functional ribosomal RNA 
elements, manifesting their critical roles in structural remodelling checkpoints 
and nuclear export. Moreover, our snapshots of compositionally and structurally
different pre-60S intermediates provide essential mechanistic details for three
major remodelling events before nuclear export: rotation of the 5S
ribonucleoprotein, construction of the active centre and ITS2 removal. The rich
structural information in our structures provides a framework to dissect
molecular roles of diverse assembly factors in eukaryotic ribosome assembly.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib are approved treatments for non-small
cell lung cancers harbouring activating mutations in the EGFR kinase, but
resistance arises rapidly, most frequently owing to the secondary T790M mutation 
within the ATP site of the receptor. Recently developed mutant-selective
irreversible inhibitors are highly active against the T790M mutant, but their
efficacy can be compromised by acquired mutation of C797, the cysteine residue
with which they form a key covalent bond. All current EGFR TKIs target the
ATP-site of the kinase, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with
alternative mechanisms of action. Here we describe the rational discovery of
EAI045, an allosteric inhibitor that targets selected drug-resistant EGFR mutants
but spares the wild-type receptor. The crystal structure shows that the compound 
binds an allosteric site created by the displacement of the regulatory C-helix in
an inactive conformation of the kinase. The compound inhibits L858R/T790M-mutant 
EGFR with low-nanomolar potency in biochemical assays. However, as a single agent
it is not effective in blocking EGFR-driven proliferation in cells owing to
differential potency on the two subunits of the dimeric receptor, which interact 
in an asymmetric manner in the active state. We observe marked synergy of EAI045 
with cetuximab, an antibody therapeutic that blocks EGFR dimerization, rendering 
the kinase uniformly susceptible to the allosteric agent. EAI045 in combination
with cetuximab is effective in mouse models of lung cancer driven by
EGFR(L858R/T790M) and by EGFR(L858R/T790M/C797S), a mutant that is resistant to
all currently available EGFR TKIs. More generally, our findings illustrate the
utility of purposefully targeting allosteric sites to obtain mutant-selective
inhibitors.

Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcriptional regulators of cellular and systemic 
cholesterol homeostasis. Under conditions of excess cholesterol, LXR activation
induces the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux,
facilitates cholesterol esterification by promoting fatty acid synthesis, and
inhibits cholesterol uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor. The fact
that sterol content is maintained in a narrow range in most cell types and in the
organism as a whole suggests that extensive crosstalk between regulatory pathways
must exist. However, the molecular mechanisms that integrate LXRs with other
lipid metabolic pathways are incompletely understood. Here we show that ligand
activation of LXRs in mouse liver not only promotes cholesterol efflux, but also 
simultaneously inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. We further identify the long
non-coding RNA LeXis as a mediator of this effect. Hepatic LeXis expression is
robustly induced in response to a Western diet (high in fat and cholesterol) or
to pharmacological LXR activation. Raising or lowering LeXis levels in the liver 
affects the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and alters
the cholesterol levels in the liver and plasma. LeXis interacts with and affects 
the DNA interactions of RALY, a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein that acts as a
transcriptional cofactor for cholesterol biosynthetic genes in the mouse liver.
These findings outline a regulatory role for a non-coding RNA in lipid metabolism
and advance our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate sterol
homeostasis.

Myocardial infarction results in compromised myocardial function and heart
failure owing to insufficient cardiomyocyte self-renewal. Unlike many
vertebrates, mammalian hearts have only a transient neonatal renewal capacity.
Reactivating primitive reparative ability in the mature mammalian heart requires 
knowledge of the mechanisms that promote early heart repair. By testing an
established Hippo-deficient heart regeneration mouse model for factors that
promote renewal, here we show that the expression of Pitx2 is induced in injured,
Hippo-deficient ventricles. Pitx2-deficient neonatal mouse hearts failed to
repair after apex resection, whereas adult mouse cardiomyocytes with Pitx2
gain-of-function efficiently regenerated after myocardial infarction. Genomic
analyses indicated that Pitx2 activated genes encoding electron transport chain
components and reactive oxygen species scavengers. A subset of Pitx2 target genes
was cooperatively regulated with the Hippo pathway effector Yap. Furthermore,
Nrf2, a regulator of the antioxidant response, directly regulated the expression 
and subcellular localization of Pitx2. Pitx2 mutant myocardium had increased
levels of reactive oxygen species, while antioxidant supplementation suppressed
the Pitx2 loss-of-function phenotype. These findings reveal a genetic pathway
activated by tissue damage that is essential for cardiac repair.

Recent studies suggest that a shared neural ensemble may link distinct memories
encoded close in time. According to the memory allocation hypothesis, learning
triggers a temporary increase in neuronal excitability that biases the
representation of a subsequent memory to the neuronal ensemble encoding the first
memory, such that recall of one memory increases the likelihood of recalling the 
other memory. Here we show in mice that the overlap between the hippocampal CA1
ensembles activated by two distinct contexts acquired within a day is higher than
when they are separated by a week. Several findings indicate that this overlap of
neuronal ensembles links two contextual memories. First, fear paired with one
context is transferred to a neutral context when the two contexts are acquired
within a day but not across a week. Second, the first memory strengthens the
second memory within a day but not across a week. Older mice, known to have lower
CA1 excitability, do not show the overlap between ensembles, the transfer of fear
between contexts, or the strengthening of the second memory. Finally, in aged
mice, increasing cellular excitability and activating a common ensemble of CA1
neurons during two distinct context exposures rescued the deficit in linking
memories. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that contextual memories
encoded close in time are linked by directing storage into overlapping ensembles.
Alteration of these processes by ageing could affect the temporal structure of
memories, thus impairing efficient recall of related information.

Very little is known about Neanderthal cultures, particularly early ones. Other
than lithic implements and exceptional bone tools, very few artefacts have been
preserved. While those that do remain include red and black pigments and burial
sites, these indications of modernity are extremely sparse and few have been
precisely dated, thus greatly limiting our knowledge of these predecessors of
modern humans. Here we report the dating of annular constructions made of broken 
stalagmites found deep in Bruniquel Cave in southwest France. The regular
geometry of the stalagmite circles, the arrangement of broken stalagmites and
several traces of fire demonstrate the anthropogenic origin of these
constructions. Uranium-series dating of stalagmite regrowths on the structures
and on burnt bone, combined with the dating of stalagmite tips in the structures,
give a reliable and replicated age of 176.5 thousand years (±2.1 thousand years),
making these edifices among the oldest known well-dated constructions made by
humans. Their presence at 336 metres from the entrance of the cave indicates that
humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment, which
can be considered a major step in human modernity.

The wing patterns of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are diverse and striking
examples of evolutionary diversification by natural selection. Lepidopteran wing 
colour patterns are a key innovation, consisting of arrays of coloured scales. We
still lack a general understanding of how these patterns are controlled and
whether this control shows any commonality across the 160,000 moth and 17,000
butterfly species. Here, we use fine-scale mapping with population genomics and
gene expression analyses to identify a gene, cortex, that regulates pattern
switches in multiple species across the mimetic radiation in Heliconius
butterflies. cortex belongs to a fast-evolving subfamily of the otherwise highly 
conserved fizzy family of cell-cycle regulators, suggesting that it probably
regulates pigmentation patterning by regulating scale cell development. In
parallel with findings in the peppered moth (Biston betularia), our results
suggest that this mechanism is common within Lepidoptera and that cortex has
become a major target for natural selection acting on colour and pattern
variation in this group of insects.

Discovering the mutational events that fuel adaptation to environmental change
remains an important challenge for evolutionary biology. The classroom example of
a visible evolutionary response is industrial melanism in the peppered moth
(Biston betularia): the replacement, during the Industrial Revolution, of the
common pale typica form by a previously unknown black (carbonaria) form, driven
by the interaction between bird predation and coal pollution. The carbonaria
locus has been coarsely localized to a 200-kilobase region, but the specific
identity and nature of the sequence difference controlling the carbonaria-typica 
polymorphism, and the gene it influences, are unknown. Here we show that the
mutation event giving rise to industrial melanism in Britain was the insertion of
a large, tandemly repeated, transposable element into the first intron of the
gene cortex. Statistical inference based on the distribution of recombined
carbonaria haplotypes indicates that this transposition event occurred around
1819, consistent with the historical record. We have begun to dissect the mode of
action of the carbonaria transposable element by showing that it increases the
abundance of a cortex transcript, the protein product of which plays an important
role in cell-cycle regulation, during early wing disc development. Our findings
fill a substantial knowledge gap in the iconic example of microevolutionary
change, adding a further layer of insight into the mechanism of adaptation in
response to natural selection. The discovery that the mutation itself is a
transposable element will stimulate further debate about the importance of
'jumping genes' as a source of major phenotypic novelty.

The conduction of heat through minerals and melts at extreme pressures and
temperatures is of central importance to the evolution and dynamics of planets.
In the cooling Earth's core, the thermal conductivity of iron alloys defines the 
adiabatic heat flux and therefore the thermal and compositional energy available 
to support the production of Earth's magnetic field via dynamo action. Attempts
to describe thermal transport in Earth's core have been problematic, with
predictions of high thermal conductivity at odds with traditional geophysical
models and direct evidence for a primordial magnetic field in the rock record.
Measurements of core heat transport are needed to resolve this difference. Here
we present direct measurements of the thermal conductivity of solid iron at
pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the cores of Mercury-sized to
Earth-sized planets, using a dynamically laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. Our
measurements place the thermal conductivity of Earth's core near the low end of
previous estimates, at 18-44 watts per metre per kelvin. The result is in
agreement with palaeomagnetic measurements indicating that Earth's geodynamo has 
persisted since the beginning of Earth's history, and allows for a solid inner
core as old as the dynamo.

Earth continuously generates a dipole magnetic field in its convecting liquid
outer core by a self-sustained dynamo action. Metallic iron is a dominant
component of the outer core, so its electrical and thermal conductivity controls 
the dynamics and thermal evolution of Earth's core. However, in spite of
extensive research, the transport properties of iron under core conditions are
still controversial. Since free electrons are a primary carrier of both electric 
current and heat, the electron scattering mechanism in iron under high pressure
and temperature holds the key to understanding the transport properties of
planetary cores. Here we measure the electrical resistivity (the reciprocal of
electrical conductivity) of iron at the high temperatures (up to 4,500 kelvin)
and pressures (megabars) of Earth's core in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell.
The value measured for the resistivity of iron is even lower than the value
extrapolated from high-pressure, low-temperature data using the Bloch-Grüneisen
law, which considers only the electron-phonon scattering. This shows that the
iron resistivity is strongly suppressed by the resistivity saturation effect at
high temperatures. The low electrical resistivity of iron indicates the high
thermal conductivity of Earth's core, suggesting rapid core cooling and a young
inner core less than 0.7 billion years old. Therefore, an abrupt increase in
palaeomagnetic field intensity around 1.3 billion years ago may not be related to
the birth of the inner core.

Worldwide heavy oil and bitumen deposits amount to 9 trillion barrels of oil
distributed in over 280 basins around the world, with Canada home to oil sands
deposits of 1.7 trillion barrels. The global development of this resource and the
increase in oil production from oil sands has caused environmental concerns over 
the presence of toxic compounds in nearby ecosystems and acid deposition. The
contribution of oil sands exploration to secondary organic aerosol formation, an 
important component of atmospheric particulate matter that affects air quality
and climate, remains poorly understood. Here we use data from airborne
measurements over the Canadian oil sands, laboratory experiments and a box-model 
study to provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of secondary organic 
aerosol production from oil sands emissions. We find that the evaporation and
atmospheric oxidation of low-volatility organic vapours from the mined oil sands 
material is directly responsible for the majority of the observed secondary
organic aerosol mass. The resultant production rates of 45-84 tonnes per day make
the oil sands one of the largest sources of anthropogenic secondary organic
aerosols in North America. Heavy oil and bitumen account for over ten per cent of
global oil production today, and this figure continues to grow. Our findings
suggest that the production of the more viscous crude oils could be a large
source of secondary organic aerosols in many production and refining regions
worldwide, and that such production should be considered when assessing the
environmental impacts of current and planned bitumen and heavy oil extraction
projects globally.

Electric-field-induced charge separation (polarization) is the most fundamental
manifestation of the interaction of light with matter and a phenomenon of great
technological relevance. Nonlinear optical polarization produces coherent
radiation in spectral ranges inaccessible by lasers and constitutes the key to
ultimate-speed signal manipulation. Terahertz techniques have provided
experimental access to this important observable up to frequencies of several
terahertz. Here we demonstrate that attosecond metrology extends the resolution
to petahertz frequencies of visible light. Attosecond polarization spectroscopy
allows measurement of the response of the electronic system of silica to strong
(more than one volt per ångström) few-cycle optical (about 750 nanometres)
fields. Our proof-of-concept study provides time-resolved insight into the
attosecond nonlinear polarization and the light-matter energy transfer dynamics
behind the optical Kerr effect and multi-photon absorption. Timing the nonlinear 
polarization relative to the driving laser electric field with sub-30-attosecond 
accuracy yields direct quantitative access to both the reversible and
irreversible energy exchange between visible-infrared light and electrons.
Quantitative determination of dissipation within a signal manipulation cycle of
only a few femtoseconds duration (by measurement and ab initio calculation)
reveals the feasibility of dielectric optical switching at clock rates above 100 
terahertz. The observed sub-femtosecond rise of energy transfer from the field to
the material (for a peak electric field strength exceeding 2.5 volts per
ångström) in turn indicates the viability of petahertz-bandwidth metrology with a
solid-state device.

The vast, deep, volatile-ice-filled basin informally named Sputnik Planum is
central to Pluto's vigorous geological activity. Composed of molecular nitrogen, 
methane, and carbon monoxide ices, but dominated by nitrogen ice, this layer is
organized into cells or polygons, typically about 10 to 40 kilometres across,
that resemble the surface manifestation of solid-state convection. Here we
report, on the basis of available rheological measurements, that solid layers of 
nitrogen ice with a thickness in excess of about one kilometre should undergo
convection for estimated present-day heat-flow conditions on Pluto. More
importantly, we show numerically that convective overturn in a
several-kilometre-thick layer of solid nitrogen can explain the great lateral
width of the cells. The temperature dependence of nitrogen-ice viscosity implies 
that the ice layer convects in the so-called sluggish lid regime, a unique
convective mode not previously definitively observed in the Solar System. Average
surface horizontal velocities of a few centimetres a year imply surface transport
or renewal times of about 500,000 years, well under the ten-million-year
upper-limit crater retention age for Sputnik Planum. Similar convective surface
renewal may also occur on other dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt, which may help 
to explain the high albedos shown by some of these bodies.

Pluto's surface is surprisingly young and geologically active. One of its
youngest terrains is the near-equatorial region informally named Sputnik Planum, 
which is a topographic basin filled by nitrogen (N2) ice mixed with minor amounts
of CH4 and CO ices. Nearly the entire surface of the region is divided into
irregular polygons about 20-30 kilometres in diameter, whose centres rise tens of
metres above their sides. The edges of this region exhibit bulk flow features
without polygons. Both thermal contraction and convection have been proposed to
explain this terrain, but polygons formed from thermal contraction (analogous to 
ice-wedges or mud-crack networks) of N2 are inconsistent with the observations on
Pluto of non-brittle deformation within the N2-ice sheet. Here we report a
parameterized convection model to compute the Rayleigh number of the N2 ice and
show that it is vigorously convecting, making Rayleigh-Bénard convection the most
likely explanation for these polygons. The diameter of Sputnik Planum's polygons 
and the dimensions of the 'floating mountains' (the hills of of water ice along
the edges of the polygons) suggest that its N2 ice is about ten kilometres thick.
The estimated convection velocity of 1.5 centimetres a year indicates a surface
age of only around a million years.

Accretion of matter onto black holes is universally associated with strong
radiative feedback and powerful outflows. In particular, black-hole transients
have outflows whose properties are strongly coupled to those of the accretion
flow. This includes X-ray winds of ionized material, expelled from the accretion 
disk encircling the black hole, and collimated radio jets. Very recently, a
distinct optical variability pattern has been reported in the transient
stellar-mass black hole V404 Cygni, and interpreted as disrupted mass flow into
the inner regions of its large accretion disk. Here we report observations of a
sustained outer accretion disk wind in V404 Cyg, which is unlike any seen
hitherto. We find that the outflowing wind is neutral, has a large covering
factor, expands at one per cent of the speed of light and triggers a nebular
phase once accretion drops sharply and the ejecta become optically thin. The
large expelled mass (>10(-8) solar masses) indicates that the outburst was
prematurely ended when a sizeable fraction of the outer disk was depleted by the 
wind, detaching the inner regions from the rest of the disk. The luminous, but
brief, accretion phases shown by transients with large accretion disks imply that
this outflow is probably a fundamental ingredient in regulating mass accretion
onto black holes.

During photosynthesis, the plant photosystem II core complex receives excitation 
energy from the peripheral light-harvesting complex II (LHCII). The pathways
along which excitation energy is transferred between them, and their assembly
mechanisms, remain to be deciphered through high-resolution structural studies.
Here we report the structure of a 1.1-megadalton spinach photosystem II-LHCII
supercomplex solved at 3.2 Å resolution through single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy. The structure reveals a homodimeric supramolecular system in which
each monomer contains 25 protein subunits, 105 chlorophylls, 28 carotenoids and
other cofactors. Three extrinsic subunits (PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ), which are
essential for optimal oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II, form a
triangular crown that shields the Mn4CaO5-binding domains of CP43 and D1. One
major trimeric and two minor monomeric LHCIIs associate with each core-complex
monomer, and the antenna-core interactions are reinforced by three small
intrinsic subunits (PsbW, PsbH and PsbZ). By analysing the closely connected
interfacial chlorophylls, we have obtained detailed insights into the
energy-transfer pathways between the antenna and core complexes.

Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the
effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly
understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and
phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which
77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the
somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the
5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q
trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular
Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine
kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in
addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the
phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not
readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other
amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including
CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of 
breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations,
narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and
amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.

We analysed whole-genome sequences of 560 breast cancers to advance understanding
of the driver mutations conferring clonal advantage and the mutational processes 
generating somatic mutations. We found that 93 protein-coding cancer genes
carried probable driver mutations. Some non-coding regions exhibited high
mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably
causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational
signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base
substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures,
characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with
defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1
function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third 
is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons,
introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and
mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of
the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.

The physiology of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is fundamental to brain
development and function. NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that 
function as heterotetramers composed mainly of GluN1 and GluN2 subunits.
Activation of NMDA receptors requires binding of neurotransmitter agonists to a
ligand-binding domain (LBD) and structural rearrangement of an amino-terminal
domain (ATD). Recent crystal structures of GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptors bound to
agonists and an allosteric inhibitor, ifenprodil, represent the allosterically
inhibited state. However, how the ATD and LBD move to activate the NMDA receptor 
ion channel remains unclear. Here we applied X-ray crystallography,
single-particle electron cryomicroscopy and electrophysiology to rat NMDA
receptors to show that, in the absence of ifenprodil, the bi-lobed structure of
GluN2 ATD adopts an open conformation accompanied by rearrangement of the
GluN1-GluN2 ATD heterodimeric interface, altering subunit orientation in the ATD 
and LBD and forming an active receptor conformation that gates the ion channel.

Circulating antibodies can access most tissues to mediate surveillance and
elimination of invading pathogens. Immunoprivileged tissues such as the brain and
the peripheral nervous system are shielded from plasma proteins by the
blood-brain barrier and blood-nerve barrier, respectively. Yet, circulating
antibodies must somehow gain access to these tissues to mediate their
antimicrobial functions. Here we examine the mechanism by which antibodies gain
access to neuronal tissues to control infection. Using a mouse model of genital
herpes infection, we demonstrate that both antibodies and CD4 T cells are
required to protect the host after immunization at a distal site. We show that
memory CD4 T cells migrate to the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord in response
to infection with herpes simplex virus type 2. Once inside these neuronal
tissues, CD4 T cells secrete interferon-γ and mediate local increase in vascular 
permeability, enabling antibody access for viral control. A similar requirement
for CD4 T cells for antibody access to the brain is observed after intranasal
challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus. Our results reveal a previously
unappreciated role of CD4 T cells in mobilizing antibodies to the peripheral
sites of infection where they help to limit viral spread.

Abiraterone blocks androgen synthesis and prolongs survival in patients with
castration-resistant prostate cancer, which is otherwise driven by intratumoral
androgen synthesis. Abiraterone is metabolized in patients to Δ(4)-abiraterone
(D4A), which has even greater anti-tumour activity and is structurally similar to
endogenous steroidal 5α-reductase substrates, such as testosterone. Here, we show
that D4A is converted to at least three 5α-reduced and three 5β-reduced
metabolites in human serum. The initial 5α-reduced metabolite,
3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is present at higher concentrations than D4A in patients
with prostate cancer taking abiraterone, and is an androgen receptor agonist,
which promotes prostate cancer progression. In a clinical trial of abiraterone
alone, followed by abiraterone plus dutasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor),
3-keto-5α-abiraterone and downstream metabolites were depleted by the addition of
dutasteride, while D4A concentrations rose, showing that dutasteride effectively 
blocks production of a tumour-promoting metabolite and permits D4A accumulation. 
Furthermore, dutasteride did not deplete the three 5β-reduced metabolites, which 
were also clinically detectable, demonstrating the specific biochemical effects
of pharmacological 5α-reductase inhibition on abiraterone metabolism. Our
findings suggest a previously unappreciated and biochemically specific method of 
clinically fine-tuning abiraterone metabolism to optimize therapy.

Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental
factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20% of the
variation across individuals. Here we report the results of a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier
discovery sample of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication
study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We
identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of
schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational 
attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene
expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in
neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological
pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for 
a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered
GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically 
relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of
individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to
characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition
and neuropsychiatric diseases.

Post-copulatory sexual selection (PSS), fuelled by female promiscuity, is
credited with the rapid evolution of sperm quality traits across diverse taxa.
Yet, our understanding of the adaptive significance of sperm ornaments and the
cryptic female preferences driving their evolution is extremely limited. Here we 
review the evolutionary allometry of exaggerated sexual traits (for example,
antlers, horns, tail feathers, mandibles and dewlaps), show that the giant sperm 
of some Drosophila species are possibly the most extreme ornaments in all of
nature and demonstrate how their existence challenges theories explaining the
intensity of sexual selection, mating-system evolution and the fundamental nature
of sex differences. We also combine quantitative genetic analyses of interacting 
sex-specific traits in D. melanogaster with comparative analyses of the condition
dependence of male and female reproductive potential across species with varying 
ornament size to reveal complex dynamics that may underlie sperm-length
evolution. Our results suggest that producing few gigantic sperm evolved by (1)
Fisherian runaway selection mediated by genetic correlations between sperm
length, the female preference for long sperm and female mating frequency, and (2)
longer sperm increasing the indirect benefits to females. Our results also
suggest that the developmental integration of sperm quality and quantity renders 
post-copulatory sexual selection on ejaculates unlikely to treat male-male
competition and female choice as discrete processes.

In many animal societies where hierarchies govern access to reproduction, the
social rank of individuals is related to their age and weight and slow-growing
animals may lose their place in breeding queues to younger 'challengers' that
grow faster. The threat of being displaced might be expected to favour the
evolution of competitive growth strategies, where individuals increase their own 
rate of growth in response to increases in the growth of potential rivals.
Although growth rates have been shown to vary in relation to changes in the
social environment in several vertebrates including fish and mammals, it is not
yet known whether individuals increase their growth rates in response to
increases in the growth of particular reproductive rivals. Here we show that, in 
wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), subordinates of both sexes respond
to experimentally induced increases in the growth of same-sex rivals by raising
their own growth rate and food intake. In addition, when individuals acquire
dominant status, they show a secondary period of accelerated growth whose
magnitude increases if the difference between their own weight and that of the
heaviest subordinate of the same sex in their group is small. Our results show
that individuals adjust their growth to the size of their closest competitor and 
raise the possibility that similar plastic responses to the risk of competition
may occur in other social mammals, including domestic animals and primates.

About half of present-day cloud condensation nuclei originate from atmospheric
nucleation, frequently appearing as a burst of new particles near midday.
Atmospheric observations show that the growth rate of new particles often
accelerates when the diameter of the particles is between one and ten nanometres.
In this critical size range, new particles are most likely to be lost by
coagulation with pre-existing particles, thereby failing to form new cloud
condensation nuclei that are typically 50 to 100 nanometres across. Sulfuric acid
vapour is often involved in nucleation but is too scarce to explain most
subsequent growth, leaving organic vapours as the most plausible alternative, at 
least in the planetary boundary layer. Although recent studies predict that
low-volatility organic vapours contribute during initial growth, direct evidence 
has been lacking. The accelerating growth may result from increased photolytic
production of condensable organic species in the afternoon, and the presence of a
possible Kelvin (curvature) effect, which inhibits organic vapour condensation on
the smallest particles (the nano-Köhler theory), has so far remained ambiguous.
Here we present experiments performed in a large chamber under atmospheric
conditions that investigate the role of organic vapours in the initial growth of 
nucleated organic particles in the absence of inorganic acids and bases such as
sulfuric acid or ammonia and amines, respectively. Using data from the same set
of experiments, it has been shown that organic vapours alone can drive
nucleation. We focus on the growth of nucleated particles and find that the
organic vapours that drive initial growth have extremely low volatilities
(saturation concentration less than 10(-4.5) micrograms per cubic metre). As the 
particles increase in size and the Kelvin barrier falls, subsequent growth is
primarily due to more abundant organic vapours of slightly higher volatility
(saturation concentrations of 10(-4.5) to 10(-0.5) micrograms per cubic metre).
We present a particle growth model that quantitatively reproduces our
measurements. Furthermore, we implement a parameterization of the first steps of 
growth in a global aerosol model and find that concentrations of atmospheric
cloud concentration nuclei can change substantially in response, that is, by up
to 50 per cent in comparison with previously assumed growth rate
parameterizations.

Atmospheric aerosols and their effect on clouds are thought to be important for
anthropogenic radiative forcing of the climate, yet remain poorly understood.
Globally, around half of cloud condensation nuclei originate from nucleation of
atmospheric vapours. It is thought that sulfuric acid is essential to initiate
most particle formation in the atmosphere, and that ions have a relatively minor 
role. Some laboratory studies, however, have reported organic particle formation 
without the intentional addition of sulfuric acid, although contamination could
not be excluded. Here we present evidence for the formation of aerosol particles 
from highly oxidized biogenic vapours in the absence of sulfuric acid in a large 
chamber under atmospheric conditions. The highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) are 
produced by ozonolysis of α-pinene. We find that ions from Galactic cosmic rays
increase the nucleation rate by one to two orders of magnitude compared with
neutral nucleation. Our experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical
calculations of the cluster binding energies of representative HOMs. Ion-induced 
nucleation of pure organic particles constitutes a potentially widespread source 
of aerosol particles in terrestrial environments with low sulfuric acid
pollution.

Topological insulators are insulating materials that display conducting surface
states protected by time-reversal symmetry, wherein electron spins are locked to 
their momentum. This unique property opens up new opportunities for creating
next-generation electronic, spintronic and quantum computation devices.
Introducing ferromagnetic order into a topological insulator system without
compromising its distinctive quantum coherent features could lead to the
realization of several predicted physical phenomena. In particular, achieving
robust long-range magnetic order at the surface of the topological insulator at
specific locations without introducing spin-scattering centres could open up new 
possibilities for devices. Here we use spin-polarized neutron reflectivity
experiments to demonstrate topologically enhanced interface magnetism by coupling
a ferromagnetic insulator (EuS) to a topological insulator (Bi2Se3) in a bilayer 
system. This interfacial ferromagnetism persists up to room temperature, even
though the ferromagnetic insulator is known to order ferromagnetically only at
low temperatures (<17 K). The magnetism induced at the interface resulting from
the large spin-orbit interaction and the spin-momentum locking of the topological
insulator surface greatly enhances the magnetic ordering (Curie) temperature of
this bilayer system. The ferromagnetism extends ~2 nm into the Bi2Se3 from the
interface. Owing to the short-range nature of the ferromagnetic exchange
interaction, the time-reversal symmetry is broken only near the surface of a
topological insulator, while leaving its bulk states unaffected. The topological 
magneto-electric response originating in such an engineered topological insulator
could allow efficient manipulation of the magnetization dynamics by an electric
field, providing an energy-efficient topological control mechanism for future
spin-based technologies.

Surveys have revealed many multi-planet systems containing super-Earths and
Neptunes in orbits of a few days to a few months. There is debate whether in situ
assembly or inward migration is the dominant mechanism of the formation of such
planetary systems. Simulations suggest that migration creates tightly packed
systems with planets whose orbital periods may be expressed as ratios of small
integers (resonances), often in a many-planet series (chain). In the hundreds of 
multi-planet systems of sub-Neptunes, more planet pairs are observed near
resonances than would generally be expected, but no individual system has
hitherto been identified that must have been formed by migration. Proximity to
resonance enables the detection of planets perturbing each other. Here we report 
transit timing variations of the four planets in the Kepler-223 system, model
these variations as resonant-angle librations, and compute the long-term
stability of the resonant chain. The architecture of Kepler-223 is too finely
tuned to have been formed by scattering, and our numerical simulations
demonstrate that its properties are natural outcomes of the migration hypothesis.
Similar systems could be destabilized by any of several mechanisms, contributing 
to the observed orbital-period distribution, where many planets are not in
resonances. Planetesimal interactions in particular are thought to be responsible
for establishing the current orbits of the four giant planets in the Solar System
by disrupting a theoretical initial resonant chain similar to that observed in
Kepler-223.

Quiescent galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation dominate the
population of galaxies with masses above 2 × 10(10) times that of the Sun; the
number of quiescent galaxies has increased by a factor of about 25 over the past 
ten billion years (refs 1-4). Once star formation has been shut down, perhaps
during the quasar phase of rapid accretion onto a supermassive black hole, an
unknown mechanism must remove or heat the gas that is subsequently accreted from 
either stellar mass loss or mergers and that would otherwise cool to form stars. 
Energy output from a black hole accreting at a low rate has been proposed, but
observational evidence for this in the form of expanding hot gas shells is
indirect and limited to radio galaxies at the centres of clusters, which are too 
rare to explain the vast majority of the quiescent population. Here we report
bisymmetric emission features co-aligned with strong ionized-gas velocity
gradients from which we infer the presence of centrally driven winds in typical
quiescent galaxies that host low-luminosity active nuclei. These galaxies are
surprisingly common, accounting for as much as ten per cent of the quiescent
population with masses around 2 × 10(10) times that of the Sun. In a prototypical
example, we calculate that the energy input from the galaxy's low-level active
supermassive black hole is capable of driving the observed wind, which contains
sufficient mechanical energy to heat ambient, cooler gas (also detected) and
thereby suppress star formation.

Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a vital process for energy generation, and 
is carried out by complexes within the mitochondria. OXPHOS complexes pose a
unique challenge for cells because their subunits are encoded on both the nuclear
and the mitochondrial genomes. Genomic approaches designed to study
nuclear/cytosolic and bacterial gene expression have not been broadly applied to 
mitochondria, so the co-regulation of OXPHOS genes remains largely unexplored.
Here we monitor mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae during mitochondrial biogenesis, when OXPHOS complexes are
synthesized. We show that nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS transcript
levels do not increase concordantly. Instead, mitochondrial and cytosolic
translation are rapidly, dynamically and synchronously regulated. Furthermore,
cytosolic translation processes control mitochondrial translation
unidirectionally. Thus, the nuclear genome coordinates mitochondrial and
cytosolic translation to orchestrate the timely synthesis of OXPHOS complexes,
representing an unappreciated regulatory layer shaping the mitochondrial
proteome. Our whole-cell genomic profiling approach establishes a foundation for 
studies of global gene regulation in mitochondria.

Brain metastasis represents a substantial source of morbidity and mortality in
various cancers, and is characterized by high resistance to chemotherapy. Here we
define the role of the most abundant cell type in the brain, the astrocyte, in
promoting brain metastasis. We show that human and mouse breast and lung cancer
cells express protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), which promotes the assembly of
carcinoma-astrocyte gap junctions composed of connexin 43 (Cx43). Once engaged
with the astrocyte gap-junctional network, brain metastatic cancer cells use
these channels to transfer the second messenger cGAMP to astrocytes, activating
the STING pathway and production of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-α
(IFNα) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). As paracrine signals, these factors
activate the STAT1 and NF-κB pathways in brain metastatic cells, thereby
supporting tumour growth and chemoresistance. The orally bioavailable modulators 
of gap junctions meclofenamate and tonabersat break this paracrine loop, and we
provide proof-of-principle that these drugs could be used to treat established
brain metastasis.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are derived early from embryonic precursors,
such as haemogenic endothelial cells and pre-haematopoietic stem cells
(pre-HSCs), the molecular identity of which still remains elusive. Here we use
potent surface markers to capture the nascent pre-HSCs at high purity, as
rigorously validated by single-cell-initiated serial transplantation. Then we
apply single-cell RNA sequencing to analyse endothelial cells, CD45(-) and
CD45(+) pre-HSCs in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, and HSCs in fetal liver. 
Pre-HSCs show unique features in transcriptional machinery, arterial signature,
metabolism state, signalling pathway, and transcription factor network.
Functionally, activation of mechanistic targets of rapamycin (mTOR) is shown to
be indispensable for the emergence of HSCs but not haematopoietic progenitors.
Transcriptome data-based functional analysis reveals remarkable heterogeneity in 
cell-cycle status of pre-HSCs. Finally, the core molecular signature of pre-HSCs 
is identified. Collectively, our work paves the way for dissection of complex
molecular mechanisms regulating stepwise generation of HSCs in vivo, informing
future efforts to engineer HSCs for clinical applications.

ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters play critical roles in maintaining sterol
balance in higher eukaryotes. The ABCG5/ABCG8 heterodimer (G5G8) mediates
excretion of neutral sterols in liver and intestines. Mutations disrupting G5G8
cause sitosterolaemia, a disorder characterized by sterol accumulation and
premature atherosclerosis. Here we use crystallization in lipid bilayers to
determine the X-ray structure of human G5G8 in a nucleotide-free state at 3.9 Å
resolution, generating the first atomic model of an ABC sterol transporter. The
structure reveals a new transmembrane fold that is present in a large and
functionally diverse superfamily of ABC transporters. The transmembrane domains
are coupled to the nucleotide-binding sites by networks of interactions that
differ between the active and inactive ATPases, reflecting the catalytic
asymmetry of the transporter. The G5G8 structure provides a mechanistic framework
for understanding sterol transport and the disruptive effects of mutations
causing sitosterolaemia.

Major depressive disorder affects around 16 per cent of the world population at
some point in their lives. Despite the availability of numerous
monoaminergic-based antidepressants, most patients require several weeks, if not 
months, to respond to these treatments, and many patients never attain sustained 
remission of their symptoms. The non-competitive, glutamatergic NMDAR
(N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine exerts rapid and
sustained antidepressant effects after a single dose in patients with depression,
but its use is associated with undesirable side effects. Here we show that the
metabolism of (R,S)-ketamine to (2S,6S;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) is
essential for its antidepressant effects, and that the (2R,6R)-HNK enantiomer
exerts behavioural, electroencephalographic, electrophysiological and cellular
antidepressant-related actions in mice. These antidepressant actions are
independent of NMDAR inhibition but involve early and sustained activation of
AMPARs (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors). We also
establish that (2R,6R)-HNK lacks ketamine-related side effects. Our data
implicate a novel mechanism underlying the antidepressant properties of
(R,S)-ketamine and have relevance for the development of next-generation,
rapid-acting antidepressants.

Our intestinal microbiota harbours a diverse bacterial community required for our
health, sustenance and wellbeing. Intestinal colonization begins at birth and
climaxes with the acquisition of two dominant groups of strict anaerobic bacteria
belonging to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Culture-independent, genomic
approaches have transformed our understanding of the role of the human microbiome
in health and many diseases. However, owing to the prevailing perception that our
indigenous bacteria are largely recalcitrant to culture, many of their functions 
and phenotypes remain unknown. Here we describe a novel workflow based on
targeted phenotypic culturing linked to large-scale whole-genome sequencing,
phylogenetic analysis and computational modelling that demonstrates that a
substantial proportion of the intestinal bacteria are culturable. Applying this
approach to healthy individuals, we isolated 137 bacterial species from
characterized and candidate novel families, genera and species that were archived
as pure cultures. Whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing, combined with
computational and phenotypic analysis, suggests that at least 50-60% of the
bacterial genera from the intestinal microbiota of a healthy individual produce
resilient spores, specialized for host-to-host transmission. Our approach unlocks
the human intestinal microbiota for phenotypic analysis and reveals how a marked 
proportion of oxygen-sensitive intestinal bacteria can be transmitted between
individuals, affecting microbiota heritability.

For more than half a century, high-resolution infrared spectroscopy has played a 
crucial role in probing molecular structure and dynamics. Such studies have so
far been largely restricted to relatively small and simple systems, because at
room temperature even molecules of modest size already occupy many millions of
rotational/vibrational states, yielding highly congested spectra that are
difficult to assign. Targeting more complex molecules requires methods that can
record broadband infrared spectra (that is, spanning multiple vibrational bands) 
with both high resolution and high sensitivity. However, infrared spectroscopic
techniques have hitherto been limited either by narrow bandwidth and long
acquisition time, or by low sensitivity and resolution. Cavity-enhanced direct
frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS) combines the inherent broad bandwidth and
high resolution of an optical frequency comb with the high detection sensitivity 
provided by a high-finesse enhancement cavity, but it still suffers from spectral
congestion. Here we show that this problem can be overcome by using buffer gas
cooling to produce continuous, cold samples of molecules that are then subjected 
to CE-DFCS. This integration allows us to acquire a rotationally resolved direct 
absorption spectrum in the C-H stretching region of nitromethane, a model system 
that challenges our understanding of large-amplitude vibrational motion. We have 
also used this technique on several large organic molecules that are of
fundamental spectroscopic and astrochemical relevance, including naphthalene,
adamantane and hexamethylenetetramine. These findings establish the value of our 
approach for studying much larger and more complex molecules than have been
probed so far, enabling complex molecules and their kinetics to be studied with
orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency, spectral resolution and
specificity.

Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection is a serious threat to public health.
Peptidoglycan biosynthesis is a well-established target for antibiotic
development. MraY (phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase) catalyses the first
and an essential membrane step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. It is considered a 
very promising target for the development of new antibiotics, as many naturally
occurring nucleoside inhibitors with antibacterial activity target this enzyme.
However, antibiotics targeting MraY have not been developed for clinical use,
mainly owing to a lack of structural insight into inhibition of this enzyme. Here
we present the crystal structure of MraY from Aquifex aeolicus (MraYAA) in
complex with its naturally occurring inhibitor, muraymycin D2 (MD2). We show that
after binding MD2, MraYAA undergoes remarkably large conformational
rearrangements near the active site, which lead to the formation of a
nucleoside-binding pocket and a peptide-binding site. MD2 binds the
nucleoside-binding pocket like a two-pronged plug inserting into a socket.
Further interactions it makes in the adjacent peptide-binding site anchor MD2 to 
and enhance its affinity for MraYAA. Surprisingly, MD2 does not interact with
three acidic residues or the Mg(2+) cofactor required for catalysis, suggesting
that MD2 binds to MraYAA in a manner that overlaps with, but is distinct from,
its natural substrate, UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. We have determined the principles
of MD2 binding to MraYAA, including how it avoids the need for pyrophosphate and 
sugar moieties, which are essential features for substrate binding. The
conformational plasticity of MraY could be the reason that it is the target of
many structurally distinct inhibitors. These findings can inform the design of
new inhibitors targeting MraY as well as its paralogues, WecA and TarO.

Obesity and its associated comorbidities (for example, diabetes mellitus and
hepatic steatosis) contribute to approximately 2.5 million deaths annually and
are among the most prevalent and challenging conditions confronting the medical
profession. Neurotensin (NT; also known as NTS), a 13-amino-acid peptide
predominantly localized in specialized enteroendocrine cells of the small
intestine and released by fat ingestion, facilitates fatty acid translocation in 
rat intestine, and stimulates the growth of various cancers. The effects of NT
are mediated through three known NT receptors (NTR1, 2 and 3; also known as
NTSR1, 2, and NTSR3, respectively). Increased fasting plasma levels of pro-NT (a 
stable NT precursor fragment produced in equimolar amounts relative to NT) are
associated with increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality;
however, a role for NT as a causative factor in these diseases is unknown. Here
we show that NT-deficient mice demonstrate significantly reduced intestinal fat
absorption and are protected from obesity, hepatic steatosis and insulin
resistance associated with high fat consumption. We further demonstrate that NT
attenuates the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and stimulates
fatty acid absorption in mice and in cultured intestinal cells, and that this
occurs through a mechanism involving NTR1 and NTR3 (also known as sortilin).
Consistent with the findings in mice, expression of NT in Drosophila midgut
enteroendocrine cells results in increased lipid accumulation in the midgut, fat 
body, and oenocytes (specialized hepatocyte-like cells) and decreased AMPK
activation. Remarkably, in humans, we show that both obese and insulin-resistant 
subjects have elevated plasma concentrations of pro-NT, and in longitudinal
studies among non-obese subjects, high levels of pro-NT denote a doubling of the 
risk of developing obesity later in life. Our findings directly link NT with
increased fat absorption and obesity and suggest that NT may provide a prognostic
marker of future obesity and a potential target for prevention and treatment.

Fitness landscapes depict how genotypes manifest at the phenotypic level and form
the basis of our understanding of many areas of biology, yet their properties
remain elusive. Previous studies have analysed specific genes, often using their 
function as a proxy for fitness, experimentally assessing the effect on function 
of single mutations and their combinations in a specific sequence or in different
sequences. However, systematic high-throughput studies of the local fitness
landscape of an entire protein have not yet been reported. Here we visualize an
extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein 
from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring the native function (fluorescence) of
tens of thousands of derivative genotypes of avGFP. We show that the fitness
landscape of avGFP is narrow, with 3/4 of the derivatives with a single mutation 
showing reduced fluorescence and half of the derivatives with four mutations
being completely non-fluorescent. The narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which 
was detected in up to 30% of genotypes with multiple mutations and mostly
occurred through the cumulative effect of slightly deleterious mutations causing 
a threshold-like decrease in protein stability and a concomitant loss of
fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence divergence spanning hundreds of
millions of years predicted the extent of epistasis in our data, indicating
congruence between the fitness landscape properties at the local and global
scales. The characterization of the local fitness landscape of avGFP has
important implications for several fields including molecular evolution,
population genetics and protein design.

The deep ocean is the largest and least-explored ecosystem on Earth, and a
uniquely energy-poor environment. The distribution, drivers and origins of
deep-sea biodiversity remain unknown at global scales. Here we analyse a database
of more than 165,000 distribution records of Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), a
dominant component of sea-floor fauna, and find patterns of biodiversity unlike
known terrestrial or coastal marine realms. Both patterns and environmental
predictors of deep-sea (2,000-6,500 m) species richness fundamentally differ from
those found in coastal (0-20 m), continental shelf (20-200 m), and upper-slope
(200-2,000 m) waters. Continental shelf to upper-slope richness consistently
peaks in tropical Indo-west Pacific and Caribbean (0-30°) latitudes, and is well 
explained by variations in water temperature. In contrast, deep-sea species show 
maximum richness at higher latitudes (30-50°), concentrated in areas of high
carbon export flux and regions close to continental margins. We reconcile this
structuring of oceanic biodiversity using a species-energy framework, with
kinetic energy predicting shallow-water richness, while chemical energy (export
productivity) and proximity to slope habitats drive deep-sea diversity. Our
findings provide a global baseline for conservation efforts across the sea floor,
and demonstrate that deep-sea ecosystems show a biodiversity pattern consistent
with ecological theory, despite being different from other planetary-scale
habitats.

Climate variations cause ice sheets to retreat and advance, raising or lowering
sea level by metres to decametres. The basic relationship is unambiguous, but the
timing, magnitude and sources of sea-level change remain unclear; in particular, 
the contribution of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is ill defined,
restricting our appreciation of potential future change. Several lines of
evidence suggest possible collapse of the Totten Glacier into interior basins
during past warm periods, most notably the Pliocene epoch, causing several metres
of sea-level rise. However, the structure and long-term evolution of the ice
sheet in this region have been understood insufficiently to constrain past
ice-sheet extents. Here we show that deep ice-sheet erosion-enough to expose
basement rocks-has occurred in two regions: the head of the Totten Glacier,
within 150 kilometres of today's grounding line; and deep within the Sabrina
Subglacial Basin, 350-550 kilometres from this grounding line. Our results, based
on ICECAP aerogeophysical data, demarcate the marginal zones of two distinct
quasi-stable EAIS configurations, corresponding to the 'modern-scale' ice sheet
(with a marginal zone near the present ice-sheet margin) and the retreated ice
sheet (with the marginal zone located far inland). The transitional region of
200-250 kilometres in width is less eroded, suggesting shorter-lived exposure to 
eroding conditions during repeated retreat-advance events, which are probably
driven by ocean-forced instabilities. Representative ice-sheet models indicate
that the global sea-level increase resulting from retreat in this sector can be
up to 0.9 metres in the modern-scale configuration, and exceeds 2 metres in the
retreated configuration.

Interacting compact binary systems provide a natural laboratory in which to study
irradiated substellar objects. As the mass-losing secondary (donor) in these
systems makes a transition from the stellar to the substellar regime, it is also 
irradiated by the primary (compact accretor). The internal and external energy
fluxes are both expected to be comparable in these objects, providing access to
an unexplored irradiation regime. The atmospheric properties of donors are
largely unknown, but could be modified by the irradiation. To constrain models of
donor atmospheres, it is necessary to obtain accurate observational estimates of 
their physical properties (masses, radii, temperatures and albedos). Here we
report the spectroscopic detection and characterization of an irradiated
substellar donor in an accreting white-dwarf binary system. Our near-infrared
observations allow us to determine a model-independent mass estimate for the
donor of 0.055 ± 0.008 solar masses and an average spectral type of L1 ± 1,
supporting both theoretical predictions and model-dependent observational
constraints that suggest that the donor is a brown dwarf. Our time-resolved data 
also allow us to estimate the average irradiation-induced temperature difference 
between the dayside and nightside of the substellar donor (57 kelvin) and the
maximum difference between the hottest and coolest parts of its surface (200
kelvin). The observations are well described by a simple geometric reprocessing
model with a bolometric (Bond) albedo of less than 0.54 at the 2σ confidence
level, consistent with high reprocessing efficiency, but poor lateral heat
redistribution in the atmosphere of the brown-dwarf donor. These results add to
our knowledge of binary evolution, in that the donor has survived the transition 
from the stellar to the substellar regime, and of substellar atmospheres, in that
we have been able to test a regime in which the irradiation and the internal
energy of a brown dwarf are comparable.

In eukaryotic transcription initiation, a large multi-subunit pre-initiation
complex (PIC) that assembles at the core promoter is required for the opening of 
the duplex DNA and identification of the start site for transcription by RNA
polymerase II. Here we use cryo-electron microscropy (cryo-EM) to determine
near-atomic resolution structures of the human PIC in a closed state (engaged
with duplex DNA), an open state (engaged with a transcription bubble), and an
initially transcribing complex (containing six base pairs of DNA-RNA hybrid). Our
studies provide structures for previously uncharacterized components of the PIC, 
such as TFIIE and TFIIH, and segments of TFIIA, TFIIB and TFIIF. Comparison of
the different structures reveals the sequential conformational changes that
accompany the transition from each state to the next throughout the transcription
initiation process. This analysis illustrates the key role of TFIIB in
transcription bubble stabilization and provides strong structural support for a
translocase activity of XPB.

Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes begins with assembly of the RNA 
polymerase (Pol) II initiation complex and promoter DNA opening. Here we report
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of yeast initiation complexes
containing closed and open DNA at resolutions of 8.8 Å and 3.6 Å, respectively.
DNA is positioned and retained over the Pol II cleft by a network of interactions
between the TATA-box-binding protein TBP and transcription factors TFIIA, TFIIB, 
TFIIE, and TFIIF. DNA opening occurs around the tip of the Pol II clamp and the
TFIIE 'extended winged helix' domain, and can occur in the absence of TFIIH.
Loading of the DNA template strand into the active centre may be facilitated by
movements of obstructing protein elements triggered by allosteric binding of the 
TFIIE 'E-ribbon' domain. The results suggest a unified model for transcription
initiation with a key event, the trapping of open promoter DNA by extended
protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts.

Several systems, including contractile tail bacteriophages, the type VI secretion
system and R-type pyocins, use a multiprotein tubular apparatus to attach to and 
penetrate host cell membranes. This macromolecular machine resembles a stretched,
coiled spring (or sheath) wound around a rigid tube with a spike-shaped protein
at its tip. A baseplate structure, which is arguably the most complex part of
this assembly, relays the contraction signal to the sheath. Here we present the
atomic structure of the approximately 6-megadalton bacteriophage T4 baseplate in 
its pre- and post-host attachment states and explain the events that lead to
sheath contraction in atomic detail. We establish the identity and function of a 
minimal set of components that is conserved in all contractile injection systems 
and show that the triggering mechanism is universally conserved.

The chemical modification of structurally complex fermentation products, a
process known as semisynthesis, has been an important tool in the discovery and
manufacture of antibiotics for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
However, many of the therapeutics obtained in this way are no longer effective,
because bacterial resistance to these compounds has developed. Here we present a 
practical, fully synthetic route to macrolide antibiotics by the convergent
assembly of simple chemical building blocks, enabling the synthesis of diverse
structures not accessible by traditional semisynthetic approaches. More than 300 
new macrolide antibiotic candidates, as well as the clinical candidate
solithromycin, have been synthesized using our convergent approach. Evaluation of
these compounds against a panel of pathogenic bacteria revealed that the majority
of these structures had antibiotic activity, some efficacious against strains
resistant to macrolides in current use. The chemistry we describe here provides a
platform for the discovery of new macrolide antibiotics and may also serve as the
basis for their manufacture.

Humans are distinguished from the other living apes in having larger brains and
an unusual life history that combines high reproductive output with slow
childhood growth and exceptional longevity. This suite of derived traits suggests
major changes in energy expenditure and allocation in the human lineage, but
direct measures of human and ape metabolism are needed to compare evolved energy 
strategies among hominoids. Here we used doubly labelled water measurements of
total energy expenditure (TEE; kcal day(-1)) in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos,
gorillas and orangutans to test the hypothesis that the human lineage has
experienced an acceleration in metabolic rate, providing energy for larger brains
and faster reproduction without sacrificing maintenance and longevity. In
multivariate regressions including body size and physical activity, human TEE
exceeded that of chimpanzees and bonobos, gorillas and orangutans by
approximately 400, 635 and 820 kcal day(-1), respectively, readily accommodating 
the cost of humans' greater brain size and reproductive output. Much of the
increase in TEE is attributable to humans' greater basal metabolic rate (kcal
day(-1)), indicating increased organ metabolic activity. Humans also had the
greatest body fat percentage. An increased metabolic rate, along with changes in 
energy allocation, was crucial in the evolution of human brain size and life
history.

Mitochondrial genomes (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA) encode essential oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) components. Because hundreds of mtDNAs exist per cell, a
deletion in a single mtDNA has little impact. However, if the deletion genome is 
enriched, OXPHOS declines, resulting in cellular dysfunction. For example,
Kearns-Sayre syndrome is caused by a single heteroplasmic mtDNA deletion. More
broadly, mtDNA deletion accumulation has been observed in individual muscle cells
and dopaminergic neurons during ageing. It is unclear how mtDNA deletions are
tolerated or how they are propagated in somatic cells. One mechanism by which
cells respond to OXPHOS dysfunction is by activating the mitochondrial unfolded
protein response (UPR(mt)), a transcriptional response mediated by the
transcription factor ATFS-1 that promotes the recovery and regeneration of
defective mitochondria. Here we investigate the role of ATFS-1 in the maintenance
and propagation of a deleterious mtDNA in a heteroplasmic Caenorhabditis elegans 
strain that stably expresses wild-type mtDNA and mtDNA with a 3.1-kilobase
deletion (∆mtDNA) lacking four essential genes. The heteroplasmic strain, which
has 60% ∆mtDNA, displays modest mitochondrial dysfunction and constitutive
UPR(mt) activation. ATFS-1 impairment reduced the ∆mtDNA nearly tenfold,
decreasing the total percentage to 7%. We propose that in the context of mtDNA
heteroplasmy, UPR(mt) activation caused by OXPHOS defects propagates or maintains
the deleterious mtDNA in an attempt to recover OXPHOS activity by promoting
mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics.

materials remains a challenge and an active area of development. More challenging
is the design of dynamic 2D lattices that can undergo large-scale motions without
loss of crystallinity. Dynamic behaviour in porous three-dimensional (3D)
crystalline solids has been exploited for stimuli-responsive functions and
adaptive behaviour. As in such 3D materials, integrating flexibility and
adaptiveness into crystalline 2D lattices would greatly broaden the functional
scope of 2D materials. Here we report the self-assembly of unsupported, 2D
protein lattices with precise spatial arrangements and patterns using a readily
accessible design strategy. Three single- or double-point mutants of the
C4-symmetric protein RhuA were designed to assemble via different modes of
intermolecular interactions (single-disulfide, double-disulfide and
metal-coordination) into crystalline 2D arrays. Owing to the flexibility of the
single-disulfide interactions, the lattices of one of the variants ((C98)RhuA)
are essentially defect-free and undergo substantial, but fully correlated,
changes in molecular arrangement, yielding coherently dynamic 2D molecular
lattices. (C98)RhuA lattices display a Poisson's ratio of -1-the lowest
thermodynamically possible value for an isotropic material-making them auxetic.

For goal-directed behaviour it is critical that we can both select the
appropriate action and learn to modify the underlying movements (for example, the
pitch of a note or velocity of a reach) to improve outcomes. The basal ganglia
are a critical nexus where circuits necessary for the production of behaviour,
such as the neocortex and thalamus, are integrated with reward signalling to
reinforce successful, purposive actions. The dorsal striatum, a major input
structure of basal ganglia, is composed of two opponent pathways, direct and
indirect, thought to select actions that elicit positive outcomes and suppress
actions that do not, respectively. Activity-dependent plasticity modulated by
reward is thought to be sufficient for selecting actions in the striatum.
Although perturbations of basal ganglia function produce profound changes in
movement, it remains unknown whether activity-dependent plasticity is sufficient 
to produce learned changes in movement kinematics, such as velocity. Here we use 
cell-type-specific stimulation in mice delivered in closed loop during movement
to demonstrate that activity in either the direct or indirect pathway is
sufficient to produce specific and sustained increases or decreases in velocity, 
without affecting action selection or motivation. These behavioural changes were 
a form of learning that accumulated over trials, persisted after the cessation of
stimulation, and were abolished in the presence of dopamine antagonists. Our
results reveal that the direct and indirect pathways can each bidirectionally
control movement velocity, demonstrating unprecedented specificity and
flexibility in the control of volition by the basal ganglia.

In salamanders, grafting of a left limb blastema onto a right limb stump yields
regeneration of three limbs, the normal limb and two 'supernumerary' limbs. This 
experiment and other research have shown that the juxtaposition of anterior and
posterior limb tissue plus innervation are necessary and sufficient to induce
complete limb regeneration in salamanders. However, the cellular and molecular
basis of the requirement for anterior-posterior tissue interactions were unknown.
Here we have clarified the molecular basis of the requirement for both anterior
and posterior tissue during limb regeneration and supernumerary limb formation in
axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum). We show that the two tissues provide
complementary cross-inductive signals that are required for limb outgrowth. A
blastema composed solely of anterior tissue normally regresses rather than
forming a limb, but activation of hedgehog (HH) signalling was sufficient to
drive regeneration of an anterior blastema to completion owing to its ability to 
maintain fibroblast growth factor (FGF) expression, the key signalling activity
responsible for blastema outgrowth. In blastemas composed solely of posterior
tissue, HH signalling was not sufficient to drive regeneration; however, ectopic 
expression of FGF8 together with endogenous HH signalling was sufficient. In
axolotls, FGF8 is expressed only in the anterior mesenchyme and maintenance of
its expression depends on sonic hedgehog (SHH) signalling from posterior tissue. 
Together, our findings identify key anteriorly and posteriorly localized signals 
that promote limb regeneration and show that these single factors are sufficient 
to drive non-regenerating blastemas to complete regeneration with full
elaboration of skeletal elements.

The olefin metathesis reaction of two unsaturated substrates is one of the most
powerful carbon-carbon-bond-forming reactions in organic chemistry. Specifically,
the catalytic olefin metathesis reaction has led to profound developments in the 
synthesis of molecules relevant to the petroleum, materials, agricultural and
pharmaceutical industries. These reactions are characterized by their use of
discrete metal alkylidene catalysts that operate via a well-established
mechanism. While the corresponding carbonyl-olefin metathesis reaction can also
be used to construct carbon-carbon bonds, currently available methods are scarce 
and severely hampered by either harsh reaction conditions or the required use of 
stoichiometric transition metals as reagents. To date, no general protocol for
catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis has been reported. Here we demonstrate a
catalytic carbonyl-olefin ring-closing metathesis reaction that uses iron, an
Earth-abundant and environmentally benign transition metal, as a catalyst. This
transformation accommodates a variety of substrates and is distinguished by its
operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions, high functional-group
tolerance, and amenability to gram-scale synthesis. We anticipate that these
characteristics, coupled with the efficiency of this reaction, will allow for
further advances in areas that have historically been enhanced by olefin
metathesis.

The Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, which occurred about 51 to 53 million
years ago), was the warmest interval of the past 65 million years, with mean
annual surface air temperature over ten degrees Celsius warmer than during the
pre-industrial period. Subsequent global cooling in the middle and late Eocene
epoch, especially at high latitudes, eventually led to continental ice sheet
development in Antarctica in the early Oligocene epoch (about 33.6 million years 
ago). However, existing estimates place atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels
during the Eocene at 500-3,000 parts per million, and in the absence of tighter
constraints carbon-climate interactions over this interval remain uncertain. Here
we use recent analytical and methodological developments to generate a new
high-fidelity record of CO2 concentrations using the boron isotope (δ(11)B)
composition of well preserved planktonic foraminifera from the Tanzania Drilling 
Project, revising previous estimates. Although species-level uncertainties make
absolute values difficult to constrain, CO2 concentrations during the EECO were
around 1,400 parts per million. The relative decline in CO2 concentration through
the Eocene is more robustly constrained at about fifty per cent, with a further
decline into the Oligocene. Provided the latitudinal dependency of sea surface
temperature change for a given climate forcing in the Eocene was similar to that 
of the late Quaternary period, this CO2 decline was sufficient to drive the well 
documented high- and low-latitude cooling that occurred through the Eocene. Once 
the change in global temperature between the pre-industrial period and the Eocene
caused by the action of all known slow feedbacks (apart from those associated
with the carbon cycle) is removed, both the EECO and the late Eocene exhibit an
equilibrium climate sensitivity relative to the pre-industrial period of 2.1 to
4.6 degrees Celsius per CO2 doubling (66 per cent confidence), which is similar
to the canonical range (1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius), indicating that a large
fraction of the warmth of the early Eocene greenhouse was driven by increased CO2
concentrations, and that climate sensitivity was relatively constant throughout
this period.

Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at 
a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic
diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation
correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions
and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response
to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach
to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target 
DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone 
cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine
deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do
not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to
uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base
editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and
can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease.
In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation
base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase 
targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to
favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of
~15-75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1%) indel formation. Base 
editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.

Zika virus (ZIKV), formerly a neglected pathogen, has recently been associated
with microcephaly in fetuses, and with Guillian-Barré syndrome in adults. Here we
present the 3.7 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of ZIKV, and show
that the overall architecture of the virus is similar to that of other
flaviviruses. Sequence and structural comparisons of the ZIKV envelope (E)
protein with other flaviviruses show that parts of the E protein closely resemble
the neurovirulent West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses, while others are
similar to dengue virus (DENV). However, the contribution of the E protein to
flavivirus pathobiology is currently not understood. The virus particle was
observed to be structurally stable even when incubated at 40 °C, in sharp
contrast to the less thermally stable DENV. This is also reflected in the
infectivity of ZIKV compared to DENV serotypes 2 and 4 (DENV2 and DENV4) at
different temperatures. The cryo-electron microscopy structure shows a virus with
a more compact surface. This structural stability of the virus may help it to
survive in the harsh conditions of semen, saliva and urine. Antibodies or drugs
that destabilize the structure may help to reduce the disease outcome or limit
the spread of the virus.

Volcanic hotspot tracks featuring linear progressions in the age of volcanism are
typical surface expressions of plate tectonic movement on top of narrow plumes of
hot material within Earth's mantle. Seismic imaging reveals that these plumes can
be of deep origin--probably rooted on thermochemical structures in the lower
mantle. Although palaeomagnetic and radiometric age data suggest that mantle flow
can advect plume conduits laterally, the flow dynamics underlying the formation
of the sharp bend occurring only in the Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track in the
Pacific Ocean remains enigmatic. Here we present palaeogeographically constrained
numerical models of thermochemical convection and demonstrate that flow in the
deep lower mantle under the north Pacific was anomalously vigorous between 100
million years ago and 50 million years ago as a consequence of long-lasting
subduction systems, unlike those in the south Pacific. These models show a sharp 
bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor hotspot track arising from the interplay of plume
tilt and the lateral advection of plume sources. The different trajectories of
the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspot tracks arise from asymmetric deformation of
thermochemical structures under the Pacific between 100 million years ago and 50 
million years ago. This asymmetric deformation waned just before the
Hawaiian-Emperor bend developed, owing to flow in the deepest lower mantle
associated with slab descent in the north and south Pacific.

It is widely accepted that Earth's early atmosphere contained less than 0.001 per
cent of the present-day atmospheric oxygen (O2) level, until the Great Oxidation 
Event resulted in a major rise in O2 concentration about 2.4 billion years ago.
There are multiple lines of evidence for low O2 concentrations on early Earth,
but all previous observations relate to the composition of the lower atmosphere
in the Archaean era; to date no method has been developed to sample the Archaean 
upper atmosphere. We have extracted fossil micrometeorites from limestone
sedimentary rock that had accumulated slowly 2.7 billion years ago before being
preserved in Australia's Pilbara region. We propose that these micrometeorites
formed when sand-sized particles entered Earth's atmosphere and melted at
altitudes of about 75 to 90 kilometres (given an atmospheric density similar to
that of today). Here we show that the FeNi metal in the resulting cosmic
spherules was oxidized while molten, and quench-crystallized to form spheres of
interlocking dendritic crystals primarily of magnetite (Fe3O4), with wüstite
(FeO)+metal preserved in a few particles. Our model of atmospheric micrometeorite
oxidation suggests that Archaean upper-atmosphere oxygen concentrations may have 
been close to those of the present-day Earth, and that the ratio of oxygen to
carbon monoxide was sufficiently high to prevent noticeable inhibition of
oxidation by carbon monoxide. The anomalous sulfur isotope (Δ(33)S) signature of 
pyrite (FeS2) in seafloor sediments from this period, which requires an anoxic
surface environment, implies that there may have been minimal mixing between the 
upper and lower atmosphere during the Archaean.

The laboratory synthesis of complex organic molecules relies heavily on the
introduction and manipulation of functional groups, such as carbon-oxygen or
carbon-halogen bonds; carbon-hydrogen bonds are far less reactive and harder to
functionalize selectively. The idea of C-H functionalization, in which C-H bonds 
are modified at will instead of the functional groups, represents a paradigm
shift in the standard logic of organic synthesis. For this approach to be
generally useful, effective strategies for site-selective C-H functionalization
need to be developed. The most practical solutions to the site-selectivity
problem rely on either intramolecular reactions or the use of directing groups
within the substrate. A challenging, but potentially more flexible approach,
would be to use catalyst control to determine which site in a particular
substrate would be functionalized. Here we describe the use of dirhodium
catalysts to achieve highly site-selective, diastereoselective and
enantioselective C-H functionalization of n-alkanes and terminally substituted
n-alkyl compounds. The reactions proceed in high yield, and functional groups
such as halides, silanes and esters are compatible with this chemistry. These
studies demonstrate that high site selectivity is possible in C-H
functionalization reactions without the need for a directing or anchoring group
present in the molecule.

Ever since Ernest Rutherford scattered α-particles from gold foils, collision
experiments have revealed insights into atoms, nuclei and elementary particles.
In solids, many-body correlations lead to characteristic resonances--called
quasiparticles--such as excitons, dropletons, polarons and Cooper pairs. The
structure and dynamics of quasiparticles are important because they define
macroscopic phenomena such as Mott insulating states, spontaneous spin- and
charge-order, and high-temperature superconductivity. However, the extremely
short lifetimes of these entities make practical implementations of a suitable
collider challenging. Here we exploit lightwave-driven charge transport, the
foundation of attosecond science, to explore ultrafast quasiparticle collisions
directly in the time domain: a femtosecond optical pulse creates excitonic
electron-hole pairs in the layered dichalcogenide tungsten diselenide while a
strong terahertz field accelerates and collides the electrons with the holes. The
underlying dynamics of the wave packets, including collision, pair annihilation, 
quantum interference and dephasing, are detected as light emission in high-order 
spectral sidebands of the optical excitation. A full quantum theory explains our 
observations microscopically. This approach enables collision experiments with
various complex quasiparticles and suggests a promising new way of generating
sub-femtosecond pulses.

Antibiotic-resistant infections annually claim hundreds of thousands of lives
worldwide. This problem is exacerbated by exchange of resistance genes between
pathogens and benign microbes from diverse habitats. Mapping resistance gene
dissemination between humans and their environment is a public health priority.
Here we characterized the bacterial community structure and resistance exchange
networks of hundreds of interconnected human faecal and environmental samples
from two low-income Latin American communities. We found that resistomes across
habitats are generally structured by bacterial phylogeny along ecological
gradients, but identified key resistance genes that cross habitat boundaries and 
determined their association with mobile genetic elements. We also assessed the
effectiveness of widely used excreta management strategies in reducing faecal
bacteria and resistance genes in these settings representative of low- and
middle-income countries. Our results lay the foundation for quantitative risk
assessment and surveillance of resistance gene dissemination across
interconnected habitats in settings representing over two-thirds of the world's
population.

Monsoons are the dominant seasonal mode of climate variability in the tropics and
are critically important conveyors of atmospheric moisture and energy at a global
scale. Predicting monsoons, which have profound impacts on regions that are
collectively home to more than 70 per cent of Earth's population, is a challenge 
that is difficult to overcome by relying on instrumental data from only the past 
few decades. Palaeoclimatic evidence of monsoon rainfall dynamics across
different regions and timescales could help us to understand and predict the
sensitivity and response of monsoons to various forcing mechanisms. This evidence
suggests that monsoon systems exhibit substantial regional character.

Implantation of the blastocyst is a developmental milestone in mammalian
embryonic development. At this time, a coordinated program of lineage
diversification, cell-fate specification, and morphogenetic movements establishes
the generation of extra-embryonic tissues and the embryo proper, and determines
the conditions for successful pregnancy and gastrulation. Despite its basic and
clinical importance, this process remains mysterious in humans. Here we report
the use of a novel in vitro system to study the post-implantation development of 
the human embryo. We unveil the self-organizing abilities and autonomy of in
vitro attached human embryos. We find human-specific molecular signatures of
early cell lineage, timing, and architecture. Embryos display key landmarks of
normal development, including epiblast expansion, lineage segregation, bi-laminar
disc formation, amniotic and yolk sac cavitation, and trophoblast
diversification. Our findings highlight the species-specificity of these
developmental events and provide a new understanding of early human embryonic
development beyond the blastocyst stage. In addition, our study establishes a new
model system relevant to early human pregnancy loss. Finally, our work will also 
assist in the rational design of differentiation protocols of human embryonic
stem cells to specific cell types for disease modelling and cell replacement
therapy.

Sunspots are cool areas caused by strong surface magnetic fields that inhibit
convection. Moreover, strong magnetic fields can alter the average atmospheric
structure, degrading our ability to measure stellar masses and ages. Stars that
are more active than the Sun have more and stronger dark spots than does the Sun,
including on the rotational pole. Doppler imaging, which has so far produced the 
most detailed images of surface structures on other stars, cannot always
distinguish the hemisphere in which the starspots are located, especially in the 
equatorial region and if the data quality is not optimal. This leads to problems 
in investigating the north-south distribution of starspot active latitudes (those
latitudes with more starspot activity); this distribution is a crucial constraint
of dynamo theory. Polar spots, whose existence is inferred from Doppler
tomography, could plausibly be observational artefacts. Here we report imaging of
the old, magnetically active star ζ Andromedae using long-baseline infrared
interferometry. In our data, a dark polar spot is seen in each of two observation
epochs, whereas lower-latitude spot structures in both hemispheres do not persist
between observations, revealing global starspot asymmetries. The north-south
symmetry of active latitudes observed on the Sun is absent on ζ And, which hosts 
global spot patterns that cannot be produced by solar-type dynamos.

Whether and how neurons that are present in both sexes of the same species can
differentiate in a sexually dimorphic manner is not well understood. A comparison
of the connectomes of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite and male nervous
systems reveals the existence of sexually dimorphic synaptic connections between 
neurons present in both sexes. Here we demonstrate sex-specific functions of
these sex-shared neurons and show that many neurons initially form synapses in a 
hybrid manner in both the male and hermaphrodite pattern before sexual
maturation. Sex-specific synapse pruning then results in the sex-specific
maintenance of subsets of these connections. Reversal of the sexual identity of
either the pre- or postsynaptic neuron alone transforms the patterns of synaptic 
connectivity to that of the opposite sex. A dimorphically expressed and
phylogenetically conserved transcription factor is both necessary and sufficient 
to determine sex-specific connectivity patterns. Our studies reveal new insights 
into sex-specific circuit development.

Conformational selection and induced fit are two prevailing mechanisms to explain
the molecular basis for ligand-based activation of receptors. G-protein-coupled
receptors are the largest class of cell surface receptors and are important drug 
targets. A molecular understanding of their activation mechanism is critical for 
drug discovery and design. However, direct evidence that addresses how agonist
binding leads to the formation of an active receptor state is scarce. Here we use
(19)F nuclear magnetic resonance to quantify the conformational landscape
occupied by the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), a prototypical class A
G-protein-coupled receptor. We find an ensemble of four states in equilibrium:
(1) two inactive states in millisecond exchange, consistent with a formed (state 
S1) and a broken (state S2) salt bridge (known as 'ionic lock') between
transmembrane helices 3 and 6; and (2) two active states, S3 and S3', as
identified by binding of a G-protein-derived peptide. In contrast to a recent
study of the β2-adrenergic receptor, the present approach allowed identification 
of a second active state for A2AR. Addition of inverse agonist (ZM241385)
increases the population of the inactive states, while full agonists (UK432097 or
NECA) stabilize the active state, S3', in a manner consistent with conformational
selection. In contrast, partial agonist (LUF5834) and an allosteric modulator
(HMA) exclusively increase the population of the S3 state. Thus, partial agonism 
is achieved here by conformational selection of a distinct active state which we 
predict will have compromised coupling to the G protein. Direct observation of
the conformational equilibria of ligand-dependent G-protein-coupled receptor and 
deduction of the underlying mechanisms of receptor activation will have
wide-reaching implications for our understanding of the function of
G-protein-coupled receptor in health and disease.

Mitochondria from many eukaryotic clades take up large amounts of calcium
(Ca(2+)) via an inner membrane transporter called the uniporter. Transport by the
uniporter is membrane potential dependent and sensitive to ruthenium red or its
derivative Ru360 (ref. 1). Electrophysiological studies have shown that the
uniporter is an ion channel with remarkably high conductance and selectivity.
Ca(2+) entry into mitochondria is also known to activate the tricarboxylic acid
cycle and seems to be crucial for matching the production of ATP in mitochondria 
with its cytosolic demand. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is the
pore-forming and Ca(2+)-conducting subunit of the uniporter holocomplex, but its 
primary sequence does not resemble any calcium channel studied to date. Here we
report the structure of the pore domain of MCU from Caenorhabditis elegans,
determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy (EM).
MCU is a homo-oligomer in which the second transmembrane helix forms a
hydrophilic pore across the membrane. The channel assembly represents a new
solution of ion channel architecture, and is stabilized by a coiled-coil motif
protruding into the mitochondrial matrix. The critical DXXE motif forms the pore 
entrance, which features two carboxylate rings; based on the ring dimensions and 
functional mutagenesis, these rings appear to form the selectivity filter. To our
knowledge, this is one of the largest membrane protein structures characterized
by NMR, and provides a structural blueprint for understanding the function of
this channel.

Star-like objects with effective temperatures of less than 2,700 kelvin are
referred to as 'ultracool dwarfs'. This heterogeneous group includes stars of
extremely low mass as well as brown dwarfs (substellar objects not massive enough
to sustain hydrogen fusion), and represents about 15 per cent of the population
of astronomical objects near the Sun. Core-accretion theory predicts that, given 
the small masses of these ultracool dwarfs, and the small sizes of their
protoplanetary disks, there should be a large but hitherto undetected population 
of terrestrial planets orbiting them--ranging from metal-rich Mercury-sized
planets to more hospitable volatile-rich Earth-sized planets. Here we report
observations of three short-period Earth-sized planets transiting an ultracool
dwarf star only 12 parsecs away. The inner two planets receive four times and two
times the irradiation of Earth, respectively, placing them close to the inner
edge of the habitable zone of the star. Our data suggest that 11 orbits remain
possible for the third planet, the most likely resulting in irradiation
significantly less than that received by Earth. The infrared brightness of the
host star, combined with its Jupiter-like size, offers the possibility of
thoroughly characterizing the components of this nearby planetary system.

In eukaryotes, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C, also known as the
cyclosome) regulates the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of specific cell-cycle
proteins to coordinate chromosome segregation in mitosis and entry into the G1
phase. The catalytic activity of the APC/C and its ability to specify the
destruction of particular proteins at different phases of the cell cycle are
controlled by its interaction with two structurally related coactivator subunits,
Cdc20 and Cdh1. Coactivators recognize substrate degrons, and enhance the
affinity of the APC/C for its cognate E2 (refs 4-6). During mitosis,
cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and polo-like kinase (Plk) control Cdc20- and
Cdh1-mediated activation of the APC/C. Hyperphosphorylation of APC/C subunits,
notably Apc1 and Apc3, is required for Cdc20 to activate the APC/C, whereas
phosphorylation of Cdh1 prevents its association with the APC/C. Since both
coactivators associate with the APC/C through their common C-box and Ile-Arg tail
motifs, the mechanism underlying this differential regulation is unclear, as is
the role of specific APC/C phosphorylation sites. Here, using cryo-electron
microscopy and biochemical analysis, we define the molecular basis of how
phosphorylation of human APC/C allows for its control by Cdc20. An
auto-inhibitory segment of Apc1 acts as a molecular switch that in apo
unphosphorylated APC/C interacts with the C-box binding site and obstructs
engagement of Cdc20. Phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory segment displaces it 
from the C-box-binding site. Efficient phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory
segment, and thus relief of auto-inhibition, requires the recruitment of
Cdk-cyclin in complex with a Cdk regulatory subunit (Cks) to a
hyperphosphorylated loop of Apc3. We also find that the small-molecule inhibitor,
tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, preferentially suppresses APC/C(Cdc20) rather than
APC/C(Cdh1), and interacts with the binding sites of both the C-box and Ile-Arg
tail motifs. Our results reveal the mechanism for the regulation of mitotic APC/C
by phosphorylation and provide a rationale for the development of selective
inhibitors of this state.

Glucagon is a 29-amino-acid peptide released from the α-cells of the islet of
Langerhans, which has a key role in glucose homeostasis. Glucagon action is
transduced by the class B G-protein-coupled glucagon receptor (GCGR), which is
located on liver, kidney, intestinal smooth muscle, brain, adipose tissue, heart 
and pancreas cells, and this receptor has been considered an important drug
target in the treatment of diabetes. Administration of recently identified
small-molecule GCGR antagonists in patients with type 2 diabetes results in a
substantial reduction of fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations.
Although an X-ray structure of the transmembrane domain of the GCGR has
previously been solved, the ligand (NNC0640) was not resolved. Here we report the
2.5 Å structure of human GCGR in complex with the antagonist MK-0893 (ref. 4),
which is found to bind to an allosteric site outside the seven transmembrane
(7TM) helical bundle in a position between TM6 and TM7 extending into the lipid
bilayer. Mutagenesis of key residues identified in the X-ray structure confirms
their role in the binding of MK-0893 to the receptor. The unexpected position of 
the binding site for MK-0893, which is structurally similar to other GCGR
antagonists, suggests that glucagon activation of the receptor is prevented by
restriction of the outward helical movement of TM6 required for G-protein
coupling. Structural knowledge of class B receptors is limited, with only one
other ligand-binding site defined--for the corticotropin-releasing hormone
receptor 1 (CRF1R)--which was located deep within the 7TM bundle. We describe a
completely novel allosteric binding site for class B receptors, providing an
opportunity for structure-based drug design for this receptor class and
furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of activation of these receptors.

Cooperative phenotypes are considered central to the functioning of microbial
communities in many contexts, including communication via quorum sensing, biofilm
formation, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenesis. The human intestine houses a 
dense and diverse microbial community critical to health, yet we know little
about cooperation within this important ecosystem. Here we test experimentally
for evolved cooperation within the Bacteroidales, the dominant Gram-negative
bacteria of the human intestine. We show that during growth on certain dietary
polysaccharides, the model member Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron exhibits only
limited cooperation. Although this organism digests these polysaccharides
extracellularly, mutants lacking this ability are outcompeted. In contrast, we
discovered a dedicated cross-feeding enzyme system in the prominent gut symbiont 
Bacteroides ovatus, which digests polysaccharide at a cost to itself but at a
benefit to another species. Using in vitro systems and gnotobiotic mouse
colonization models, we find that extracellular digestion of inulin increases the
fitness of B. ovatus owing to reciprocal benefits when it feeds other gut species
such as Bacteroides vulgatus. This is a rare example of naturally-evolved
cooperation between microbial species. Our study reveals both the complexity and 
importance of cooperative phenotypes within the mammalian intestinal microbiota.

New World monkeys (platyrrhines) are a diverse part of modern tropical ecosystems
in North and South America, yet their early evolutionary history in the tropics
is largely unknown. Molecular divergence estimates suggest that primates arrived 
in tropical Central America, the southern-most extent of the North American
landmass, with several dispersals from South America starting with the emergence 
of the Isthmus of Panama 3-4 million years ago (Ma). The complete absence of
primate fossils from Central America has, however, limited our understanding of
their history in the New World. Here we present the first description of a fossil
monkey recovered from the North American landmass, the oldest known crown
platyrrhine, from a precisely dated 20.9-Ma layer in the Las Cascadas Formation
in the Panama Canal Basin, Panama. This discovery suggests that family-level
diversification of extant New World monkeys occurred in the tropics, with new
divergence estimates for Cebidae between 22 and 25 Ma, and provides the oldest
fossil evidence for mammalian interchange between South and North America. The
timing is consistent with recent tectonic reconstructions of a relatively narrow 
Central American Seaway in the early Miocene epoch, coincident with over-water
dispersals inferred for many other groups of animals and plants. Discovery of an 
early Miocene primate in Panama provides evidence for a circum-Caribbean tropical
distribution of New World monkeys by this time, with ocean barriers not wholly
restricting their northward movements, requiring a complex set of ecological
factors to explain their absence in well-sampled similarly aged localities at
higher latitudes of North America.

The whole-genome duplication 80 million years ago of the common ancestor of
salmonids (salmonid-specific fourth vertebrate whole-genome duplication, Ss4R)
provides unique opportunities to learn about the evolutionary fate of a
duplicated vertebrate genome in 70 extant lineages. Here we present a
high-quality genome assembly for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and show that
large genomic reorganizations, coinciding with bursts of transposon-mediated
repeat expansions, were crucial for the post-Ss4R rediploidization process.
Comparisons of duplicate gene expression patterns across a wide range of tissues 
with orthologous genes from a pre-Ss4R outgroup unexpectedly demonstrate far more
instances of neofunctionalization than subfunctionalization. Surprisingly, we
find that genes that were retained as duplicates after the teleost-specific
whole-genome duplication 320 million years ago were not more likely to be
retained after the Ss4R, and that the duplicate retention was not influenced to a
great extent by the nature of the predicted protein interactions of the gene
products. Finally, we demonstrate that the Atlantic salmon assembly can serve as 
a reference sequence for the study of other salmonids for a range of purposes.

Millions of people worldwide suffer from diseases that lead to paralysis through 
disruption of signal pathways between the brain and the muscles. Neuroprosthetic 
devices are designed to restore lost function and could be used to form an
electronic 'neural bypass' to circumvent disconnected pathways in the nervous
system. It has previously been shown that intracortically recorded signals can be
decoded to extract information related to motion, allowing non-human primates and
paralysed humans to control computers and robotic arms through imagined
movements. In non-human primates, these types of signal have also been used to
drive activation of chemically paralysed arm muscles. Here we show that
intracortically recorded signals can be linked in real-time to muscle activation 
to restore movement in a paralysed human. We used a chronically implanted
intracortical microelectrode array to record multiunit activity from the motor
cortex in a study participant with quadriplegia from cervical spinal cord injury.
We applied machine-learning algorithms to decode the neuronal activity and
control activation of the participant's forearm muscles through a custom-built
high-resolution neuromuscular electrical stimulation system. The system provided 
isolated finger movements and the participant achieved continuous cortical
control of six different wrist and hand motions. Furthermore, he was able to use 
the system to complete functional tasks relevant to daily living. Clinical
assessment showed that, when using the system, his motor impairment improved from
the fifth to the sixth cervical (C5-C6) to the seventh cervical to first thoracic
(C7-T1) level unilaterally, conferring on him the critical abilities to grasp,
manipulate, and release objects. This is the first demonstration to our knowledge
of successful control of muscle activation using intracortically recorded signals
in a paralysed human. These results have significant implications in advancing
neuroprosthetic technology for people worldwide living with the effects of
paralysis.

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a subset of T cells carrying the CD4 antigen;
they are important in supporting plasma cell and germinal centre responses. The
initial induction of Tfh cell properties occurs within the first few days after
activation by antigen recognition on dendritic cells, although how dendritic
cells promote this cell-fate decision is not fully understood. Moreover, although
Tfh cells are uniquely defined by expression of the follicle-homing receptor
CXCR5 (refs 1, 2), the guidance receptor promoting the earlier localization of
activated T cells at the interface of the B-cell follicle and T zone has been
unclear. Here we show that the G-protein-coupled receptor EBI2 (GPR183) and its
ligand 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol mediate positioning of activated CD4 T cells at
the interface of the follicle and T zone. In this location they interact with
activated dendritic cells and are exposed to Tfh-cell-promoting inducible
co-stimulator (ICOS) ligand. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine that has multiple
influences on T-cell fate, including negative regulation of Tfh cell
differentiation. We demonstrate that activated dendritic cells in the outer T
zone further augment Tfh cell differentiation by producing membrane and soluble
forms of CD25, the IL-2 receptor α-chain, and quenching T-cell-derived IL-2. Mice
lacking EBI2 in T cells or CD25 in dendritic cells have reduced Tfh cells and
mount defective T-cell-dependent plasma cell and germinal centre responses. These
findings demonstrate that distinct niches within the lymphoid organ T zone
support distinct cell fate decisions, and they establish a function for
dendritic-cell-derived CD25 in controlling IL-2 availability and T-cell
differentiation.

Despite the magnitude of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa,
there is still a fundamental lack of knowledge about the pathophysiology of EVD. 
In particular, very little is known about human immune responses to Ebola virus. 
Here we evaluate the physiology of the human T cell immune response in EVD
patients at the time of admission to the Ebola Treatment Center in Guinea, and
longitudinally until discharge or death. Through the use of multiparametric flow 
cytometry established by the European Mobile Laboratory in the field, we identify
an immune signature that is unique in EVD fatalities. Fatal EVD was characterized
by a high percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing the inhibitory
molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, which correlated with elevated inflammatory markers
and high virus load. Conversely, surviving individuals showed significantly lower
expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 as well as lower inflammation, despite comparable
overall T cell activation. Concomitant with virus clearance, survivors mounted a 
robust Ebola-virus-specific T cell response. Our findings suggest that
dysregulation of the T cell response is a key component of EVD pathophysiology.

Inorganic-organic hybrid materials such as organically templated metal oxides,
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and organohalide perovskites have been studied
for decades, and hydrothermal and (non-aqueous) solvothermal syntheses have
produced thousands of new materials that collectively contain nearly all the
metals in the periodic table. Nevertheless, the formation of these compounds is
not fully understood, and development of new compounds relies primarily on
exploratory syntheses. Simulation- and data-driven approaches (promoted by
efforts such as the Materials Genome Initiative) provide an alternative to
experimental trial-and-error. Three major strategies are: simulation-based
predictions of physical properties (for example, charge mobility, photovoltaic
properties, gas adsorption capacity or lithium-ion intercalation) to identify
promising target candidates for synthetic efforts; determination of the
structure-property relationship from large bodies of experimental data, enabled
by integration with high-throughput synthesis and measurement tools; and
clustering on the basis of similar crystallographic structure (for example,
zeolite structure classification or gas adsorption properties). Here we
demonstrate an alternative approach that uses machine-learning algorithms trained
on reaction data to predict reaction outcomes for the crystallization of
templated vanadium selenites. We used information on 'dark' reactions--failed or 
unsuccessful hydrothermal syntheses--collected from archived laboratory notebooks
from our laboratory, and added physicochemical property descriptions to the raw
notebook information using cheminformatics techniques. We used the resulting data
to train a machine-learning model to predict reaction success. When carrying out 
hydrothermal synthesis experiments using previously untested, commercially
available organic building blocks, our machine-learning model outperformed
traditional human strategies, and successfully predicted conditions for new
organically templated inorganic product formation with a success rate of 89 per
cent. Inverting the machine-learning model reveals new hypotheses regarding the
conditions for successful product formation.

Today's most precise time and frequency measurements are performed with optical
atomic clocks. However, it has been proposed that they could potentially be
outperformed by a nuclear clock, which employs a nuclear transition instead of an
atomic shell transition. There is only one known nuclear state that could serve
as a nuclear clock using currently available technology, namely, the isomeric
first excited state of (229)Th (denoted (229m)Th). Here we report the direct
detection of this nuclear state, which is further confirmation of the existence
of the isomer and lays the foundation for precise studies of its decay
parameters. On the basis of this direct detection, the isomeric energy is
constrained to between 6.3 and 18.3 electronvolts, and the half-life is found to 
be longer than 60 seconds for (229m)Th(2+). More precise determinations appear to
be within reach, and would pave the way to the development of a nuclear frequency
standard.

The Bacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxins (Bt toxins) are widely used insecticidal 
proteins in engineered crops that provide agricultural, economic, and
environmental benefits. The development of insect resistance to Bt toxins
endangers their long-term effectiveness. Here we have developed a phage-assisted 
continuous evolution selection that rapidly evolves high-affinity protein-protein
interactions, and applied this system to evolve variants of the Bt toxin Cry1Ac
that bind a cadherin-like receptor from the insect pest Trichoplusia ni (TnCAD)
that is not natively bound by wild-type Cry1Ac. The resulting evolved Cry1Ac
variants bind TnCAD with high affinity (dissociation constant Kd = 11-41 nM),
kill TnCAD-expressing insect cells that are not susceptible to wild-type Cry1Ac, 
and kill Cry1Ac-resistant T. ni insects up to 335-fold more potently than
wild-type Cry1Ac. Our findings establish that the evolution of Bt toxins with
novel insect cell receptor affinity can overcome insect Bt toxin resistance and
confer lethality approaching that of the wild-type Bt toxin against non-resistant
insects.

Principles underlying sensory map topography in primary visual cortex.

Optometry, 33 West 42nd Street, New York, New York 10036, USA.

The primary visual cortex contains a detailed map of the visual scene, which is
represented according to multiple stimulus dimensions including spatial location,
ocular dominance and stimulus orientation. The maps for spatial location and
ocular dominance arise from the spatial arrangement of thalamic afferent axons in
the cortex. However, the origins of the other maps remain unclear. Here we show
that the cortical maps for orientation, direction and retinal disparity in the
cat (Felis catus) are all strongly related to the organization of the map for
spatial location of light (ON) and dark (OFF) stimuli, an organization that we
show is OFF-dominated, OFF-centric and runs orthogonal to ocular dominance
columns. Because this ON-OFF organization originates from the clustering of ON
and OFF thalamic afferents in the visual cortex, we conclude that all main
features of visual cortical topography, including orientation, direction and
retinal disparity, follow a common organizing principle that arranges thalamic
axons with similar retinotopy and ON-OFF polarity in neighbouring cortical
regions.

architecture.

Circuits in the visual cortex integrate the information derived from separate ON 
(light-responsive) and OFF (dark-responsive) pathways to construct orderly
columnar representations of stimulus orientation and visual space. How this
transformation is achieved to meet the specific topographic constraints of each
representation remains unclear. Here we report several novel features of ON-OFF
convergence visualized by mapping the receptive fields of layer 2/3 neurons in
the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) visual cortex using two-photon imaging of
GCaMP6 calcium signals. We show that the spatially separate ON and OFF subfields 
of simple cells in layer 2/3 exhibit topologically distinct relationships with
the maps of visual space and orientation preference. The centres of OFF subfields
for neurons in a given region of cortex are confined to a compact region of
visual space and display a smooth visuotopic progression. By contrast, the
centres of the ON subfields are distributed over a wider region of visual space, 
display substantial visuotopic scatter, and have an orientation-specific
displacement consistent with orientation preference map structure. As a result,
cortical columns exhibit an invariant aggregate receptive field structure: an
OFF-dominated central region flanked by ON-dominated subfields. This distinct
arrangement of ON and OFF inputs enables continuity in the mapping of both
orientation and visual space and the generation of a columnar map of absolute
spatial phase.

The bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system allows sequence-specific gene editing in many
organisms and holds promise as a tool to generate models of human diseases, for
example, in human pluripotent stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9 introduces targeted
double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with high efficiency, which are typically repaired 
by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) resulting in nonspecific insertions,
deletions or other mutations (indels). DSBs may also be repaired by
homology-directed repair (HDR) using a DNA repair template, such as an introduced
single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotide (ssODN), allowing knock-in of specific
mutations. Although CRISPR/Cas9 is used extensively to engineer gene knockouts
through NHEJ, editing by HDR remains inefficient and can be corrupted by
additional indels, preventing its widespread use for modelling genetic disorders 
through introducing disease-associated mutations. Furthermore, targeted
mutational knock-in at single alleles to model diseases caused by heterozygous
mutations has not been reported. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based
genome-editing framework that allows selective introduction of mono- and
bi-allelic sequence changes with high efficiency and accuracy. We show that HDR
accuracy is increased dramatically by incorporating silent CRISPR/Cas-blocking
mutations along with pathogenic mutations, and establish a method termed
'CORRECT' for scarless genome editing. By characterizing and exploiting a
stereotyped inverse relationship between a mutation's incorporation rate and its 
distance to the DSB, we achieve predictable control of zygosity. Homozygous
introduction requires a guide RNA targeting close to the intended mutation,
whereas heterozygous introduction can be accomplished by distance-dependent
suboptimal mutation incorporation or by use of mixed repair templates. Using this
approach, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells with heterozygous and
homozygous dominant early onset Alzheimer's disease-causing mutations in amyloid 
precursor protein (APP(Swe)) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1(M146V)) and derived cortical
neurons, which displayed genotype-dependent disease-associated phenotypes. Our
findings enable efficient introduction of specific sequence changes with
CRISPR/Cas9, facilitating study of human disease.

Resolved atomic lines reveal outflows in two ultraluminous X-ray sources.

0HA, UK.

Ultraluminous X-ray sources are extragalactic, off-nucleus, point sources in
galaxies, and have X-ray luminosities in excess of 3 × 10(39) ergs per second.
They are thought to be powered by accretion onto a compact object. Possible
explanations include accretion onto neutron stars with strong magnetic fields,
onto stellar-mass black holes (of up to 20 solar masses) at or in excess of the
classical Eddington limit, or onto intermediate-mass black holes (10(3)-10(5)
solar masses). The lack of sufficient energy resolution in previous analyses has 
prevented an unambiguous identification of any emission or absorption lines in
the X-ray band, thereby precluding a detailed analysis of the accretion flow.
Here we report the presence of X-ray emission lines arising from highly ionized
iron, oxygen and neon with a cumulative significance in excess of five standard
deviations, together with blueshifted (about 0.2 times light velocity) absorption
lines of similar significance, in the high-resolution X-ray spectra of the
ultraluminous X-ray sources NGC 1313 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1. The blueshifted
absorption lines must occur in a fast-outflowing gas, whereas the emission lines 
originate in slow-moving gas around the source. We conclude that the compact
object in each source is surrounded by powerful winds with an outflow velocity of
about 0.2 times that of light, as predicted by models of accreting supermassive
black holes and hyper-accreting stellar-mass black holes.

Despite the success of potent anti-retroviral drugs in controlling human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, little progress has been made in
generating an effective HIV-1 vaccine. Although passive transfer of anti-HIV-1
broadly neutralizing antibodies can protect mice or macaques against a single
high-dose challenge with HIV or simian/human (SIV/HIV) chimaeric viruses (SHIVs) 
respectively, the long-term efficacy of a passive antibody transfer approach for 
HIV-1 has not been examined. Here we show, on the basis of the relatively
long-term protection conferred by hepatitis A immune globulin, the efficacy of a 
single injection (20 mg kg(-1)) of four anti-HIV-1-neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies (VRC01, VRC01-LS, 3BNC117, and 10-1074 (refs 9 - 12)) in blocking
repeated weekly low-dose virus challenges of the clade B SHIVAD8. Compared with
control animals, which required two to six challenges (median = 3) for infection,
a single broadly neutralizing antibody infusion prevented virus acquisition for
up to 23 weekly challenges. This effect depended on antibody potency and
half-life. The highest levels of plasma-neutralizing activity and,
correspondingly, the longest protection were found in monkeys administered the
more potent antibodies 3BNC117 and 10-1074 (median = 13 and 12.5 weeks,
respectively). VRC01, which showed lower plasma-neutralizing activity, protected 
for a shorter time (median = 8 weeks). The introduction of a mutation that
extends antibody half-life into the crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain of VRC01 
increased median protection from 8 to 14.5 weeks. If administered to populations 
at high risk of HIV-1 transmission, such an immunoprophylaxis regimen could have 
a major impact on virus transmission.

Noble gas isotopes are powerful tracers of the origins of planetary volatiles,
and the accretion and evolution of the Earth. The compositions of magmatic gases 
provide insights into the evolution of the Earth's mantle and atmosphere. Despite
recent analytical progress in the study of planetary materials and mantle-derived
gases, the possible dual origin of the planetary gases in the mantle and the
atmosphere remains unconstrained. Evidence relating to the relationship between
the volatiles within our planet and the potential cosmochemical end-members is
scarce. Here we show, using high-precision analysis of magmatic gas from the
Eifel volcanic area (in Germany), that the light xenon isotopes identify a
chondritic primordial component that differs from the precursor of atmospheric
xenon. This is consistent with an asteroidal origin for the volatiles in the
Earth's mantle, and indicates that the volatiles in the atmosphere and mantle
originated from distinct cosmochemical sources. Furthermore, our data are
consistent with the origin of Eifel magmatism being a deep mantle plume. The
corresponding mantle source has been isolated from the convective mantle since
about 4.45 billion years ago, in agreement with models that predict the early
isolation of mantle domains. Xenon isotope systematics support a clear
distinction between mid-ocean-ridge and continental or oceanic plume sources,
with chemical heterogeneities dating back to the Earth's accretion. The deep
reservoir now sampled by the Eifel gas had a lower volatile/refractory
(iodine/plutonium) composition than the shallower mantle sampled by
mid-ocean-ridge volcanism, highlighting the increasing contribution of
volatile-rich material during the first tens of millions of years of terrestrial 
accretion.

The evolution of novel cell types led to the emergence of new tissues and organs 
during the diversification of animals. The origin of the chondrocyte, the cell
type that synthesizes cartilage matrix, was central to the evolution of the
vertebrate endoskeleton. Cartilage-like tissues also exist outside the
vertebrates, although their relationship to vertebrate cartilage is enigmatic.
Here we show that protostome and deuterostome cartilage share structural and
chemical properties, and that the mechanisms of cartilage development are
extensively conserved--from induction of chondroprogenitor cells by Hedgehog and 
β-catenin signalling, to chondrocyte differentiation and matrix synthesis by SoxE
and SoxD regulation of clade A fibrillar collagen (ColA) genes--suggesting that
the chondrogenic gene regulatory network evolved in the common ancestor of
Bilateria. These results reveal deep homology of the genetic program for
cartilage development in Bilateria and suggest that activation of this ancient
core chondrogenic network underlies the parallel evolution of cartilage tissues
in Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa and Deuterostomia.

New methods and strategies for the direct functionalization of C-H bonds are
beginning to reshape the field of retrosynthetic analysis, affecting the
synthesis of natural products, medicines and materials. The oxidation of allylic 
systems has played a prominent role in this context as possibly the most widely
applied C-H functionalization, owing to the utility of enones and allylic
alcohols as versatile intermediates, and their prevalence in natural and
unnatural materials. Allylic oxidations have featured in hundreds of syntheses,
including some natural product syntheses regarded as "classics". Despite many
attempts to improve the efficiency and practicality of this transformation, the
majority of conditions still use highly toxic reagents (based around toxic
elements such as chromium or selenium) or expensive catalysts (such as palladium 
or rhodium). These requirements are problematic in industrial settings;
currently, no scalable and sustainable solution to allylic oxidation exists. This
oxidation strategy is therefore rarely used for large-scale synthetic
applications, limiting the adoption of this retrosynthetic strategy by industrial
scientists. Here we describe an electrochemical C-H oxidation strategy that
exhibits broad substrate scope, operational simplicity and high chemoselectivity.
It uses inexpensive and readily available materials, and represents a scalable
allylic C-H oxidation (demonstrated on 100 grams), enabling the adoption of this 
C-H oxidation strategy in large-scale industrial settings without substantial
environmental impact.

Gauss's law dictates that the net electric field inside a conductor in
electrostatic equilibrium is zero by effective charge screening; free carriers
within a metal eliminate internal dipoles that may arise owing to asymmetric
charge distributions. Quantum physics supports this view, demonstrating that
delocalized electrons make a static macroscopic polarization, an ill-defined
quantity in metals--it is exceedingly unusual to find a polar metal that exhibits
long-range ordered dipoles owing to cooperative atomic displacements aligned from
dipolar interactions as in insulating phases. Here we describe the quantum
mechanical design and experimental realization of room-temperature polar metals
in thin-film ANiO3 perovskite nickelates using a strategy based on atomic-scale
control of inversion-preserving (centric) displacements. We predict with ab
initio calculations that cooperative polar A cation displacements are
geometrically stabilized with a non-equilibrium amplitude and tilt pattern of the
corner-connected NiO6 octahedral--the structural signatures of perovskites--owing
to geometric constraints imposed by the underlying substrate. Heteroepitaxial
thin-films grown on LaAlO3 (111) substrates fulfil the design principles. We
achieve both a conducting polar monoclinic oxide that is inaccessible in
compositionally identical films grown on (001) substrates, and observe a hidden, 
previously unreported, non-equilibrium structure in thin-film geometries. We
expect that the geometric stabilization approach will provide novel avenues for
realizing new multifunctional materials with unusual coexisting properties.

Defects in clearance of dying cells have been proposed to underlie the
pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mice lacking molecules
associated with dying cell clearance develop SLE-like disease, and phagocytes
from patients with SLE often display defective clearance and increased
inflammatory cytokine production when exposed to dying cells in vitro.
Previously, we and others described a form of noncanonical autophagy known as
LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), in which phagosomes containing engulfed
particles, including dying cells, recruit elements of the autophagy pathway to
facilitate maturation of phagosomes and digestion of their contents. Genome-wide 
association studies have identified polymorphisms in the Atg5 (ref. 8) and
possibly Atg7 (ref. 9) genes, involved in both canonical autophagy and LAP, as
markers of a predisposition for SLE. Here we describe the consequences of
defective LAP in vivo. Mice lacking any of several components of the LAP pathway 
show increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies,
glomerular immune complex deposition, and evidence of kidney damage. When dying
cells are injected into LAP-deficient mice, they are engulfed but not efficiently
degraded and trigger acute elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines but not
anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10. Repeated injection of dying cells into
LAP-deficient, but not LAP-sufficient, mice accelerated the development of
SLE-like disease, including increased serum levels of autoantibodies. By
contrast, mice deficient in genes required for canonical autophagy but not LAP do
not display defective dying cell clearance, inflammatory cytokine production, or 
SLE-like disease, and, like wild-type mice, produce IL-10 in response to dying
cells. Therefore, defects in LAP, rather than canonical autophagy, can cause
SLE-like phenomena, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants 
associated with complex diseases, but mechanistic insights are impeded by a lack 
of understanding of how specific risk variants functionally contribute to the
underlying pathogenesis. It has been proposed that cis-acting effects of
non-coding risk variants on gene expression are a major factor for phenotypic
variation of complex traits and disease susceptibility. Recent genome-scale
epigenetic studies have highlighted the enrichment of GWAS-identified variants in
regulatory DNA elements of disease-relevant cell types. Furthermore, single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific changes in transcription factor binding
are correlated with heritable alterations in chromatin state and considered a
major mediator of sequence-dependent regulation of gene expression. Here we
describe a novel strategy to functionally dissect the cis-acting effect of
genetic risk variants in regulatory elements on gene expression by combining
genome-wide epigenetic information with clustered regularly-interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells.
By generating a genetically precisely controlled experimental system, we identify
a common Parkinson's disease associated risk variant in a non-coding distal
enhancer element that regulates the expression of α-synuclein (SNCA), a key gene 
implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Our data suggest that the 
transcriptional deregulation of SNCA is associated with sequence-dependent
binding of the brain-specific transcription factors EMX2 and NKX6-1. This work
establishes an experimental paradigm to functionally connect genetic variation
with disease-relevant phenotypes.

Signalling by ubiquitination regulates virtually every cellular process in
eukaryotes. Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a substrate is catalysed by the
E1, E2 and E3 three-enzyme cascade, which links the carboxy terminus of ubiquitin
to the ε-amino group of, in most cases, a lysine of the substrate via an
isopeptide bond. Given the essential roles of ubiquitination in the regulation of
the immune system, it is not surprising that the ubiquitination network is a
common target for diverse infectious agents. For example, many bacterial
pathogens exploit ubiquitin signalling using virulence factors that function as
E3 ligases, deubiquitinases or as enzymes that directly attack ubiquitin. The
bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila utilizes approximately 300 effectors
that modulate diverse host processes to create a permissive niche for its
replication in phagocytes. Here we demonstrate that members of the SidE effector 
family of L. pneumophila ubiquitinate multiple Rab small GTPases associated with 
the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, we show that these proteins are capable of
catalysing ubiquitination without the need for the E1 and E2 enzymes. A putative 
mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase motif critical for the ubiquitination activity is
also essential for the role of the SidE family in intracellular bacterial
replication in a protozoan host. The E1/E2-independent ubiquitination catalysed
by these enzymes is energized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which
activates ubiquitin by the formation of ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin. These results 
establish that ubiquitination can be catalysed by a single enzyme, the activity
of which does not require ATP.

Umbilical cord blood-derived haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are essential for
many life-saving regenerative therapies. However, despite their advantages for
transplantation, their clinical use is restricted because HSCs in cord blood are 
found only in small numbers. Small molecules that enhance haematopoietic stem and
progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in culture have been identified, but in many
cases their mechanisms of action or the nature of the pathways they impinge on
are poorly understood. A greater understanding of the molecular circuitry that
underpins the self-renewal of human HSCs will facilitate the development of
targeted strategies that expand HSCs for regenerative therapies. Whereas
transcription factor networks have been shown to influence the self-renewal and
lineage decisions of human HSCs, the post-transcriptional mechanisms that guide
HSC fate have not been closely investigated. Here we show that overexpression of 
the RNA-binding protein Musashi-2 (MSI2) induces multiple pro-self-renewal
phenotypes, including a 17-fold increase in short-term repopulating cells and a
net 23-fold ex vivo expansion of long-term repopulating HSCs. By performing a
global analysis of MSI2-RNA interactions, we show that MSI2 directly attenuates
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signalling through post-transcriptional
downregulation of canonical AHR pathway components in cord blood HSPCs. Our study
gives mechanistic insight into RNA networks controlled by RNA-binding proteins
that underlie self-renewal and provides evidence that manipulating such networks 
ex vivo can enhance the regenerative potential of human HSCs.

The regulation of water content in polymeric membranes is important in a number
of applications, such as reverse electrodialysis and proton-exchange fuel-cell
membranes. External thermal and water management systems add both mass and size
to systems, and so intrinsic mechanisms of retaining water and maintaining ionic 
transport in such membranes are particularly important for applications where
small system size is important. For example, in proton-exchange membrane fuel
cells, where water retention in the membrane is crucial for efficient transport
of hydrated ions, by operating the cells at higher temperatures without external 
humidification, the membrane is self-humidified with water generated by
electrochemical reactions. Here we report an alternative solution that does not
rely on external regulation of water supply or high temperatures. Water content
in hydrocarbon polymer membranes is regulated through nanometre-scale cracks
('nanocracks') in a hydrophobic surface coating. These cracks work as nanoscale
valves to retard water desorption and to maintain ion conductivity in the
membrane on dehumidification. Hydrocarbon fuel-cell membranes with surface
nanocrack coatings operated at intermediate temperatures show improved
electrochemical performance, and coated reverse-electrodialysis membranes show
enhanced ionic selectivity with low bulk resistance.

Imperfect knowledge of the times at which 'snapshots' of a system are recorded
degrades our ability to recover dynamical information, and can scramble the
sequence of events. In X-ray free-electron lasers, for example, the
uncertainty--the so-called timing jitter--between the arrival of an optical
trigger ('pump') pulse and a probing X-ray pulse can exceed the length of the
X-ray pulse by up to two orders of magnitude, marring the otherwise precise
time-resolution capabilities of this class of instruments. The widespread notion 
that little dynamical information is available on timescales shorter than the
timing uncertainty has led to various hardware schemes to reduce timing
uncertainty. These schemes are expensive, tend to be specific to one experimental
approach and cannot be used when the record was created under ill-defined or
uncontrolled conditions such as during geological events. Here we present a
data-analytical approach, based on singular-value decomposition and nonlinear
Laplacian spectral analysis, that can recover the history and dynamics of a
system from a dense collection of noisy snapshots spanning a sufficiently large
multiple of the timing uncertainty. The power of the algorithm is demonstrated by
extracting the underlying dynamics on the few-femtosecond timescale from noisy
experimental X-ray free-electron laser data recorded with 300-femtosecond timing 
uncertainty. Using a noisy dataset from a pump-probe experiment on the Coulomb
explosion of nitrogen molecules, our analysis reveals vibrational wave-packets
consisting of components with periods as short as 15 femtoseconds, as well as
more rapid changes, which have yet to be fully explored. Our approach can
potentially be applied whenever dynamical or historical information is tainted by
timing uncertainty.

The meaning of language is represented in regions of the cerebral cortex
collectively known as the 'semantic system'. However, little of the semantic
system has been mapped comprehensively, and the semantic selectivity of most
regions is unknown. Here we systematically map semantic selectivity across the
cortex using voxel-wise modelling of functional MRI (fMRI) data collected while
subjects listened to hours of narrative stories. We show that the semantic system
is organized into intricate patterns that seem to be consistent across
individuals. We then use a novel generative model to create a detailed semantic
atlas. Our results suggest that most areas within the semantic system represent
information about specific semantic domains, or groups of related concepts, and
our atlas shows which domains are represented in each area. This study
demonstrates that data-driven methods--commonplace in studies of human
neuroanatomy and functional connectivity--provide a powerful and efficient means 
for mapping functional representations in the brain.

Planktonic organisms play crucial roles in oceanic food webs and global
biogeochemical cycles. Most of our knowledge about the ecological impact of large
zooplankton stems from research on abundant and robust crustaceans, and in
particular copepods. A number of the other organisms that comprise planktonic
communities are fragile, and therefore hard to sample and quantify, meaning that 
their abundances and effects on oceanic ecosystems are poorly understood. Here,
using data from a worldwide in situ imaging survey of plankton larger than
600 μm, we show that a substantial part of the biomass of this size fraction
consists of giant protists belonging to the Rhizaria, a super-group of mostly
fragile unicellular marine organisms that includes the taxa Phaeodaria and
Radiolaria (for example, orders Collodaria and Acantharia). Globally, we estimate
that rhizarians in the top 200 m of world oceans represent a standing stock of
0.089 Pg carbon, equivalent to 5.2% of the total oceanic biota carbon reservoir. 
In the vast oligotrophic intertropical open oceans, rhizarian biomass is
estimated to be equivalent to that of all other mesozooplankton (plankton in the 
size range 0.2-20 mm). The photosymbiotic association of many rhizarians with
microalgae may be an important factor in explaining their distribution. The
previously overlooked importance of these giant protists across the widest
ecosystem on the planet changes our understanding of marine planktonic
ecosystems.

The CRISPR-Cas systems, as exemplified by CRISPR-Cas9, are RNA-guided adaptive
immune systems used by bacteria and archaea to defend against viral infection.
The CRISPR-Cpf1 system, a new class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, mediates robust DNA
interference in human cells. Although functionally conserved, Cpf1 and Cas9
differ in many aspects including their guide RNAs and substrate specificity. Here
we report the 2.38 Å crystal structure of the CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-bound
Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 Cpf1 (LbCpf1). LbCpf1 has a triangle-shaped
architecture with a large positively charged channel at the centre. Recognized by
the oligonucleotide-binding domain of LbCpf1, the crRNA adopts a highly distorted
conformation stabilized by extensive intramolecular interactions and the
(Mg(H2O)6)(2+) ion. The oligonucleotide-binding domain also harbours a looped-out
helical domain that is important for LbCpf1 substrate binding. Binding of crRNA
or crRNA lacking the guide sequence induces marked conformational changes but no 
oligomerization of LbCpf1. Our study reveals the crRNA recognition mechanism and 
provides insight into crRNA-guided substrate binding of LbCpf1, establishing a
framework for engineering LbCpf1 to improve its efficiency and specificity for
genome editing.

CRISPR-Cas systems that provide defence against mobile genetic elements in
bacteria and archaea have evolved a variety of mechanisms to target and cleave
RNA or DNA. The well-studied types I, II and III utilize a set of distinct
CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins for production of mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs)
and interference with invading nucleic acids. In types I and III, Cas6 or Cas5d
cleaves precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA) and the mature crRNAs then guide a complex of
Cas proteins (Cascade-Cas3, type I; Csm or Cmr, type III) to target and cleave
invading DNA or RNA. In type II systems, RNase III cleaves pre-crRNA base-paired 
with trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) in the presence of Cas9 (refs 13, 14). The
mature tracrRNA-crRNA duplex then guides Cas9 to cleave target DNA. Here, we
demonstrate a novel mechanism in CRISPR-Cas immunity. We show that type V-A Cpf1 
from Francisella novicida is a dual-nuclease that is specific to crRNA biogenesis
and target DNA interference. Cpf1 cleaves pre-crRNA upstream of a hairpin
structure formed within the CRISPR repeats and thereby generates intermediate
crRNAs that are processed further, leading to mature crRNAs. After recognition of
a 5'-YTN-3' protospacer adjacent motif on the non-target DNA strand and
subsequent probing for an eight-nucleotide seed sequence, Cpf1, guided by the
single mature repeat-spacer crRNA, introduces double-stranded breaks in the
target DNA to generate a 5' overhang. The RNase and DNase activities of Cpf1
require sequence- and structure-specific binding to the hairpin of crRNA repeats.
Cpf1 uses distinct active domains for both nuclease reactions and cleaves nucleic
acids in the presence of magnesium or calcium. This study uncovers a new family
of enzymes with specific dual endoribonuclease and endonuclease activities, and
demonstrates that type V-A constitutes the most minimalistic of the CRISPR-Cas
systems so far described.

Our current understanding of immunology was largely defined in laboratory mice,
partly because they are inbred and genetically homogeneous, can be genetically
manipulated, allow kinetic tissue analyses to be carried out from the onset of
disease, and permit the use of tractable disease models. Comparably reductionist 
experiments are neither technically nor ethically possible in humans. However,
there is growing concern that laboratory mice do not reflect relevant aspects of 
the human immune system, which may account for failures to translate disease
treatments from bench to bedside. Laboratory mice live in abnormally hygienic
specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier facilities. Here we show that standard
laboratory mouse husbandry has profound effects on the immune system and that
environmental changes produce mice with immune systems closer to those of adult
humans. Laboratory mice--like newborn, but not adult, humans--lack
effector-differentiated and mucosally distributed memory T cells. These cell
populations were present in free-living barn populations of feral mice and pet
store mice with diverse microbial experience, and were induced in laboratory mice
after co-housing with pet store mice, suggesting that the environment is involved
in the induction of these cells. Altering the living conditions of mice
profoundly affected the cellular composition of the innate and adaptive immune
systems, resulted in global changes in blood cell gene expression to patterns
that more closely reflected the immune signatures of adult humans rather than
neonates, altered resistance to infection, and influenced T-cell differentiation 
in response to a de novo viral infection. These data highlight the effects of
environment on the basal immune state and response to infection and suggest that 
restoring physiological microbial exposure in laboratory mice could provide a
relevant tool for modelling immunological events in free-living organisms,
including humans.

In the classic Diels-Alder [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction, the overall degree of 
unsaturation (or oxidation state) of the 4π (diene) and 2π (dienophile) pairs of 
reactants dictates the oxidation state of the newly formed six-membered
carbocycle. For example, in the classic Diels-Alder reaction, butadiene and
ethylene combine to produce cyclohexene. More recent developments include
variants in which the number of hydrogen atoms in the reactant pair and in the
resulting product is reduced by, for example, four in the
tetradehydro-Diels-Alder (TDDA) and by six in the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) 
reactions. Any oxidation state higher than tetradehydro (that is, lacking more
than four hydrogens) leads to the production of a reactive intermediate that is
more highly oxidized than benzene. This increases the power of the overall
process substantially, because trapping of the reactive intermediate can be used 
to increase the structural complexity of the final product in a controllable and 
versatile manner. Here we report an unprecedented overall 4π + 2π cycloaddition
reaction that generates a different, highly reactive intermediate known as an
α,3-dehydrotoluene. This species is in the same oxidation state as a benzyne.
Like benzynes, α,3-dehydrotoluenes can be captured by various trapping agents to 
produce structurally diverse products that are complementary to those arising
from the HDDA process. We call this new cycloisomerization process a
pentadehydro-Diels-Alder (PDDA) reaction-a nomenclature chosen for chemical
taxonomic reasons rather than mechanistic ones. In addition to alkynes, nitriles 
(RC≡N), although non-participants in aza-HDDA reactions, readily function as the 
2π component in PDDA cyclizations to produce, via trapping of the
α,3-(5-aza)dehydrotoluene intermediates, pyridine-containing products.

Tullimonstrum gregarium is an iconic soft-bodied fossil from the Carboniferous
Mazon Creek Lagerstätte (Illinois, USA). Despite a large number of specimens and 
distinct anatomy, various analyses over the past five decades have failed to
determine the phylogenetic affinities of the 'Tully monster', and although it has
been allied to such disparate phyla as the Mollusca, Annelida or Chordata, it
remains enigmatic. The nature and phylogenetic affinities of Tullimonstrum have
defied confident systematic placement because none of its preserved anatomy
provides unequivocal evidence of homology, without which comparative analysis
fails. Here we show that the eyes of Tullimonstrum possess ultrastructural
details indicating homology with vertebrate eyes. Anatomical analysis using
scanning electron microscopy reveals that the eyes of Tullimonstrum preserve a
retina defined by a thick sheet comprising distinct layers of spheroidal and
cylindrical melanosomes. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and
multivariate statistics provide further evidence that these microbodies are
melanosomes. A range of animals have melanin in their eyes, but the possession of
melanosomes of two distinct morphologies arranged in layers, forming retinal
pigment epithelium, is a synapomorphy of vertebrates. Our analysis indicates that
in addition to evidence of colour patterning, ecology and thermoregulation,
fossil melanosomes can also carry a phylogenetic signal. Identification in
Tullimonstrum of spheroidal and cylindrical melanosomes forming the remains of
retinal pigment epithelium indicates that it is a vertebrate; considering its
body parts in this new light suggests it was an anatomically unusual member of
total group Vertebrata.

Volcanic eruptions transfer huge amounts of gas to the atmosphere. In particular,
the sulfur released during large silicic explosive eruptions can induce global
cooling. A fundamental goal in volcanology, therefore, is to assess the potential
for eruption of the large volumes of crystal-poor, silicic magma that are stored 
at shallow depths in the crust, and to obtain theoretical bounds for the amount
of volatiles that can be released during these eruptions. It is puzzling that
highly evolved, crystal-poor silicic magmas are more likely to generate volcanic 
rocks than plutonic rocks. This observation suggests that such magmas are more
prone to erupting than are their crystal-rich counterparts. Moreover, well
studied examples of largely crystal-poor eruptions (for example, Katmai, Taupo
and Minoan) often exhibit a release of sulfur that is 10 to 20 times higher than 
the amount of sulfur estimated to be stored in the melt. Here we argue that these
two observations rest on how the magmatic volatile phase (MVP) behaves as it
rises buoyantly in zoned magma reservoirs. By investigating the fluid dynamics
that controls the transport of the MVP in crystal-rich and crystal-poor magmas,
we show how the interplay between capillary stresses and the viscosity contrast
between the MVP and the host melt results in a counterintuitive dynamics, whereby
the MVP tends to migrate efficiently in crystal-rich parts of a magma reservoir
and accumulate in crystal-poor regions. The accumulation of low-density bubbles
of MVP in crystal-poor magmas has implications for the eruptive potential of such
magmas, and is the likely source of the excess sulfur released during explosive
eruptions.

Neural activity maintains representations that bridge past and future events,
often over many seconds. Network models can produce persistent and ramping
activity, but the positive feedback that is critical for these slow dynamics can 
cause sensitivity to perturbations. Here we use electrophysiology and optogenetic
perturbations in the mouse premotor cortex to probe the robustness of persistent 
neural representations during motor planning. We show that preparatory activity
is remarkably robust to large-scale unilateral silencing: detailed neural
dynamics that drive specific future movements were quickly and selectively
restored by the network. Selectivity did not recover after bilateral silencing of
the premotor cortex. Perturbations to one hemisphere are thus corrected by
information from the other hemisphere. Corpus callosum bisections demonstrated
that premotor cortex hemispheres can maintain preparatory activity independently.
Redundancy across selectively coupled modules, as we observed in the premotor
cortex, is a hallmark of robust control systems. Network models incorporating
these principles show robustness that is consistent with data.

Nitrogen oxides are essential for the formation of secondary atmospheric aerosols
and of atmospheric oxidants such as ozone and the hydroxyl radical, which
controls the self-cleansing capacity of the atmosphere. Nitric acid, a major
oxidation product of nitrogen oxides, has traditionally been considered to be a
permanent sink of nitrogen oxides. However, model studies predict higher ratios
of nitric acid to nitrogen oxides in the troposphere than are observed. A
'renoxification' process that recycles nitric acid into nitrogen oxides has been 
proposed to reconcile observations with model studies, but the mechanisms
responsible for this process remain uncertain. Here we present data from an
aircraft measurement campaign over the North Atlantic Ocean and find evidence for
rapid recycling of nitric acid to nitrous acid and nitrogen oxides in the clean
marine boundary layer via particulate nitrate photolysis. Laboratory experiments 
further demonstrate the photolysis of particulate nitrate collected on filters at
a rate more than two orders of magnitude greater than that of gaseous nitric
acid, with nitrous acid as the main product. Box model calculations based on the 
Master Chemical Mechanism suggest that particulate nitrate photolysis mainly
sustains the observed levels of nitrous acid and nitrogen oxides at midday under 
typical marine boundary layer conditions. Given that oceans account for more than
70 per cent of Earth's surface, we propose that particulate nitrate photolysis
could be a substantial tropospheric nitrogen oxide source. Recycling of nitrogen 
oxides in remote oceanic regions with minimal direct nitrogen oxide emissions
could increase the formation of tropospheric oxidants and secondary atmospheric
aerosols on a global scale.

Insights into complex phenomena in quantum matter can be gained from simulation
experiments with ultracold atoms, especially in cases where theoretical
characterization is challenging. However, these experiments are mostly limited to
short-range collisional interactions; recently observed perturbative effects of
long-range interactions were too weak to reach new quantum phases. Here we
experimentally realize a bosonic lattice model with competing short- and
long-range interactions, and observe the appearance of four distinct quantum
phases--a superfluid, a supersolid, a Mott insulator and a charge density wave.
Our system is based on an atomic quantum gas trapped in an optical lattice inside
a high-finesse optical cavity. The strength of the short-range on-site
interactions is controlled by means of the optical lattice depth. The long
(infinite)-range interaction potential is mediated by a vacuum mode of the cavity
and is independently controlled by tuning the cavity resonance. When probing the 
phase transition between the Mott insulator and the charge density wave in real
time, we observed a behaviour characteristic of a first-order phase transition.
Our measurements have accessed a regime for quantum simulation of many-body
systems where the physics is determined by the intricate competition between two 
different types of interactions and the zero point motion of the particles.

The human σ1 receptor is an enigmatic endoplasmic-reticulum-resident
transmembrane protein implicated in a variety of disorders including depression, 
drug addiction, and neuropathic pain. Recently, an additional connection to
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has emerged from studies of human genetics and
mouse models. Unlike many transmembrane receptors that belong to large,
extensively studied families such as G-protein-coupled receptors or ligand-gated 
ion channels, the σ1 receptor is an evolutionary isolate with no discernible
similarity to any other human protein. Despite its increasingly clear importance 
in human physiology and disease, the molecular architecture of the σ1 receptor
and its regulation by drug-like compounds remain poorly defined. Here we report
crystal structures of the human σ1 receptor in complex with two chemically
divergent ligands, PD144418 and 4-IBP. The structures reveal a trimeric
architecture with a single transmembrane domain in each protomer. The
carboxy-terminal domain of the receptor shows an extensive flat, hydrophobic
membrane-proximal surface, suggesting an intimate association with the cytosolic 
surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in cells. This domain includes a
cupin-like β-barrel with the ligand-binding site buried at its centre. This
large, hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity shows remarkable plasticity in ligand
recognition, binding the two ligands in similar positions despite dissimilar
chemical structures. Taken together, these results reveal the overall
architecture, oligomerization state, and molecular basis for ligand recognition
by this important but poorly understood protein.

Problematic fossils, extinct taxa of enigmatic morphology that cannot be assigned
to a known major group, were once a major issue in palaeontology. A long-favoured
solution to the 'problem of the problematica', particularly the 'weird wonders'
of the Cambrian Burgess Shale, was to consider them representatives of extinct
phyla. A combination of new evidence and modern approaches to phylogenetic
analysis has now resolved the affinities of most of these forms. Perhaps the most
notable exception is Tullimonstrum gregarium, popularly known as the Tully
monster, a large soft-bodied organism from the late Carboniferous Mazon Creek
biota (approximately 309-307 million years ago) of Illinois, USA, which was
designated the official state fossil of Illinois in 1989. Its phylogenetic
position has remained uncertain and it has been compared with nemerteans,
polychaetes, gastropods, conodonts, and the stem arthropod Opabinia. Here we
review the morphology of Tullimonstrum based on an analysis of more than 1,200
specimens. We find that the anterior proboscis ends in a buccal apparatus
containing teeth, the eyes project laterally on a long rigid bar, and the
elongate segmented body bears a caudal fin with dorsal and ventral lobes. We
describe new evidence for a notochord, cartilaginous arcualia, gill pouches,
articulations within the proboscis, and multiple tooth rows adjacent to the
mouth. This combination of characters, supported by phylogenetic analysis,
identifies Tullimonstrum as a vertebrate, and places it on the stem lineage to
lampreys (Petromyzontida). In addition to increasing the known morphological
disparity of extinct lampreys, a chordate affinity for T. gregarium resolves the 
nature of a soft-bodied fossil which has been debated for more than 50 years.

The biological carbon pump is the process by which CO2 is transformed to organic 
carbon via photosynthesis, exported through sinking particles, and finally
sequestered in the deep ocean. While the intensity of the pump correlates with
plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the
process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and
metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our
understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific
plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate
with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and 
alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most 
strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted,
oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few
bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability
in carbon export in these regions.

Recent improvement and projected worsening of weather in the United States.

Egan PJ, Mullin M.

Comment in
    Nature. 2016 Apr 21;532(7599):317-8.

As climate change unfolds, weather systems in the United States have been
shifting in patterns that vary across regions and seasons. Climate science
research typically assesses these changes by examining individual weather
indicators, such as temperature or precipitation, in isolation, and averaging
their values across the spatial surface. As a result, little is known about
population exposure to changes in weather and how people experience and evaluate 
these changes considered together. Here we show that in the United States from
1974 to 2013, the weather conditions experienced by the vast majority of the
population improved. Using previous research on how weather affects local
population growth to develop an index of people’s weather preferences, we find
that 80% of Americans live in counties that are experiencing more pleasant
weather than they did four decades ago. Virtually all Americans are now
experiencing the much milder winters that they typically prefer, and these mild
winters have not been offset by markedly more uncomfortable summers or other
negative changes. Climate change models predict that this trend is temporary,
however, because US summers will eventually warm more than winters. Under a
scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions proceed at an unabated rate
(Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), we estimate that 88% of the US public
will experience weather at the end of the century that is less preferable than
weather in the recent past. Our results have implications for the public’s
understanding of the climate change problem, which is shaped in part by
experiences with local weather. Whereas weather patterns in recent decades have
served as a poor source of motivation for Americans to demand a policy response
to climate change, public concern may rise once people’s everyday experiences of 
climate change effects start to become less pleasant.

Circadian clocks are fundamental to the biology of most eukaryotes, coordinating 
behaviour and physiology to resonate with the environmental cycle of day and
night through complex networks of clock-controlled genes. A fundamental knowledge
gap exists, however, between circadian gene expression cycles and the biochemical
mechanisms that ultimately facilitate circadian regulation of cell biology. Here 
we report circadian rhythms in the intracellular concentration of magnesium ions,
[Mg(2+)]i, which act as a cell-autonomous timekeeping component to determine key 
clock properties both in a human cell line and in a unicellular alga that
diverged from each other more than 1 billion years ago. Given the essential role 
of Mg(2+) as a cofactor for ATP, a functional consequence of [Mg(2+)]i
oscillations is dynamic regulation of cellular energy expenditure over the daily 
cycle. Mechanistically, we find that these rhythms provide bilateral feedback
linking rhythmic metabolism to clock-controlled gene expression. The global
regulation of nucleotide triphosphate turnover by intracellular Mg(2+)
availability has potential to impact upon many of the cell's more than 600
MgATP-dependent enzymes and every cellular system where MgNTP hydrolysis becomes 
rate limiting. Indeed, we find that circadian control of translation by mTOR is
regulated through [Mg(2+)]i oscillations. It will now be important to identify
which additional biological processes are subject to this form of regulation in
tissues of multicellular organisms such as plants and humans, in the context of
health and disease.

Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems insert spacers derived from
viruses and other parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci to provide
sequence-specific immunity. This frequently results in high within-population
spacer diversity, but it is unclear if and why this is important. Here we show
that, as a result of this spacer diversity, viruses can no longer evolve to
overcome CRISPR-Cas by point mutation, which results in rapid virus extinction.
This effect arises from synergy between spacer diversity and the high specificity
of infection, which greatly increases overall population resistance. We propose
that the resulting short-lived nature of CRISPR-dependent bacteria-virus
coevolution has provided strong selection for the evolution of sophisticated
virus-encoded anti-CRISPR mechanisms.

Bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) form a network of blood vessels that
regulate both leukocyte trafficking and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell
(HSPC) maintenance. However, it is not clear how BMECs balance these dual roles, 
and whether these events occur at the same vascular site. We found that mammalian
bone marrow stem cell maintenance and leukocyte trafficking are regulated by
distinct blood vessel types with different permeability properties. Less
permeable arterial blood vessels maintain haematopoietic stem cells in a low
reactive oxygen species (ROS) state, whereas the more permeable sinusoids promote
HSPC activation and are the exclusive site for immature and mature leukocyte
trafficking to and from the bone marrow. A functional consequence of high
permeability of blood vessels is that exposure to blood plasma increases bone
marrow HSPC ROS levels, augmenting their migration and differentiation, while
compromising their long-term repopulation and survival. These findings may have
relevance for clinical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and mobilization 
protocols.

Blood vessels define local microenvironments in the skeletal system, play crucial
roles in osteogenesis and provide niches for haematopoietic stem cells. The
properties of niche-forming vessels and their changes in the ageing organism
remain incompletely understood. Here we show that Notch signalling in endothelial
cells leads to the expansion of haematopoietic stem cell niches in bone, which
involves increases in CD31-positive capillaries and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ)-positive perivascular cells, arteriole formation and
elevated levels of cellular stem cell factor. Although endothelial
hypoxia-inducible factor signalling promotes some of these changes, it fails to
enhance vascular niche function because of a lack of arterialization and
expansion of PDGFRβ-positive cells. In ageing mice, niche-forming vessels in the 
skeletal system are strongly reduced but can be restored by activation of
endothelial Notch signalling. These findings indicate that vascular niches for
haematopoietic stem cells are part of complex, age-dependent microenvironments
involving multiple cell populations and vessel subtypes.

The quantum condensate of Cooper pairs forming a superconductor was originally
conceived as being translationally invariant. In theory, however, pairs can exist
with finite momentum Q, thus generating a state with a spatially modulated
Cooper-pair density. Such a state has been created in ultracold (6)Li gas but
never observed directly in any superconductor. It is now widely hypothesized that
the pseudogap phase of the copper oxide superconductors contains such a 'pair
density wave' state. Here we report the use of nanometre-resolution scanned
Josephson tunnelling microscopy to image Cooper pair tunnelling from a d-wave
superconducting microscope tip to the condensate of the superconductor
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. We demonstrate condensate visualization capabilities directly by
using the Cooper-pair density variations surrounding zinc impurity atoms and at
the Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x crystal supermodulation. Then, by using Fourier analysis of
scanned Josephson tunnelling images, we discover the direct signature of a
Cooper-pair density modulation at wavevectors QP ≈ (0.25, 0)2π/a0 and (0,
0.25)2π/a0 in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. The amplitude of these modulations is about five
per cent of the background condensate density and their form factor exhibits
primarily s or s' symmetry. This phenomenology is consistent with Ginzburg-Landau
theory when a charge density wave with d-symmetry form factor and wavevector
QC = QP coexists with a d-symmetry superconductor; it is also predicted by
several contemporary microscopic theories for the pseudogap phase.

USP14 is a major regulator of the proteasome and one of three
proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzymes. Its effects on protein turnover
are substrate-specific, for unknown reasons. We report that USP14 shows a marked 
preference for ubiquitin-cyclin B conjugates that carry more than one ubiquitin
modification or chain. This specificity is conserved from yeast to humans and is 
independent of chain linkage type. USP14 has been thought to cleave single
ubiquitin groups from the distal tip of a chain, but we find that it removes
chains from cyclin B en bloc, proceeding until a single chain remains. The
suppression of degradation by USP14's catalytic activity reflects its capacity to
act on a millisecond time scale, before the proteasome can initiate degradation
of the substrate. In addition, single-molecule studies showed that the dwell time
of ubiquitin conjugates at the proteasome was reduced by USP14-dependent
deubiquitination. In summary, the specificity of the proteasome can be regulated 
by rapid ubiquitin chain removal, which resolves substrates based on a novel
aspect of ubiquitin conjugate architecture.

Asymmetric cell division, the partitioning of cellular components in response to 
polarizing cues during mitosis, has roles in differentiation and development. It 
is important for the self-renewal of fertilized zygotes in Caenorhabditis elegans
and neuroblasts in Drosophila, and in the development of mammalian nervous and
digestive systems. T lymphocytes, upon activation by antigen-presenting cells
(APCs), can undergo asymmetric cell division, wherein the daughter cell proximal 
to the APC is more likely to differentiate into an effector-like T cell and the
distal daughter is more likely to differentiate into a memory-like T cell. Upon
activation and before cell division, expression of the transcription factor c-Myc
drives metabolic reprogramming, necessary for the subsequent proliferative burst.
Here we find that during the first division of an activated T cell in mice, c-Myc
can sort asymmetrically. Asymmetric distribution of amino acid transporters,
amino acid content, and activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) is correlated with c-Myc expression, and both amino acids and mTORC1
activity sustain the differences in c-Myc expression in one daughter cell
compared to the other. Asymmetric c-Myc levels in daughter T cells affect
proliferation, metabolism, and differentiation, and these effects are altered by 
experimental manipulation of mTORC1 activity or c-Myc expression. Therefore,
metabolic signalling pathways cooperate with transcription programs to maintain
differential cell fates following asymmetric T-cell division.

Adsorption-based phenomena are important in gas separations, such as the
treatment of greenhouse-gas and toxic-gas pollutants, and in
water-adsorption-based heat pumps for solar cooling systems. The ability to tune 
the pore size, shape and functionality of crystalline porous coordination
polymers--or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)--has made them attractive materials 
for such adsorption-based applications. The flexibility and
guest-molecule-dependent response of MOFs give rise to unexpected and often
desirable adsorption phenomena. Common to all isothermal gas adsorption
phenomena, however, is increased gas uptake with increased pressure. Here we
report adsorption transitions in the isotherms of a MOF (DUT-49) that exhibits a 
negative gas adsorption; that is, spontaneous desorption of gas (methane and
n-butane) occurs during pressure increase in a defined temperature and pressure
range. A combination of in situ powder X-ray diffraction, gas adsorption
experiments and simulations shows that this adsorption behaviour is controlled by
a sudden hysteretic structural deformation and pore contraction of the MOF, which
releases guest molecules. These findings may enable technologies using frameworks
capable of negative gas adsorption for pressure amplification in micro- and
macroscopic system engineering. Negative gas adsorption extends the series of
counterintuitive phenomena such as negative thermal expansion and negative
refractive indices and may be interpreted as an adsorptive analogue of
force-amplifying negative compressibility transitions proposed for metamaterials.

Quasars are associated with and powered by the accretion of material onto massive
black holes; the detection of highly luminous quasars with redshifts greater than
z = 6 suggests that black holes of up to ten billion solar masses already existed
13 billion years ago. Two possible present-day 'dormant' descendants of this
population of 'active' black holes have been found in the galaxies NGC 3842 and
NGC 4889 at the centres of the Leo and Coma galaxy clusters, which together form 
the central region of the Great Wall--the largest local structure of galaxies.
The most luminous quasars, however, are not confined to such high-density regions
of the early Universe; yet dormant black holes of this high mass have not yet
been found outside of modern-day rich clusters. Here we report observations of
the stellar velocity distribution in the galaxy NGC 1600--a relatively isolated
elliptical galaxy near the centre of a galaxy group at a distance of 64
megaparsecs from Earth. We use orbit superposition models to determine that the
black hole at the centre of NGC 1600 has a mass of 17 billion solar masses. The
spatial distribution of stars near the centre of NGC 1600 is rather diffuse. We
find that the region of depleted stellar density in the cores of massive
elliptical galaxies extends over the same radius as the gravitational sphere of
influence of the central black holes, and interpret this as the dynamical imprint
of the black holes.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonergic signalling through the
sodium- and chloride-dependent reuptake of neurotransmitter into presynaptic
neurons. SERT is a target for antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs, which
block reuptake and prolong neurotransmitter signalling. Here we report X-ray
crystallographic structures of human SERT at 3.15 Å resolution bound to the
antidepressants (S)-citalopram or paroxetine. Antidepressants lock SERT in an
outward-open conformation by lodging in the central binding site, located between
transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10, directly blocking serotonin binding. We 
further identify the location of an allosteric site in the complex as residing at
the periphery of the extracellular vestibule, interposed between extracellular
loops 4 and 6 and transmembrane helices 1, 6, 10 and 11. Occupancy of the
allosteric site sterically hinders ligand unbinding from the central site,
providing an explanation for the action of (S)-citalopram as an allosteric
ligand. These structures define the mechanism of antidepressant action in SERT,
and provide blueprints for future drug design.

The Parkfield tremors reveal slow and fast ruptures on the same asperity.

Technological University, 50 Nanyang Avenue, Singapore 639798, Singapore.

The deep extension of the San Andreas Fault is believed to be creeping, but the
recent observations of tectonic tremors from these depths indicate a complex
deformation style. In particular, an isolated tremor source near Parkfield has
been producing a sequence of low-frequency earthquakes that indicates an uncommon
mechanism of stress accumulation and release. The tremor pattern regularly
oscillated between three and six days from mid-2003 until it was disrupted by the
2004 magnitude 6.0 Parkfield earthquake. After that event, the tremor source
ruptured only about every three days, but over the next two years it gradually
returned to its initial alternating recurrence pattern. The mechanism that drives
this recurrence pattern is unknown. Here we use physics-based models to show that
the same tremor asperity--the region from which the low-frequency earthquakes
radiate--can regularly slip in slow and fast ruptures, naturally resulting in
recurrence intervals alternating between three and six days. This unusual slip
behaviour occurs when the tremor asperity size is close to the critical
nucleation size of earthquakes. We also show that changes in pore pressure
following the Parkfield earthquake can explain the sudden change and gradual
recovery of the recurrence intervals. Our findings suggest a framework for fault 
deformation in which the same asperity can release tectonic stress through both
slow and fast ruptures.

Homo floresiensis, a primitive hominin species discovered in Late Pleistocene
sediments at Liang Bua (Flores, Indonesia), has generated wide interest and
scientific debate. A major reason this taxon is controversial is because the H.
floresiensis-bearing deposits, which include associated stone artefacts and
remains of other extinct endemic fauna, were dated to between about 95 and 12
thousand calendar years (kyr) ago. These ages suggested that H. floresiensis
survived until long after modern humans reached Australia by ~50 kyr ago. Here we
report new stratigraphic and chronological evidence from Liang Bua that does not 
support the ages inferred previously for the H. floresiensis holotype (LB1), ~18 
thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present (kyr cal. BP), or the time
of last appearance of this species (about 17 or 13-11 kyr cal. BP). Instead, the 
skeletal remains of H. floresiensis and the deposits containing them are dated to
between about 100 and 60 kyr ago, whereas stone artefacts attributable to this
species range from about 190 to 50 kyr in age. Whether H. floresiensis survived
after 50 kyr ago--potentially encountering modern humans on Flores or other
hominins dispersing through southeast Asia, such as Denisovans--is an open
question.

It has been widely accepted that 5-methylcytosine is the only form of DNA
methylation in mammalian genomes. Here we identify N(6)-methyladenine as another 
form of DNA modification in mouse embryonic stem cells. Alkbh1 encodes a
demethylase for N(6)-methyladenine. An increase of N(6)-methyladenine levels in
Alkbh1-deficient cells leads to transcriptional silencing. N(6)-methyladenine
deposition is inversely correlated with the evolutionary age of LINE-1
transposons; its deposition is strongly enriched at young (<1.5 million years
old) but not old (>6 million years old) L1 elements. The deposition of
N(6)-methyladenine correlates with epigenetic silencing of such LINE-1
transposons, together with their neighbouring enhancers and genes, thereby
resisting the gene activation signals during embryonic stem cell differentiation.
As young full-length LINE-1 transposons are strongly enriched on the X
chromosome, genes located on the X chromosome are also silenced. Thus,
N(6)-methyladenine developed a new role in epigenetic silencing in mammalian
evolution distinct from its role in gene activation in other organisms. Our
results demonstrate that N(6)-methyladenine constitutes a crucial component of
the epigenetic regulation repertoire in mammalian genomes.

The chirality, or 'handedness', of a biologically active molecule can alter its
physiological properties. Thus it is routine procedure in the drug discovery and 
development process to prepare and fully characterize all possible stereoisomers 
of a drug candidate for biological evaluation. Despite many advances in
asymmetric synthesis, developing general and practical strategies for obtaining
all possible stereoisomers of an organic compound that has multiple contiguous
stereocentres remains a challenge. Here, we report a stereodivergent copper-based
approach for the expeditious construction of amino alcohols with high levels of
chemo-, regio-, diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Specifically, we synthesized
these amino-alcohol products using sequential, copper-hydride-catalysed
hydrosilylation and hydroamination of readily available enals and enones. This
strategy provides a route to all possible stereoisomers of the amino-alcohol
products, which contain up to three contiguous stereocentres. We leveraged
catalyst control and stereospecificity simultaneously to attain exceptional
control of the product stereochemistry. Beyond the immediate utility of this
protocol, our strategy could inspire the development of methods that provide
complete sets of stereoisomers for other valuable synthetic targets.

Circuits in the cerebral cortex consist of thousands of neurons connected by
millions of synapses. A precise understanding of these local networks requires
relating circuit activity with the underlying network structure. For pyramidal
cells in superficial mouse visual cortex (V1), a consensus is emerging that
neurons with similar visual response properties excite each other, but the
anatomical basis of this recurrent synaptic network is unknown. Here we combined 
physiological imaging and large-scale electron microscopy to study an excitatory 
network in V1. We found that layer 2/3 neurons organized into subnetworks defined
by anatomical connectivity, with more connections within than between groups.
More specifically, we found that pyramidal neurons with similar orientation
selectivity preferentially formed synapses with each other, despite the fact that
axons and dendrites of all orientation selectivities pass near (<5 μm) each other
with roughly equal probability. Therefore, we predict that mechanisms of
functionally specific connectivity take place at the length scale of spines.
Neurons with similar orientation tuning formed larger synapses, potentially
enhancing the net effect of synaptic specificity. With the ability to study
thousands of connections in a single circuit, functional connectomics is proving 
a powerful method to uncover the organizational logic of cortical networks.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major contributor to inflammatory
diseases, such as Crohn disease and type 2 diabetes. ER stress induces the
unfolded protein response, which involves activation of three transmembrane
receptors, ATF6, PERK and IRE1α. Once activated, IRE1α recruits TRAF2 to the ER
membrane to initiate inflammatory responses via the NF-κB pathway. Inflammation
is commonly triggered when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as
Toll-like receptors or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like
receptors, detect tissue damage or microbial infection. However, it is not clear 
which PRRs have a major role in inducing inflammation during ER stress. Here we
show that NOD1 and NOD2, two members of the NOD-like receptor family of PRRs, are
important mediators of ER-stress-induced inflammation in mouse and human cells.
The ER stress inducers thapsigargin and dithiothreitol trigger production of the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in a NOD1/2-dependent fashion. Inflammation and
IL-6 production triggered by infection with Brucella abortus, which induces ER
stress by injecting the type IV secretion system effector protein VceC into host 
cells, is TRAF2, NOD1/2 and RIP2-dependent and can be reduced by treatment with
the ER stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholate or an IRE1α kinase inhibitor. The
association of NOD1 and NOD2 with pro-inflammatory responses induced by the
IRE1α/TRAF2 signalling pathway provides a novel link between innate immunity and 
ER-stress-induced inflammation.

Somatic mutations are the driving force of cancer genome evolution. The rate of
somatic mutations appears to be greatly variable across the genome due to
variations in chromatin organization, DNA accessibility and replication timing.
However, other variables that may influence the mutation rate locally are
unknown, such as a role for DNA-binding proteins, for example. Here we
demonstrate that the rate of somatic mutations in melanomas is highly increased
at active transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome embedded DNA,
compared to their flanking regions. Using recently available excision-repair
sequencing (XR-seq) data, we show that the higher mutation rate at these sites is
caused by a decrease of the levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity. 
Our work demonstrates that DNA-bound proteins interfere with the NER machinery,
which results in an increased rate of DNA mutations at the protein binding sites.
This finding has important implications for our understanding of mutational and
DNA repair processes and in the identification of cancer driver mutations.

Promoters are DNA sequences that have an essential role in controlling gene
expression. While recent whole cancer genome analyses have identified numerous
hotspots of somatic point mutations within promoters, many have not yet been
shown to perturb gene expression or drive cancer development. As such, positive
selection alone may not adequately explain the frequency of promoter point
mutations in cancer genomes. Here we show that increased mutation density at gene
promoters can be linked to promoter activity and differential nucleotide excision
repair (NER). By analysing 1,161 human cancer genomes across 14 cancer types, we 
find evidence for increased local density of somatic point mutations within the
centres of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in gene promoters. Mutated DHSs
were strongly associated with transcription initiation activity, in which active 
promoters but not enhancers of equal DNase I hypersensitivity were most mutated
relative to their flanking regions. Notably, analysis of genome-wide maps of NER 
shows that NER is impaired within the DHS centre of active gene promoters, while 
XPC-deficient skin cancers do not show increased promoter mutation density,
pinpointing differential NER as the underlying cause of these mutation hotspots. 
Consistent with this finding, we observe that melanomas with an
ultraviolet-induced DNA damage mutation signature show greatest enrichment of
promoter mutations, whereas cancers that are not highly dependent on NER, such as
colon cancer, show no sign of such enrichment. Taken together, our analysis has
uncovered the presence of a previously unknown mechanism linking transcription
initiation and NER as a major contributor of somatic point mutation hotspots at
active gene promoters in cancer genomes.

Feedbacks between climate, erosion and tectonics influence the rates of chemical 
weathering reactions, which can consume atmospheric CO2 and modulate global
climate. However, quantitative predictions for the coupling of these feedbacks
are limited because the specific mechanisms by which climate controls erosion are
poorly understood. Here we show that climate-dependent chemical weathering
controls the erodibility of bedrock-floored rivers across a rainfall gradient on 
the Big Island of Hawai'i. Field data demonstrate that the physical strength of
bedrock in streambeds varies with the degree of chemical weathering, which
increases systematically with local rainfall rate. We find that incorporating the
quantified relationships between local rainfall and erodibility into a commonly
used river incision model is necessary to predict the rates and patterns of
downcutting of these rivers. In contrast to using only precipitation-dependent
river discharge to explain the climatic control of bedrock river incision, the
mechanism of chemical weathering can explain strong coupling between local
climate and river incision.

An important goal of modern organic chemistry is to develop new catalytic
strategies for enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation that can be used to 
generate quaternary stereogenic centres. Whereas considerable advances have been 
achieved by exploiting polar reactivity, radical transformations have been far
less successful. This is despite the fact that open-shell intermediates are
intrinsically primed for connecting structurally congested carbons, as their
reactivity is only marginally affected by steric factors. Here we show how the
combination of photoredox and asymmetric organic catalysis enables
enantioselective radical conjugate additions to β,β-disubstituted cyclic enones
to obtain quaternary carbon stereocentres with high fidelity. Critical to our
success was the design of a chiral organic catalyst, containing a redox-active
carbazole moiety, that drives the formation of iminium ions and the
stereoselective trapping of photochemically generated carbon-centred radicals by 
means of an electron-relay mechanism. We demonstrate the generality of this
organocatalytic radical-trapping strategy with two sets of open-shell
intermediates, formed through unrelated light-triggered pathways from readily
available substrates and photoredox catalysts--this method represents the
application of iminium ion activation (a successful catalytic strategy for
enantioselective polar chemistry) within the realm of radical reactivity.

Humans routinely solve problems of immense computational complexity by
intuitively forming simple, low-dimensional heuristic strategies. Citizen science
(or crowd sourcing) is a way of exploiting this ability by presenting scientific 
research problems to non-experts. 'Gamification'--the application of game
elements in a non-game context--is an effective tool with which to enable citizen
scientists to provide solutions to research problems. The citizen science games
Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire have been used successfully to study protein and RNA
folding and neuron mapping, but so far gamification has not been applied to
problems in quantum physics. Here we report on Quantum Moves, an online platform 
gamifying optimization problems in quantum physics. We show that human players
are able to find solutions to difficult problems associated with the task of
quantum computing. Players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails, and
analyses of their solutions provide insights into the problem of optimization of 
a more profound and general nature. Using player strategies, we have thus
developed a few-parameter heuristic optimization method that efficiently
outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The numerical
complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases for shorter process
durations. To understand this better, we produced a low-dimensional rendering of 
the optimization landscape. This rendering reveals why traditional optimization
methods fail near the quantum speed limit (that is, the shortest process duration
with perfect fidelity). Combined analyses of optimization landscapes and
heuristic solution strategies may benefit wider classes of optimization problems 
in quantum physics and beyond.

Spatial symmetries in crystals may be distinguished by whether they preserve the 
spatial origin. Here we study spatial symmetries that translate the origin by a
fraction of the lattice period, and find that these non-symmorphic symmetries
protect an exotic surface fermion whose dispersion relation is shaped like an
hourglass; surface bands connect one hourglass to the next in an unbreakable
zigzag pattern. These 'hourglass' fermions are formed in the large-gap
insulators, KHgX (X = As, Sb, Bi), which we propose as the first material class
whose band topology relies on non-symmorphic symmetries. Besides the hourglass
fermion, another surface of KHgX manifests a three-dimensional generalization of 
the quantum spin Hall effect, which has previously been observed only in
two-dimensional crystals. To describe the bulk topology of non-symmorphic
crystals, we propose a non-Abelian generalization of the geometric theory of
polarization. Our non-trivial topology originates from an inversion of the
rotational quantum numbers, which we propose as a criterion in the search for
topological materials.

In bright light, cone-photoreceptors are active and colour vision derives from a 
comparison of signals in cones with different visual pigments. This comparison
begins in the retina, where certain retinal ganglion cells have 'colour-opponent'
visual responses-excited by light of one colour and suppressed by another colour.
In dim light, rod-photoreceptors are active, but colour vision is impossible
because they all use the same visual pigment. Instead, the rod signals are
thought to splice into retinal circuits at various points, in synergy with the
cone signals. Here we report a new circuit for colour vision that challenges
these expectations. A genetically identified type of mouse retinal ganglion cell 
called JAMB (J-RGC), was found to have colour-opponent responses, OFF to
ultraviolet (UV) light and ON to green light. Although the mouse retina contains 
a green-sensitive cone, the ON response instead originates in rods. Rods and
cones both contribute to the response over several decades of light intensity.
Remarkably, the rod signal in this circuit is antagonistic to that from cones.
For rodents, this UV-green channel may play a role in social communication, as
suggested by spectral measurements from the environment. In the human retina, all
of the components for this circuit exist as well, and its function can explain
certain experiences of colour in dim lights, such as a 'blue shift' in twilight. 
The discovery of this genetically defined pathway will enable new targeted
studies of colour processing in the brain.

Microglia are damage sensors for the central nervous system (CNS), and the
phagocytes responsible for routine non-inflammatory clearance of dead brain
cells. Here we show that the TAM receptor tyrosine kinases Mer and Axl regulate
these microglial functions. We find that adult mice deficient in microglial Mer
and Axl exhibit a marked accumulation of apoptotic cells specifically in
neurogenic regions of the CNS, and that microglial phagocytosis of the apoptotic 
cells generated during adult neurogenesis is normally driven by both TAM receptor
ligands Gas6 and protein S. Using live two-photon imaging, we demonstrate that
the microglial response to brain damage is also TAM-regulated, as TAM-deficient
microglia display reduced process motility and delayed convergence to sites of
injury. Finally, we show that microglial expression of Axl is prominently
upregulated in the inflammatory environment that develops in a mouse model of
Parkinson's disease. Together, these results establish TAM receptors as both
controllers of microglial physiology and potential targets for therapeutic
intervention in CNS disease.

How tissue regeneration programs are triggered by injury has received limited
research attention. Here we investigate the existence of enhancer regulatory
elements that are activated in regenerating tissue. Transcriptomic analyses
reveal that leptin b (lepb) is highly induced in regenerating hearts and fins of 
zebrafish. Epigenetic profiling identified a short DNA sequence element upstream 
and distal to lepb that acquires open chromatin marks during regeneration and
enables injury-dependent expression from minimal promoters. This element could
activate expression in injured neonatal mouse tissues and was divisible into
tissue-specific modules sufficient for expression in regenerating zebrafish fins 
or hearts. Simple enhancer-effector transgenes employing lepb-linked sequences
upstream of pro- or anti-regenerative factors controlled the efficacy of
regeneration in zebrafish. Our findings provide evidence for 'tissue regeneration
enhancer elements' (TREEs) that trigger gene expression in injury sites and can
be engineered to modulate the regenerative potential of vertebrate organs.

Cells receive growth and survival stimuli through their attachment to an
extracellular matrix (ECM). Overcoming the addiction to ECM-induced signals is
required for anchorage-independent growth, a property of most malignant cells.
Detachment from ECM is associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) owing to altered glucose metabolism. Here we identify an
unconventional pathway that supports redox homeostasis and growth during
adaptation to anchorage independence. We observed that detachment from monolayer 
culture and growth as anchorage-independent tumour spheroids was accompanied by
changes in both glucose and glutamine metabolism. Specifically, oxidation of both
nutrients was suppressed in spheroids, whereas reductive formation of citrate
from glutamine was enhanced. Reductive glutamine metabolism was highly dependent 
on cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), because the activity was
suppressed in cells homozygous null for IDH1 or treated with an IDH1 inhibitor.
This activity occurred in absence of hypoxia, a well-known inducer of reductive
metabolism. Rather, IDH1 mitigated mitochondrial ROS in spheroids, and
suppressing IDH1 reduced spheroid growth through a mechanism requiring
mitochondrial ROS. Isotope tracing revealed that in spheroids, isocitrate/citrate
produced reductively in the cytosol could enter the mitochondria and participate 
in oxidative metabolism, including oxidation by IDH2. This generates NADPH in the
mitochondria, enabling cells to mitigate mitochondrial ROS and maximize growth.
Neither IDH1 nor IDH2 was necessary for monolayer growth, but deleting either one
enhanced mitochondrial ROS and reduced spheroid size, as did deletion of the
mitochondrial citrate transporter protein. Together, the data indicate that
adaptation to anchorage independence requires a fundamental change in citrate
metabolism, initiated by IDH1-dependent reductive carboxylation and culminating
in suppression of mitochondrial ROS.

Neoplastic pancreatic epithelial cells are believed to die through caspase
8-dependent apoptotic cell death, and chemotherapy is thought to promote tumour
apoptosis. Conversely, cancer cells often disrupt apoptosis to survive. Another
type of programmed cell death is necroptosis (programmed necrosis), but its role 
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is unclear. There are many potential
inducers of necroptosis in PDA, including ligation of tumour necrosis factor
receptor 1 (TNFR1), CD95, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
receptors, Toll-like receptors, reactive oxygen species, and chemotherapeutic
drugs. Here we report that the principal components of the necrosome,
receptor-interacting protein (RIP)1 and RIP3, are highly expressed in PDA and are
further upregulated by the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine. Blockade of the
necrosome in vitro promoted cancer cell proliferation and induced an aggressive
oncogenic phenotype. By contrast, in vivo deletion of RIP3 or inhibition of RIP1 
protected against oncogenic progression in mice and was associated with the
development of a highly immunogenic myeloid and T cell infiltrate. The
immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment associated with intact RIP1/RIP3
signalling depended in part on necroptosis-induced expression of the chemokine
attractant CXCL1, and CXCL1 blockade protected against PDA. Moreover, cytoplasmic
SAP130 (a subunit of the histone deacetylase complex) was expressed in PDA in a
RIP1/RIP3-dependent manner, and Mincle--its cognate receptor--was upregulated in 
tumour-infiltrating myeloid cells. Ligation of Mincle by SAP130 promoted
oncogenesis, whereas deletion of Mincle protected against oncogenesis and
phenocopied the immunogenic reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment that was
induced by RIP3 deletion. Cellular depletion suggested that whereas inhibitory
macrophages promote tumorigenesis in PDA, they lose their immune-suppressive
effects when RIP3 or Mincle is deleted. Accordingly, T cells, which are not
protective against PDA progression in mice with intact RIP3 or Mincle signalling,
are reprogrammed into indispensable mediators of anti-tumour immunity in the
absence of RIP3 or Mincle. Our work describes parallel networks of
necroptosis-induced CXCL1 and Mincle signalling that promote macrophage-induced
adaptive immune suppression and thereby enable PDA progression.

As the last habitable continent colonized by humans, the site of multiple
domestication hotspots, and the location of the largest Pleistocene megafaunal
extinction, South America is central to human prehistory. Yet remarkably little
is known about human population dynamics during colonization, subsequent
expansions, and domestication. Here we reconstruct the spatiotemporal patterns of
human population growth in South America using a newly aggregated database of
1,147 archaeological sites and 5,464 calibrated radiocarbon dates spanning
fourteen thousand to two thousand years ago (ka). We demonstrate that, rather
than a steady exponential expansion, the demographic history of South Americans
is characterized by two distinct phases. First, humans spread rapidly throughout 
the continent, but remained at low population sizes for 8,000 years, including a 
4,000-year period of 'boom-and-bust' oscillations with no net growth.
Supplementation of hunting with domesticated crops and animals had a minimal
impact on population carrying capacity. Only with widespread sedentism, beginning
~5 ka, did a second demographic phase begin, with evidence for exponential
population growth in cultural hotspots, characteristic of the Neolithic
transition worldwide. The unique extent of humanity's ability to modify its
environment to markedly increase carrying capacity in South America is therefore 
an unexpectedly recent phenomenon.

Direct observation of dynamic shear jamming in dense suspensions.

USA.

Liquid-like at rest, dense suspensions of hard particles can undergo striking
transformations in behaviour when agitated or sheared. These phenomena include
solidification during rapid impact, as well as strong shear thickening
characterized by discontinuous, orders-of-magnitude increases in suspension
viscosity. Much of this highly non-Newtonian behaviour has recently been
interpreted within the framework of a jamming transition. However, although
jamming indeed induces solid-like rigidity, even a strongly shear-thickened state
still flows and thus cannot be fully jammed. Furthermore, although suspensions
are incompressible, the onset of rigidity in the standard jamming scenario
requires an increase in particle density. Finally, whereas shear thickening
occurs in the steady state, impact-induced solidification is transient. As a
result, it has remained unclear how these dense suspension phenomena are related 
and how they are connected to jamming. Here we resolve this by systematically
exploring both the steady-state and transient regimes with the same experimental 
system. We demonstrate that a fully jammed, solid-like state can be reached
without compression and instead purely with shear, as recently proposed for dry
granular systems. This state is created by transient shear-jamming fronts, which 
we track directly. We also show that shear stress, rather than shear rate, is the
key control parameter. From these findings we map out a state diagram with
particle density and shear stress as variables. We identify discontinuous shear
thickening with a marginally jammed regime just below the onset of full,
solid-like jamming. This state diagram provides a unifying framework, compatible 
with prior experimental and simulation results on dense suspensions, that
connects steady-state and transient behaviour in terms of a dynamic shear-jamming
process.

Cancer is a disease of ageing. Clinically, aged cancer patients tend to have a
poorer prognosis than young. This may be due to accumulated cellular damage,
decreases in adaptive immunity, and chronic inflammation. However, the effects of
the aged microenvironment on tumour progression have been largely unexplored.
Since dermal fibroblasts can have profound impacts on melanoma progression, we
examined whether age-related changes in dermal fibroblasts could drive melanoma
metastasis and response to targeted therapy. Here we find that aged fibroblasts
secrete a Wnt antagonist, sFRP2, which activates a multi-step signalling cascade 
in melanoma cells that results in a decrease in β-catenin and
microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and ultimately the loss of
a key redox effector, APE1. Loss of APE1 attenuates the response of melanoma
cells to DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species, rendering the cells more 
resistant to targeted therapy (vemurafenib). Age-related increases in sFRP2 also 
augment both angiogenesis and metastasis of melanoma cells. These data provide an
integrated view of how fibroblasts in the aged microenvironment contribute to
tumour progression, offering new possibilities for the design of therapy for the 
elderly.

Evidence for human sacrifice is found throughout the archaeological record of
early civilizations, the ethnographic records of indigenous world cultures, and
the texts of the most prolific contemporary religions. According to the social
control hypothesis, human sacrifice legitimizes political authority and social
class systems, functioning to stabilize such social stratification. Support for
the social control hypothesis is largely limited to historical anecdotes of human
sacrifice, where the causal claims have not been subject to rigorous quantitative
cross-cultural tests. Here we test the social control hypothesis by applying
Bayesian phylogenetic methods to a geographically and socially diverse sample of 
93 traditional Austronesian cultures. We find strong support for models in which 
human sacrifice stabilizes social stratification once stratification has arisen, 
and promotes a shift to strictly inherited class systems. Whilst evolutionary
theories of religion have focused on the functionality of prosocial and moral
beliefs, our results reveal a darker link between religion and the evolution of
modern hierarchical societies.

Transected axons fail to regrow in the mature central nervous system. Astrocytic 
scars are widely regarded as causal in this failure. Here, using three
genetically targeted loss-of-function manipulations in adult mice, we show that
preventing astrocyte scar formation, attenuating scar-forming astrocytes, or
ablating chronic astrocytic scars all failed to result in spontaneous regrowth of
transected corticospinal, sensory or serotonergic axons through severe spinal
cord injury (SCI) lesions. By contrast, sustained local delivery via hydrogel
depots of required axon-specific growth factors not present in SCI lesions, plus 
growth-activating priming injuries, stimulated robust, laminin-dependent sensory 
axon regrowth past scar-forming astrocytes and inhibitory molecules in SCI
lesions. Preventing astrocytic scar formation significantly reduced this
stimulated axon regrowth. RNA sequencing revealed that astrocytes and
non-astrocyte cells in SCI lesions express multiple axon-growth-supporting
molecules. Our findings show that contrary to the prevailing dogma, astrocyte
scar formation aids rather than prevents central nervous system axon
regeneration.

Over the past decade, observations of giant exoplanets (Jupiter-size) have
provided key insights into their atmospheres, but the properties of lower-mass
exoplanets (sub-Neptune) remain largely unconstrained because of the challenges
of observing small planets. Numerous efforts to observe the spectra of
super-Earths--exoplanets with masses of one to ten times that of Earth--have so
far revealed only featureless spectra. Here we report a longitudinal thermal
brightness map of the nearby transiting super-Earth 55 Cancri e (refs 4, 5)
revealing highly asymmetric dayside thermal emission and a strong day-night
temperature contrast. Dedicated space-based monitoring of the planet in the
infrared revealed a modulation of the thermal flux as 55 Cancri e revolves around
its star in a tidally locked configuration. These observations reveal a hot spot 
that is located 41 ± 12 degrees east of the substellar point (the point at which 
incident light from the star is perpendicular to the surface of the planet). From
the orbital phase curve, we also constrain the nightside brightness temperature
of the planet to 1,380 ± 400 kelvin and the temperature of the warmest hemisphere
(centred on the hot spot) to be about 1,300 kelvin hotter (2,700 ± 270 kelvin) at
a wavelength of 4.5 micrometres, which indicates inefficient heat redistribution 
from the dayside to the nightside. Our observations are consistent with either an
optically thick atmosphere with heat recirculation confined to the planetary
dayside, or a planet devoid of atmosphere with low-viscosity magma flows at the
surface.

Accurate modelling and prediction of the local to continental-scale hydroclimate 
response to global warming is essential given the strong impact of hydroclimate
on ecosystem functioning, crop yields, water resources, and economic security.
However, uncertainty in hydroclimate projections remains large, in part due to
the short length of instrumental measurements available with which to assess
climate models. Here we present a spatial reconstruction of hydroclimate
variability over the past twelve centuries across the Northern Hemisphere derived
from a network of 196 at least millennium-long proxy records. We use this
reconstruction to place recent hydrological changes and future precipitation
scenarios in a long-term context of spatially resolved and temporally persistent 
hydroclimate patterns. We find a larger percentage of land area with relatively
wetter conditions in the ninth to eleventh and the twentieth centuries, whereas
drier conditions are more widespread between the twelfth and nineteenth
centuries. Our reconstruction reveals that prominent seesaw patterns of
alternating moisture regimes observed in instrumental data across the
Mediterranean, western USA, and China have operated consistently over the past
twelve centuries. Using an updated compilation of 128 temperature proxy records, 
we assess the relationship between the reconstructed centennial-scale Northern
Hemisphere hydroclimate and temperature variability. Even though dry and wet
conditions occurred over extensive areas under both warm and cold climate
regimes, a statistically significant co-variability of hydroclimate and
temperature is evident for particular regions. We compare the reconstructed
hydroclimate anomalies with coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model
simulations and find reasonable agreement during pre-industrial times. However,
the intensification of the twentieth-century-mean hydroclimate anomalies in the
simulations, as compared to previous centuries, is not supported by our new
multi-proxy reconstruction. This finding suggests that much work remains before
we can model hydroclimate variability accurately, and highlights the importance
of using palaeoclimate data to place recent and predicted hydroclimate changes in
a millennium-long context.

Numerous natural systems contain surfaces or threads that enable directional
water transport. This behaviour is usually ascribed to hierarchical structural
features at the microscale and nanoscale, with gradients in surface energy and
gradients in Laplace pressure thought to be the main driving forces. Here we
study the prey-trapping pitcher organs of the carnivorous plant Nepenthes alata. 
We find that continuous, directional water transport occurs on the surface of the
'peristome'--the rim of the pitcher--because of its multiscale structure, which
optimizes and enhances capillary rise in the transport direction, and prevents
backflow by pinning in place any water front that is moving in the reverse
direction. This results not only in unidirectional flow despite the absence of
any surface-energy gradient, but also in a transport speed that is much higher
than previously thought. We anticipate that the basic 'design' principles
underlying this behaviour could be used to develop artificial fluid-transport
systems with practical applications.

Coherent feedback control of a single qubit in diamond.

Engineering desired operations on qubits subjected to the deleterious effects of 
their environment is a critical task in quantum information processing, quantum
simulation and sensing. The most common approach relies on open-loop quantum
control techniques, including optimal-control algorithms based on analytical or
numerical solutions, Lyapunov design and Hamiltonian engineering. An alternative 
strategy, inspired by the success of classical control, is feedback control.
Because of the complications introduced by quantum measurement, closed-loop
control is less pervasive in the quantum setting and, with exceptions, its
experimental implementations have been mainly limited to quantum optics
experiments. Here we implement a feedback-control algorithm using a solid-state
spin qubit system associated with the nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond, using
coherent feedback to overcome the limitations of measurement-based feedback, and 
show that it can protect the qubit against intrinsic dephasing noise for
milliseconds. In coherent feedback, the quantum system is connected to an
auxiliary quantum controller (ancilla) that acquires information about the output
state of the system (by an entangling operation) and performs an appropriate
feedback action (by a conditional gate). In contrast to open-loop dynamical
decoupling techniques, feedback control can protect the qubit even against
Markovian noise and for an arbitrary period of time (limited only by the
coherence time of the ancilla), while allowing gate operations. It is thus more
closely related to quantum error-correction schemes, although these require
larger and increasing qubit overheads. Increasing the number of fresh ancillas
enables protection beyond their coherence time. We further evaluate the
robustness of the feedback protocol, which could be applied to quantum
computation and sensing, by exploring a trade-off between information gain and
decoherence protection, as measurement of the ancilla-qubit correlation after the
feedback algorithm voids the protection, even if the rest of the dynamics is
unchanged.

The signature of (60)Fe in deep-sea crusts indicates that one or more supernovae 
exploded in the solar neighbourhood about 2.2 million years ago. Recent isotopic 
analysis is consistent with a core-collapse or electron-capture supernova that
occurred 60 to 130 parsecs from the Sun. Moreover, peculiarities in the cosmic
ray spectrum point to a nearby supernova about two million years ago. The Local
Bubble of hot, diffuse plasma, in which the Solar System is embedded, originated 
from 14 to 20 supernovae within a moving group, whose surviving members are now
in the Scorpius-Centaurus stellar association. Here we report calculations of the
most probable trajectories and masses of the supernova progenitors, and hence
their explosion times and sites. The (60)Fe signal arises from two supernovae at 
distances between 90 and 100 parsecs. The closest occurred 2.3 million years ago 
at present-day galactic coordinates l = 327°, b = 11°, and the second-closest
exploded about 1.5 million years ago at l = 343°, b = 25°, with masses of 9.2 and
8.8 times the solar mass, respectively. The remaining supernovae, which formed
the Local Bubble, contribute to a smaller extent because they happened at larger 
distances and longer ago ((60)Fe has a half-life of 2.6 million years). There are
uncertainties relating to the nucleosynthesis yields and the loss of (60)Fe
during transport, but they do not influence the relative distribution of (60)Fe
in the crust layers, and therefore our model reproduces the measured relative
abundances very well.

The rate of supernovae in our local Galactic neighbourhood within a distance of
about 100 parsecs from Earth is estimated to be one every 2-4 million years,
based on the total rate in the Milky Way (2.0 ± 0.7 per century). Recent
massive-star and supernova activity in Earth's vicinity may be traced by
radionuclides with half-lives of up to 100 million years, if trapped in
interstellar dust grains that penetrate the Solar System. One such radionuclide
is (60)Fe (with a half-life of 2.6 million years), which is ejected in supernova 
explosions and winds from massive stars. Here we report that the (60)Fe signal
observed previously in deep-sea crusts is global, extended in time and of
interstellar origin from multiple events. We analysed deep-sea archives from all 
major oceans for (60)Fe deposition via the accretion of interstellar dust
particles. Our results reveal (60)Fe interstellar influxes onto Earth at 1.5-3.2 
million years ago and at 6.5-8.7 million years ago. The signal measured implies
that a few per cent of fresh (60)Fe was captured in dust and deposited on Earth. 
Our findings indicate multiple supernova and massive-star events during the last 
ten million years at distances of up to 100 parsecs.

Soils are integral to the function of all terrestrial ecosystems and to food and 
fibre production. An overlooked aspect of soils is their potential to mitigate
greenhouse gas emissions. Although proven practices exist, the implementation of 
soil-based greenhouse gas mitigation activities are at an early stage and
accurately quantifying emissions and reductions remains a substantial challenge. 
Emerging research and information technology developments provide the potential
for a broader inclusion of soils in greenhouse gas policies. Here we highlight
'state of the art' soil greenhouse gas research, summarize mitigation practices
and potentials, identify gaps in data and understanding and suggest ways to close
such gaps through new research, technology and collaboration.

Cytolytic proteins and peptide toxins are classical virulence factors of several 
bacterial pathogens which disrupt epithelial barrier function, damage cells and
activate or modulate host immune responses. Such toxins have not been identified 
previously in human pathogenic fungi. Here we identify the first, to our
knowledge, fungal cytolytic peptide toxin in the opportunistic pathogen Candida
albicans. This secreted toxin directly damages epithelial membranes, triggers a
danger response signalling pathway and activates epithelial immunity. Membrane
permeabilization is enhanced by a positive charge at the carboxy terminus of the 
peptide, which triggers an inward current concomitant with calcium influx. C.
albicans strains lacking this toxin do not activate or damage epithelial cells
and are avirulent in animal models of mucosal infection. We propose the name
'Candidalysin' for this cytolytic peptide toxin; a newly identified, critical
molecular determinant of epithelial damage and host recognition of the clinically
important fungus, C. albicans.

Brown and beige adipose tissues can dissipate chemical energy as heat through
thermogenic respiration, which requires uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1).
Thermogenesis from these adipocytes can combat obesity and diabetes, encouraging 
investigation of factors that control UCP1-dependent respiration in vivo. Here we
show that acutely activated thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue is defined by a
substantial increase in levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Remarkably, this process supports in vivo thermogenesis, as pharmacological
depletion of mitochondrial ROS results in hypothermia upon cold exposure, and
inhibits UCP1-dependent increases in whole-body energy expenditure. We further
establish that thermogenic ROS alter the redox status of cysteine thiols in brown
adipose tissue to drive increased respiration, and that Cys253 of UCP1 is a key
target. UCP1 Cys253 is sulfenylated during thermogenesis, while mutation of this 
site desensitizes the purine-nucleotide-inhibited state of the carrier to
adrenergic activation and uncoupling. These studies identify mitochondrial ROS
induction in brown adipose tissue as a mechanism that supports UCP1-dependent
thermogenesis and whole-body energy expenditure, which opens the way to improved 
therapeutic strategies for combating metabolic disorders.

Colonic epithelial cells are covered by thick inner and outer mucus layers. The
inner mucus layer is free of commensal microbiota, which contributes to the
maintenance of gut homeostasis. In the small intestine, molecules critical for
prevention of bacterial invasion into epithelia such as Paneth-cell-derived
anti-microbial peptides and regenerating islet-derived 3 (RegIII) family proteins
have been identified. Although there are mucus layers providing physical barriers
against the large number of microbiota present in the large intestine, the
mechanisms that separate bacteria and colonic epithelia are not fully elucidated.
Here we show that Ly6/PLAUR domain containing 8 (Lypd8) protein prevents
flagellated microbiota invading the colonic epithelia in mice. Lypd8, selectively
expressed in epithelial cells at the uppermost layer of the large intestinal
gland, was secreted into the lumen and bound flagellated bacteria including
Proteus mirabilis. In the absence of Lypd8, bacteria were present in the inner
mucus layer and many flagellated bacteria invaded epithelia. Lypd8(-/-) mice were
highly sensitive to intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS). Antibiotic elimination of Gram-negative flagellated bacteria restored the 
bacterial-free state of the inner mucus layer and ameliorated DSS-induced
intestinal inflammation in Lypd8(-/-) mice. Lypd8 bound to flagella and
suppressed motility of flagellated bacteria. Thus, Lypd8 mediates segregation of 
intestinal bacteria and epithelial cells in the colon to preserve intestinal
homeostasis.

Island biogeographical models consider islands either as geologically static with
biodiversity resulting from ecologically neutral immigration-extinction dynamics,
or as geologically dynamic with biodiversity resulting from
immigration-speciation-extinction dynamics influenced by changes in island
characteristics over millions of years. Present climate and spatial arrangement
of islands, however, are rather exceptional compared to most of the Late
Quaternary, which is characterized by recurrent cooler and drier glacial periods.
These climatic oscillations over short geological timescales strongly affected
sea levels and caused massive changes in island area, isolation and connectivity,
orders of magnitude faster than the geological processes of island formation,
subsidence and erosion considered in island theory. Consequences of these
oscillations for present biodiversity remain unassessed. Here we analyse the
effects of present and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) island area, isolation,
elevation and climate on key components of angiosperm diversity on islands
worldwide. We find that post-LGM changes in island characteristics, especially in
area, have left a strong imprint on present diversity of endemic species.
Specifically, the number and proportion of endemic species today is significantly
higher on islands that were larger during the LGM. Native species richness, in
turn, is mostly determined by present island characteristics. We conclude that an
appreciation of Late Quaternary environmental change is essential to understand
patterns of island endemism and its underlying evolutionary dynamics.

Accurate chromosome segregation requires timely dissolution of chromosome
cohesion after chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. Separase
is absolutely essential for cohesion dissolution in organisms from yeast to man. 
It cleaves the kleisin subunit of cohesin and opens the cohesin ring to allow
chromosome segregation. Cohesin cleavage is spatiotemporally controlled by
separase-associated regulatory proteins, including the inhibitory chaperone
securin, and by phosphorylation of both the enzyme and substrates. Dysregulation 
of this process causes chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, contributing to 
cancer and birth defects. Despite its essential functions, atomic structures of
separase have not been determined. Here we report crystal structures of the
separase protease domain from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum,
alone or covalently bound to unphosphorylated and phosphorylated inhibitory
peptides derived from a cohesin cleavage site. These structures reveal how
separase recognizes cohesin and how cohesin phosphorylation by polo-like kinase 1
(Plk1) enhances cleavage. Consistent with a previous cellular study, mutating two
securin residues in a conserved motif that partly matches the separase cleavage
consensus converts securin from a separase inhibitor to a substrate. Our study
establishes atomic mechanisms of substrate cleavage by separase and suggests
competitive inhibition by securin.

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are common inherited and sporadic
vascular malformations that cause strokes and seizures in younger individuals.
CCMs arise from endothelial cell loss of KRIT1, CCM2 or PDCD10, non-homologous
proteins that form an adaptor complex. How disruption of the CCM complex results 
in disease remains controversial, with numerous signalling pathways (including
Rho, SMAD and Wnt/β-catenin) and processes such as endothelial-mesenchymal
transition (EndMT) proposed to have causal roles. CCM2 binds to MEKK3 (refs 7, 8,
9, 10, 11), and we have recently shown that CCM complex regulation of MEKK3 is
essential during vertebrate heart development. Here we investigate this mechanism
in CCM disease pathogenesis. Using a neonatal mouse model of CCM disease, we show
that expression of the MEKK3 target genes Klf2 and Klf4, as well as Rho and
ADAMTS protease activity, are increased in the endothelial cells of early CCM
lesions. By contrast, we find no evidence of EndMT or increased SMAD or Wnt
signalling during early CCM formation. Endothelial-specific loss of Map3k3 (also 
known as Mekk3), Klf2 or Klf4 markedly prevents lesion formation, reverses the
increase in Rho activity, and rescues lethality. Consistent with these findings
in mice, we show that endothelial expression of KLF2 and KLF4 is increased in
human familial and sporadic CCM lesions, and that a disease-causing human CCM2
mutation abrogates the MEKK3 interaction without affecting CCM complex formation.
These studies identify gain of MEKK3 signalling and KLF2/4 function as causal
mechanisms for CCM pathogenesis that may be targeted to develop new CCM
therapeutics.

The quantum nature of the proton can crucially affect the structural and physical
properties of hydrogen compounds. For example, in the high-pressure phases of
H2O, quantum proton fluctuations lead to symmetrization of the hydrogen bond and 
reduce the boundary between asymmetric and symmetric structures in the phase
diagram by 30 gigapascals (ref. 3). Here we show that an analogous quantum
symmetrization occurs in the recently discovered sulfur hydride superconductor
with a superconducting transition temperature Tc of 203 kelvin at 155
gigapascals--the highest Tc reported for any superconductor so far.
Superconductivity occurs via the formation of a compound with chemical formula
H3S (sulfur trihydride) with sulfur atoms arranged on a body-centred cubic
lattice. If the hydrogen atoms are treated as classical particles, then for
pressures greater than about 175 gigapascals they are predicted to sit exactly
halfway between two sulfur atoms in a structure with Im3m symmetry. At lower
pressures, the hydrogen atoms move to an off-centre position, forming a short H-S
covalent bond and a longer H···S hydrogen bond in a structure with R3m symmetry. 
X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the H3S stoichiometry and the sulfur
lattice sites, but were unable to discriminate between the two phases. Ab initio 
density-functional-theory calculations show that quantum nuclear motion lowers
the symmetrization pressure by 72 gigapascals for H3S and by 60 gigapascals for
D3S. Consequently, we predict that the Im3m phase dominates the pressure range
within which the high Tc was measured. The observed pressure dependence of Tc is 
accurately reproduced in our calculations for the phase, but not for the R3m
phase. Therefore, the quantum nature of the proton fundamentally changes the
superconducting phase diagram of H3S.

Phorbol, the flagship member of the tigliane diterpene family, has been known for
over 80 years and has attracted attention from many chemists and biologists owing
to its intriguing chemical structure and the medicinal potential of phorbol
esters. Access to useful quantities of phorbol and related analogues has relied
on isolation from natural sources and semisynthesis. Despite efforts spanning 40 
years, chemical synthesis has been unable to compete with these strategies, owing
to its complexity and unusual placement of oxygen atoms. Purely synthetic
enantiopure phorbol has remained elusive, and biological synthesis has not led to
even the simplest members of this terpene family. Recently, the chemical
syntheses of eudesmanes, germacrenes, taxanes and ingenanes have all benefited
from a strategy inspired by the logic of two-phase terpene biosynthesis in which 
powerful C-C bond constructions and C-H bond oxidations go hand in hand. Here we 
implement a two-phase terpene synthesis strategy to achieve enantiospecific total
synthesis of (+)-phorbol in only 19 steps from the abundant monoterpene
(+)-3-carene. The purpose of this synthesis route is not to displace isolation or
semisynthesis as a means of generating the natural product per se, but rather to 
enable access to analogues containing unique placements of oxygen atoms that are 
otherwise inaccessible.

Developmental disabilities, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), intellectual disability (ID), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), affect
one in six children in the USA. Recently, gene mutations in patched domain
containing 1 (PTCHD1) have been found in ~1% of patients with ID and ASD.
Individuals with PTCHD1 deletion show symptoms of ADHD, sleep disruption,
hypotonia, aggression, ASD, and ID. Although PTCHD1 is probably critical for
normal development, the connection between its deletion and the ensuing
behavioural defects is poorly understood. Here we report that during early
post-natal development, mouse Ptchd1 is selectively expressed in the thalamic
reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic neurons that regulate
thalamocortical transmission, sleep rhythms, and attention. Ptchd1 deletion
attenuates TRN activity through mechanisms involving small conductance
calcium-dependent potassium currents (SK). TRN-restricted deletion of Ptchd1
leads to attention deficits and hyperactivity, both of which are rescued by
pharmacological augmentation of SK channel activity. Global Ptchd1 deletion
recapitulates learning impairment, hyper-aggression, and motor defects, all of
which are insensitive to SK pharmacological targeting and not found in the
TRN-restricted deletion mouse. This study maps clinically relevant behavioural
phenotypes onto TRN dysfunction in a human disease model, while also identifying 
molecular and circuit targets for intervention.

Instinctive reactions to danger are critical to the perpetuation of species and
are observed throughout the animal kingdom. The scent of predators induces an
instinctive fear response in mice that includes behavioural changes, as well as a
surge in blood stress hormones that mobilizes multiple body systems to escape
impending danger. How the olfactory system routes predator signals detected in
the nose to achieve these effects is unknown. Here we identify a specific area of
the olfactory cortex in mice that induces stress hormone responses to volatile
predator odours. Using monosynaptic and polysynaptic viral tracers, we found that
multiple olfactory cortical areas transmit signals to hypothalamic
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which control stress hormone
levels. However, only one minor cortical area, the amygdalo-piriform transition
area (AmPir), contained neurons upstream of CRH neurons that were activated by
volatile predator odours. Chemogenetic stimulation of AmPir activated CRH neurons
and induced an increase in blood stress hormones, mimicking an instinctive fear
response. Moreover, chemogenetic silencing of AmPir markedly reduced the stress
hormone response to predator odours without affecting a fear behaviour. These
findings suggest that AmPir, a small area comprising <5% of the olfactory cortex,
plays a key part in the hormonal component of the instinctive fear response to
volatile predator scents.

Diploidy is a fundamental genetic feature in mammals, in which haploid cells
normally arise only as post-meiotic germ cells that serve to ensure a diploid
genome upon fertilization. Gamete manipulation has yielded haploid embryonic stem
(ES) cells from several mammalian species, but haploid human ES cells have yet to
be reported. Here we generated and analysed a collection of human parthenogenetic
ES cell lines originating from haploid oocytes, leading to the successful
isolation and maintenance of human ES cell lines with a normal haploid karyotype.
Haploid human ES cells exhibited typical pluripotent stem cell characteristics,
such as self-renewal capacity and a pluripotency-specific molecular signature.
Moreover, we demonstrated the utility of these cells as a platform for
loss-of-function genetic screening. Although haploid human ES cells resembled
their diploid counterparts, they also displayed distinct properties including
differential regulation of X chromosome inactivation and of genes involved in
oxidative phosphorylation, alongside reduction in absolute gene expression levels
and cell size. Surprisingly, we found that a haploid human genome is compatible
not only with the undifferentiated pluripotent state, but also with
differentiated somatic fates representing all three embryonic germ layers both in
vitro and in vivo, despite a persistent dosage imbalance between the autosomes
and X chromosome. We expect that haploid human ES cells will provide novel means 
for studying human functional genomics and development.

Thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, are immune
modulatory drugs (IMiDs) used in the treatment of haematologic malignancies.
IMiDs bind CRBN, the substrate receptor of the CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (also known as
CRL4(CRBN)) E3 ubiquitin ligase, and inhibit ubiquitination of endogenous
CRL4(CRBN) substrates. Unexpectedly, IMiDs also repurpose the ligase to target
new proteins for degradation. Lenalidomide induces degradation of the lymphoid
transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos (also known as IKZF1 and IKZF3), and
casein kinase 1α (CK1α), which contributes to its clinical efficacy in the
treatment of multiple myeloma and 5q-deletion associated myelodysplastic syndrome
(del(5q) MDS), respectively. How lenalidomide alters the specificity of the
ligase to degrade these proteins remains elusive. Here we present the 2.45 Å
crystal structure of DDB1-CRBN bound to lenalidomide and CK1α. CRBN and
lenalidomide jointly provide the binding interface for a CK1α β-hairpin-loop
located in the kinase N-lobe. We show that CK1α binding to CRL4(CRBN) is strictly
dependent on the presence of an IMiD. Binding of IKZF1 to CRBN similarly requires
the compound and both, IKZF1 and CK1α, use a related binding mode. Our study
provides a mechanistic explanation for the selective efficacy of lenalidomide in 
del(5q) MDS therapy. We anticipate that high-affinity protein-protein
interactions induced by small molecules will provide opportunities for drug
development, particularly for targeted protein degradation.

Archaean komatiites (ultramafic lavas) result from melting under extreme
conditions of the Earth's mantle. Their chemical compositions evoke very high
eruption temperatures, up to 1,600 degrees Celsius, which suggests even higher
temperatures in their mantle source. This message is clouded, however, by
uncertainty about the water content in komatiite magmas. One school of thought
holds that komatiites were essentially dry and originated in mantle plumes while 
another argues that these magmas contained several per cent water, which
drastically reduced their eruption temperature and links them to subduction
processes. Here we report measurements of the content of water and other volatile
components, and of major and trace elements in melt inclusions in exceptionally
magnesian olivine (up to 94.5 mole per cent forsterite). This information
provides direct estimates of the composition and crystallization temperature of
the parental melts of Archaean komatiites. We show that the parental melt for
2.7-billion-year-old komatiites from the Abitibi greenstone belt in Canada
contained 30 per cent magnesium oxide and 0.6 per cent water by weight, and was
depleted in highly incompatible elements. This melt began to crystallize at
around 1,530 degrees Celsius at shallow depth and under reducing conditions, and 
it evolved via fractional crystallization of olivine, accompanied by minor
crustal assimilation. As its major- and trace-element composition and low oxygen 
fugacities are inconsistent with a subduction setting, we propose that its high
H2O/Ce ratio (over 6,000) resulted from entrainment into the komatiite source of 
hydrous material from the mantle transition zone. These results confirm a plume
origin for komatiites and high Archaean mantle temperatures, and evoke a hydrous 
reservoir in the deep mantle early in Earth's history.

Many important energy-transfer and optical processes, in both biological and
artificial systems, depend crucially on excitonic coupling that spans several
chromophores. Such coupling can in principle be described in a straightforward
manner by considering the coherent intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions
involved. However, in practice, it is challenging to directly observe in real
space the coherent dipole coupling and the related exciton delocalizations, owing
to the diffraction limit in conventional optics. Here we demonstrate that the
highly localized excitations that are produced by electrons tunnelling from the
tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope, in conjunction with imaging of the
resultant luminescence, can be used to map the spatial distribution of the
excitonic coupling in well-defined arrangements of a few zinc-phthalocyanine
molecules. The luminescence patterns obtained for excitons in a dimer, which are 
recorded for different energy states and found to resemble σ and π molecular
orbitals, reveal the local optical response of the system and the dependence of
the local optical response on the relative orientation and phase of the
transition dipoles of the individual molecules in the dimer. We generate an
in-line arrangement up to four zinc-phthalocyanine molecules, with a larger total
transition dipole, and show that this results in enhanced 'single-molecule'
superradiance from the oligomer upon site-selective excitation. These findings
demonstrate that our experimental approach provides detailed spatial information 
about coherent dipole-dipole coupling in molecular systems, which should enable a
greater understanding and rational engineering of light-harvesting structures and
quantum light sources.

The ability to measure tiny variations in the local gravitational acceleration
allows, besides other applications, the detection of hidden hydrocarbon reserves,
magma build-up before volcanic eruptions, and subterranean tunnels. Several
technologies are available that achieve the sensitivities required for such
applications (tens of microgal per hertz(1/2)): free-fall gravimeters,
spring-based gravimeters, superconducting gravimeters, and atom interferometers. 
All of these devices can observe the Earth tides: the elastic deformation of the 
Earth's crust as a result of tidal forces. This is a universally predictable
gravitational signal that requires both high sensitivity and high stability over 
timescales of several days to measure. All present gravimeters, however, have
limitations of high cost (more than 100,000 US dollars) and high mass (more than 
8 kilograms). Here we present a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) device with 
a sensitivity of 40 microgal per hertz(1/2) only a few cubic centimetres in size.
We use it to measure the Earth tides, revealing the long-term stability of our
instrument compared to any other MEMS device. MEMS accelerometers--found in most 
smart phones--can be mass-produced remarkably cheaply, but none are stable enough
to be called a gravimeter. Our device has thus made the transition from
accelerometer to gravimeter. The small size and low cost of this MEMS gravimeter 
suggests many applications in gravity mapping. For example, it could be mounted
on a drone instead of low-flying aircraft for distributed land surveying and
exploration, deployed to monitor volcanoes, or built into multi-pixel
density-contrast imaging arrays.

The cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase (CRL) family comprises over 200 members in
humans. The COP9 signalosome complex (CSN) regulates CRLs by removing their
ubiquitin-like activator NEDD8. The CUL4A-RBX1-DDB1-DDB2 complex (CRL4A(DDB2))
monitors the genome for ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage. CRL4A(DBB2) is
inactive in the absence of damaged DNA and requires CSN to regulate the repair
process. The structural basis of CSN binding to CRL4A(DDB2) and the principles of
CSN activation are poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy
structures for CSN in complex with neddylated CRL4A ligases to 6.4 Å resolution. 
The CSN conformers defined by cryo-electron microscopy and a novel apo-CSN
crystal structure indicate an induced-fit mechanism that drives CSN activation by
neddylated CRLs. We find that CSN and a substrate cannot bind simultaneously to
CRL4A, favouring a deneddylated, inactive state for substrate-free CRL4
complexes. These architectural and regulatory principles appear conserved across 
CRL families, allowing global regulation by CSN.

Polar temperatures over the last several million years have, at times, been
slightly warmer than today, yet global mean sea level has been 6-9 metres higher 
as recently as the Last Interglacial (130,000 to 115,000 years ago) and possibly 
higher during the Pliocene epoch (about three million years ago). In both cases
the Antarctic ice sheet has been implicated as the primary contributor, hinting
at its future vulnerability. Here we use a model coupling ice sheet and climate
dynamics-including previously underappreciated processes linking atmospheric
warming with hydrofracturing of buttressing ice shelves and structural collapse
of marine-terminating ice cliffs-that is calibrated against Pliocene and Last
Interglacial sea-level estimates and applied to future greenhouse gas emission
scenarios. Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of
sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15 metres by 2500, if emissions continue
unabated. In this case atmospheric warming will soon become the dominant driver
of ice loss, but prolonged ocean warming will delay its recovery for thousands of
years.

(β-)Arrestins are important regulators of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
They bind to active, phosphorylated GPCRs and thereby shut off 'classical'
signalling to G proteins, trigger internalization of GPCRs via interaction with
the clathrin machinery and mediate signalling via 'non-classical' pathways. In
addition to two visual arrestins that bind to rod and cone photoreceptors (termed
arrestin1 and arrestin4), there are only two (non-visual) β-arrestin proteins
(β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, also termed arrestin2 and arrestin3), which
regulate hundreds of different (non-visual) GPCRs. Binding of these proteins to
GPCRs usually requires the active form of the receptors plus their
phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). The binding of
receptors or their carboxy terminus as well as certain truncations induce active 
conformations of (β-)arrestins that have recently been solved by X-ray
crystallography. Here we investigate both the interaction of β-arrestin with
GPCRs, and the β-arrestin conformational changes in real time and in living human
cells, using a series of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based
β-arrestin2 biosensors. We observe receptor-specific patterns of conformational
changes in β-arrestin2 that occur rapidly after the receptor-β-arrestin2
interaction. After agonist removal, these changes persist for longer than the
direct receptor interaction. Our data indicate a rapid, receptor-type-specific,
two-step binding and activation process between GPCRs and β-arrestins. They
further indicate that β-arrestins remain active after dissociation from
receptors, allowing them to remain at the cell surface and presumably signal
independently. Thus, GPCRs trigger a rapid, receptor-specific
activation/deactivation cycle of β-arrestins, which permits their active
signalling.

Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that regulate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 
desensitization, internalization, trafficking and signalling. Arrestin
recruitment uncouples GPCRs from heterotrimeric G proteins, and targets the
proteins for internalization via clathrin-coated pits. Arrestins also function as
ligand-regulated scaffolds that recruit multiple non-G-protein effectors into
GPCR-based 'signalsomes'. Although the dominant function(s) of arrestins vary
between receptors, the mechanism whereby different GPCRs specify these divergent 
functions is unclear. Using a panel of intramolecular fluorescein arsenical
hairpin (FlAsH) bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) reporters to
monitor conformational changes in β-arrestin2, here we show that GPCRs impose
distinctive arrestin 'conformational signatures' that reflect the stability of
the receptor-arrestin complex and role of β-arrestin2 in activating or dampening 
downstream signalling events. The predictive value of these signatures extends to
structurally distinct ligands activating the same GPCR, such that the innate
properties of the ligand are reflected as changes in β-arrestin2 conformation.
Our findings demonstrate that information about ligand-receptor conformation is
encoded within the population average β-arrestin2 conformation, and provide
insight into how different GPCRs can use a common effector for different
purposes. This approach may have application in the characterization and
development of functionally selective GPCR ligands and in identifying factors
that dictate arrestin conformation and function.

Targeted, temporally regulated neural modulation is invaluable in determining the
physiological roles of specific neural populations or circuits. Here we describe 
a system for non-invasive, temporal activation or inhibition of neuronal activity
in vivo and its use to study central nervous system control of glucose
homeostasis and feeding in mice. We are able to induce neuronal activation
remotely using radio waves or magnetic fields via Cre-dependent expression of a
GFP-tagged ferritin fusion protein tethered to the cation-conducting transient
receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) by a camelid anti-GFP antibody
(anti-GFP-TRPV1). Neuronal inhibition via the same stimuli is achieved by
mutating the TRPV1 pore, rendering the channel chloride-permeable. These
constructs were targeted to glucose-sensing neurons in the ventromedial
hypothalamus in glucokinase-Cre mice, which express Cre in glucose-sensing
neurons. Acute activation of glucose-sensing neurons in this region increases
plasma glucose and glucagon, lowers insulin levels and stimulates feeding, while 
inhibition reduces blood glucose, raises insulin levels and suppresses feeding.
These results suggest that pancreatic hormones function as an effector mechanism 
of central nervous system circuits controlling blood glucose and behaviour. The
method we employ obviates the need for permanent implants and could potentially
be applied to study other neural processes or used to regulate other, even
dispersed, cell types.

The general transcription factor IID (TFIID) plays a central role in the
initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription by nucleating
pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly at the core promoter. TFIID comprises the
TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAF1-13), which
specifically interact with a variety of core promoter DNA sequences. Here we
present the structure of human TFIID in complex with TFIIA and core promoter DNA,
determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy at sub-nanometre
resolution. All core promoter elements are contacted by subunits of TFIID, with
TAF1 and TAF2 mediating major interactions with the downstream promoter. TFIIA
bridges the TBP-TATA complex with lobe B of TFIID. We also present the
cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a fully assembled human TAF-less PIC. 
Superposition of common elements between the two structures provides novel
insights into the general role of TFIID in promoter recognition, PIC assembly,
and transcription initiation.

A marked bias towards risk aversion has been observed in nearly every species
tested. A minority of individuals, however, instead seem to prefer risk
(repeatedly choosing uncertain large rewards over certain but smaller rewards),
and even risk-averse individuals sometimes opt for riskier alternatives. It is
not known how neural activity underlies such important shifts in
decision-making--either as a stable trait across individuals or at the level of
variability within individuals. Here we describe a model of risk-preference in
rats, in which stable individual differences, trial-by-trial choices, and
responses to pharmacological agents all parallel human behaviour. By combining
new genetic targeting strategies with optical recording of neural activity during
behaviour in this model, we identify relevant temporally specific signals from a 
genetically and anatomically defined population of neurons. This activity
occurred within dopamine receptor type-2 (D2R)-expressing cells in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), signalled unfavourable outcomes from the recent past at a time
appropriate for influencing subsequent decisions, and also predicted subsequent
choices made. Having uncovered this naturally occurring neural correlate of risk 
selection, we then mimicked the temporally specific signal with optogenetic
control during decision-making and demonstrated its causal effect in driving
risk-preference. Specifically, risk-preferring rats could be instantaneously
converted to risk-averse rats with precisely timed phasic stimulation of NAc D2R 
cells. These findings suggest that individual differences in risk-preference, as 
well as real-time risky decision-making, can be largely explained by the encoding
in D2R-expressing NAc cells of prior unfavourable outcomes during
decision-making.

Primary cilia are solitary, generally non-motile, hair-like protrusions that
extend from the surface of cells between cell divisions. Their antenna-like
structure leads naturally to the assumption that they sense the surrounding
environment, the most common hypothesis being sensation of mechanical force
through calcium-permeable ion channels within the cilium. This Ca(2+)-responsive 
mechanosensor hypothesis for primary cilia has been invoked to explain a large
range of biological responses, from control of left-right axis determination in
embryonic development to adult progression of polycystic kidney disease and some 
cancers. Here we report the complete lack of mechanically induced calcium
increases in primary cilia, in tissues upon which this hypothesis has been based.
We developed a transgenic mouse, Arl13b-mCherry-GECO1.2, expressing a ratiometric
genetically encoded calcium indicator in all primary cilia. We then measured
responses to flow in primary cilia of cultured kidney epithelial cells, kidney
thick ascending tubules, crown cells of the embryonic node, kinocilia of inner
ear hair cells, and several cell lines. Cilia-specific Ca(2+) influxes were not
observed in physiological or even highly supraphysiological levels of fluid flow.
We conclude that mechanosensation, if it originates in primary cilia, is not via 
calcium signalling.

Elements heavier than zinc are synthesized through the rapid (r) and slow (s)
neutron-capture processes. The main site of production of the r-process elements 
(such as europium) has been debated for nearly 60 years. Initial studies of
trends in chemical abundances in old Milky Way halo stars suggested that these
elements are produced continually, in sites such as core-collapse supernovae. But
evidence from the local Universe favours the idea that r-process production
occurs mainly during rare events, such as neutron star mergers. The appearance of
a plateau of europium abundance in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies has been
suggested as evidence for rare r-process enrichment in the early Universe, but
only under the assumption that no gas accretes into those dwarf galaxies; gas
accretion favours continual r-process enrichment in these systems. Furthermore,
the universal r-process pattern has not been cleanly identified in dwarf
spheroidals. The smaller, chemically simpler, and more ancient ultrafaint dwarf
galaxies assembled shortly after the first stars formed, and are ideal systems
with which to study nucleosynthesis events such as the r-process. Reticulum II is
one such galaxy. The abundances of non-neutron-capture elements in this galaxy
(and others like it) are similar to those in other old stars. Here, we report
that seven of the nine brightest stars in Reticulum II, observed with
high-resolution spectroscopy, show strong enhancements in heavy neutron-capture
elements, with abundances that follow the universal r-process pattern beyond
barium. The enhancement seen in this 'r-process galaxy' is two to three orders of
magnitude higher than that detected in any other ultrafaint dwarf galaxy. This
implies that a single, rare event produced the r-process material in Reticulum
II. The r-process yield and event rate are incompatible with the source being
ordinary core-collapse supernovae, but consistent with other possible sources,
such as neutron star mergers.

CD8(+) T cells have a central role in antitumour immunity, but their activity is 
suppressed in the tumour microenvironment. Reactivating the cytotoxicity of
CD8(+) T cells is of great clinical interest in cancer immunotherapy. Here we
report a new mechanism by which the antitumour response of mouse CD8(+) T cells
can be potentiated by modulating cholesterol metabolism. Inhibiting cholesterol
esterification in T cells by genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of
ACAT1, a key cholesterol esterification enzyme, led to potentiated effector
function and enhanced proliferation of CD8(+) but not CD4(+) T cells. This is due
to the increase in the plasma membrane cholesterol level of CD8(+) T cells, which
causes enhanced T-cell receptor clustering and signalling as well as more
efficient formation of the immunological synapse. ACAT1-deficient CD8(+) T cells 
were better than wild-type CD8(+) T cells at controlling melanoma growth and
metastasis in mice. We used the ACAT inhibitor avasimibe, which was previously
tested in clinical trials for treating atherosclerosis and showed a good human
safety profile, to treat melanoma in mice and observed a good antitumour effect. 
A combined therapy of avasimibe plus an anti-PD-1 antibody showed better efficacy
than monotherapies in controlling tumour progression. ACAT1, an established
target for atherosclerosis, is therefore also a potential target for cancer
immunotherapy.

Plant respiration results in an annual flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the
atmosphere that is six times as large as that due to the emissions from fossil
fuel burning, so changes in either will impact future climate. As plant
respiration responds positively to temperature, a warming world may result in
additional respiratory CO2 release, and hence further atmospheric warming. Plant 
respiration can acclimate to altered temperatures, however, weakening the
positive feedback of plant respiration to rising global air temperature, but a
lack of evidence on long-term (weeks to years) acclimation to climate warming in 
field settings currently hinders realistic predictions of respiratory release of 
CO2 under future climatic conditions. Here we demonstrate strong acclimation of
leaf respiration to both experimental warming and seasonal temperature variation 
for juveniles of ten North American tree species growing for several years in
forest conditions. Plants grown and measured at 3.4 °C above ambient temperature 
increased leaf respiration by an average of 5% compared to plants grown and
measured at ambient temperature; without acclimation, these increases would have 
been 23%. Thus, acclimation eliminated 80% of the expected increase in leaf
respiration of non-acclimated plants. Acclimation of leaf respiration per degree 
temperature change was similar for experimental warming and seasonal temperature 
variation. Moreover, the observed increase in leaf respiration per degree
increase in temperature was less than half as large as the average reported for
previous studies, which were conducted largely over shorter time scales in
laboratory settings. If such dampening effects of leaf thermal acclimation occur 
generally, the increase in respiration rates of terrestrial plants in response to
climate warming may be less than predicted, and thus may not raise atmospheric

Phonons and their interactions with other phonons, electrons or photons drive
energy gain, loss and transport in materials. Although the phonon density of
states has been measured and calculated in bulk crystalline semiconductors,
phonons remain poorly understood in nanomaterials, despite the increasing
prevalence of bottom-up fabrication of semiconductors from nanomaterials and the 
integration of nanometre-sized components into devices. Here we quantify the
phononic properties of bottom-up fabricated semiconductors as a function of
crystallite size using inelastic neutron scattering measurements and ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations. We show that, unlike in microcrystalline
semiconductors, the phonon modes of semiconductors with nanocrystalline domains
exhibit both reduced symmetry and low energy owing to mechanical softness at the 
surface of those domains. These properties become important when phonons couple
to electrons in semiconductor devices. Although it was initially believed that
the coupling between electrons and phonons is suppressed in nanocrystalline
materials owing to the scarcity of electronic states and their large energy
separation, it has since been shown that the electron-phonon coupling is large
and allows high energy-dissipation rates exceeding one electronvolt per
picosecond (refs 10-13). Despite detailed investigations into the role of phonons
in exciton dynamics, leading to a variety of suggestions as to the origins of
these fast transition rates and including attempts to numerically calculate them,
fundamental questions surrounding electron-phonon interactions in nanomaterials
remain unresolved. By combining the microscopic and thermodynamic theories of
phonons and our findings on the phononic properties of nanomaterials, we are able
to explain and then experimentally confirm the strong electron-phonon coupling
and fast multi-phonon transition rates of charge carriers to trap states. This
improved understanding of phonon processes permits the rational selection of
nanomaterials, their surface treatments, and the design of devices incorporating 
them.

Animals are grouped into ~35 'phyla' based upon the notion of distinct body
plans. Morphological and molecular analyses have revealed that a stage in the
middle of development--known as the phylotypic period--is conserved among species
within some phyla. Although these analyses provide evidence for their existence, 
phyla have also been criticized as lacking an objective definition, and
consequently based on arbitrary groupings of animals. Here we compare the
developmental transcriptomes of ten species, each annotated to a different
phylum, with a wide range of life histories and embryonic forms. We find that in 
all ten species, development comprises the coupling of early and late phases of
conserved gene expression. These phases are linked by a divergent
'mid-developmental transition' that uses species-specific suites of signalling
pathways and transcription factors. This mid-developmental transition overlaps
with the phylotypic period that has been defined previously for three of the ten 
phyla, suggesting that transcriptional circuits and signalling mechanisms active 
during this transition are crucial for defining the phyletic body plan and that
the mid-developmental transition may be used to define phylotypic periods in
other phyla. Placing these observations alongside the reported conservation of
mid-development within phyla, we propose that a phylum may be defined as a
collection of species whose gene expression at the mid-developmental transition
is both highly conserved among them, yet divergent relative to other species.

Focal amplifications of chromosome 3p13-3p14 occur in about 10% of melanomas and 
are associated with a poor prognosis. The melanoma-specific oncogene MITF resides
at the epicentre of this amplicon. However, whether other loci present in this
amplicon also contribute to melanomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that the
recently annotated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene SAMMSON is consistently
co-gained with MITF. In addition, SAMMSON is a target of the lineage-specific
transcription factor SOX10 and its expression is detectable in more than 90% of
human melanomas. Whereas exogenous SAMMSON increases the clonogenic potential in 
trans, SAMMSON knockdown drastically decreases the viability of melanoma cells
irrespective of their transcriptional cell state and BRAF, NRAS or TP53
mutational status. Moreover, SAMMSON targeting sensitizes melanoma to
MAPK-targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft
models. Mechanistically, SAMMSON interacts with p32, a master regulator of
mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism, to increase its mitochondrial targeting
and pro-oncogenic function. Our results indicate that silencing of the lineage
addiction oncogene SAMMSON disrupts vital mitochondrial functions in a
cancer-cell-specific manner; this silencing is therefore expected to deliver
highly effective and tissue-restricted anti-melanoma therapeutic responses.

African dust emission and transport exhibits variability on diurnal to decadal
timescales and is known to influence processes such as Amazon productivity,
Atlantic climate modes, regional atmospheric composition and radiative balance
and precipitation in the Sahel. To elucidate the role of African dust in the
climate system, it is necessary to understand the factors governing its emission 
and transport. However, African dust is correlated with seemingly disparate
atmospheric phenomena, including the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the North
Atlantic Oscillation, the meridional position of the intertropical convergence
zone, Sahelian rainfall and surface temperatures over the Sahara Desert, all of
which obfuscate the connection between dust and climate. Here we show that the
surface wind field responsible for most of the variability in North African dust 
emission reflects the topography of the Sahara, owing to orographic acceleration 
of the surface flow. As such, the correlations between dust and various climate
phenomena probably arise from the projection of the winds associated with these
phenomena onto an orographically controlled pattern of wind variability. A
161-year time series of dust from 1851 to 2011, created by projecting this wind
field pattern onto surface winds from a historical reanalysis, suggests that the 
highest concentrations of dust occurred from the 1910s to the 1940s and the 1970s
to the 1980s, and that there have been three periods of persistent anomalously
low dust concentrations--in the 1860s, 1950s and 2000s. Projections of the wind
pattern onto climate models give a statistically significant downward trend in
African dust emission and transport as greenhouse gas concentrations increase
over the twenty-first century, potentially associated with a slow-down of the
tropical circulation. Such a dust feedback, which is not represented in climate
models, may be of benefit to human and ecosystem health in West Africa via
improved air quality and increased rainfall. This feedback may also enhance
warming of the tropical North Atlantic, which would make the basin more suitable 
for hurricane formation and growth.

Graphene-based nanostructures exhibit electronic properties that are not present 
in extended graphene. For example, quantum confinement in carbon nanotubes and
armchair graphene nanoribbons leads to the opening of substantial electronic
bandgaps that are directly linked to their structural boundary conditions.
Nanostructures with zigzag edges are expected to host spin-polarized electronic
edge states and can thus serve as key elements for graphene-based spintronics.
The edge states of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) are predicted to couple
ferromagnetically along the edge and antiferromagnetically between the edges, but
direct observation of spin-polarized edge states for zigzag edge
topologies--including ZGNRs--has not yet been achieved owing to the limited
precision of current top-down approaches. Here we describe the bottom-up
synthesis of ZGNRs through surface-assisted polymerization and
cyclodehydrogenation of specifically designed precursor monomers to yield
atomically precise zigzag edges. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy we show
the existence of edge-localized states with large energy splittings. We expect
that the availability of ZGNRs will enable the characterization of their
predicted spin-related properties, such as spin confinement and filtering, and
will ultimately add the spin degree of freedom to graphene-based circuitry.

The earliest dynamic and thermal history of the Moon is not well understood. The 
hydrogen content of deposits near the lunar poles may yield insight into this
history, because these deposits (which are probably composed of water ice)
survive only if they remain in permanent shadow. If the orientation of the Moon
has changed, then the locations of the shadowed regions will also have changed.
The polar hydrogen deposits have been mapped by orbiting neutron spectrometers,
and their observed spatial distribution does not match the expected distribution 
of water ice inferred from present-day lunar temperatures. This finding is in
contrast to the distribution of volatiles observed in similar thermal
environments at Mercury's poles. Here we show that polar hydrogen preserves
evidence that the spin axis of the Moon has shifted: the hydrogen deposits are
antipodal and displaced equally from each pole along opposite longitudes. From
the direction and magnitude of the inferred reorientation, and from analysis of
the moments of inertia of the Moon, we hypothesize that this change in the spin
axis, known as true polar wander, was caused by a low-density thermal anomaly
beneath the Procellarum region. Radiogenic heating within this region resulted in
the bulk of lunar mare volcanism and altered the density structure of the Moon,
changing its moments of inertia. This resulted in true polar wander consistent
with the observed remnant polar hydrogen. This thermal anomaly still exists and, 
in part, controls the current orientation of the Moon. The Procellarum region was
most geologically active early in lunar history, which implies that polar wander 
initiated billions of years ago and that a large portion of the measured polar
hydrogen is ancient, recording early delivery of water to the inner Solar System.
Our hypothesis provides an explanation for the antipodal distribution of lunar
polar hydrogen, and connects polar volatiles to the geologic and geophysical
evolution of the Moon and the bombardment history of the early Solar System.

Olefin metathesis has had a large impact on modern organic chemistry, but
important shortcomings remain: for example, the lack of efficient processes that 
can be used to generate acyclic alkenyl halides. Halo-substituted ruthenium
carbene complexes decompose rapidly or deliver low activity and/or minimal
stereoselectivity, and our understanding of the corresponding
high-oxidation-state systems is limited. Here we show that previously unknown
halo-substituted molybdenum alkylidene species are exceptionally reactive and are
able to participate in high-yielding olefin metathesis reactions that afford
acyclic 1,2-disubstituted Z-alkenyl halides. Transformations are promoted by
small amounts of a catalyst that is generated in situ and used with unpurified,
commercially available and easy-to-handle liquid 1,2-dihaloethene reagents, and
proceed to high conversion at ambient temperature within four hours. We obtain
many alkenyl chlorides, bromides and fluorides in up to 91 per cent yield and
complete Z selectivity. This method can be used to synthesize biologically active
compounds readily and to perform site- and stereoselective fluorination of
complex organic molecules.

Lung metastasis is the lethal determinant in many cancers and a number of lines
of evidence point to monocytes and macrophages having key roles in its
development. Yet little is known about the immediate fate of incoming tumour
cells as they colonize this tissue, and even less known about how they make first
contact with the immune system. Primary tumours liberate circulating tumour cells
(CTCs) into the blood and we have developed a stable intravital two-photon lung
imaging model in mice for direct observation of the arrival of CTCs and
subsequent host interaction. Here we show dynamic generation of tumour
microparticles in shear flow in the capillaries within minutes of CTC entry.
Rather than dispersing under flow, many of these microparticles remain attached
to the lung vasculature or independently migrate along the inner walls of
vessels. Using fluorescent lineage reporters and flow cytometry, we observed
'waves' of distinct myeloid cell subsets that load differentially and
sequentially with this CTC-derived material. Many of these tumour-ingesting
myeloid cells collectively accumulated in the lung interstitium along with the
successful metastatic cells and, as previously understood, promote the
development of successful metastases from surviving tumour cells. Although the
numbers of these cells rise globally in the lung with metastatic exposure and
ingesting myeloid cells undergo phenotypic changes associated with microparticle 
ingestion, a consistently sparse population of resident conventional dendritic
cells, among the last cells to interact with CTCs, confer anti-metastatic
protection. This work reveals that CTC fragmentation generates immune-interacting
intermediates, and defines a competitive relationship between phagocyte
populations for tumour loading during metastatic cell seeding.

Microbial viruses can control host abundances via density-dependent lytic
predator-prey dynamics. Less clear is how temperate viruses, which coexist and
replicate with their host, influence microbial communities. Here we show that
virus-like particles are relatively less abundant at high host densities. This
suggests suppressed lysis where established models predict lytic dynamics are
favoured. Meta-analysis of published viral and microbial densities showed that
this trend was widespread in diverse ecosystems ranging from soil to freshwater
to human lungs. Experimental manipulations showed viral densities more consistent
with temperate than lytic life cycles at increasing microbial abundance. An
analysis of 24 coral reef viromes showed a relative increase in the abundance of 
hallmark genes encoded by temperate viruses with increased microbial abundance.
Based on these four lines of evidence, we propose the Piggyback-the-Winner model 
wherein temperate dynamics become increasingly important in ecosystems with high 
microbial densities; thus 'more microbes, fewer viruses'.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
progressive memory decline and subsequent loss of broader cognitive functions.
Memory decline in the early stages of AD is mostly limited to episodic memory,
for which the hippocampus has a crucial role. However, it has been uncertain
whether the observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is due to disrupted
encoding and consolidation of episodic information, or an impairment in the
retrieval of stored memory information. Here we show that in transgenic mouse
models of early AD, direct optogenetic activation of hippocampal memory engram
cells results in memory retrieval despite the fact that these mice are amnesic in
long-term memory tests when natural recall cues are used, revealing a retrieval, 
rather than a storage impairment. Before amyloid plaque deposition, the amnesia
in these mice is age-dependent, which correlates with a progressive reduction in 
spine density of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells. We show that optogenetic
induction of long-term potentiation at perforant path synapses of dentate gyrus
engram cells restores both spine density and long-term memory. We also
demonstrate that an ablation of dentate gyrus engram cells containing restored
spine density prevents the rescue of long-term memory. Thus, selective rescue of 
spine density in engram cells may lead to an effective strategy for treating
memory loss in the early stages of AD.

Mutations disabling the TP53 tumour suppressor gene represent the most frequent
events in human cancer and typically occur through a two-hit mechanism involving 
a missense mutation in one allele and a 'loss of heterozygosity' deletion
encompassing the other. While TP53 missense mutations can also contribute
gain-of-function activities that impact tumour progression, it remains unclear
whether the deletion event, which frequently includes many genes, impacts
tumorigenesis beyond TP53 loss alone. Here we show that somatic heterozygous
deletion of mouse chromosome 11B3, a 4-megabase region syntenic to human 17p13.1,
produces a greater effect on lymphoma and leukaemia development than Trp53
deletion. Mechanistically, the effect of 11B3 loss on tumorigenesis involves
co-deleted genes such as Eif5a and Alox15b (also known as Alox8), the suppression
of which cooperates with Trp53 loss to produce more aggressive disease. Our
results imply that the selective advantage produced by human chromosome 17p
deletion reflects the combined impact of TP53 loss and the reduced dosage of
linked tumour suppressor genes.

Galactic cosmic rays reach energies of at least a few petaelectronvolts (of the
order of 10(15) electronvolts). This implies that our Galaxy contains
petaelectronvolt accelerators ('PeVatrons'), but all proposed models of Galactic 
cosmic-ray accelerators encounter difficulties at exactly these energies. Dozens 
of Galactic accelerators capable of accelerating particles to energies of tens of
teraelectronvolts (of the order of 10(13) electronvolts) were inferred from
recent γ-ray observations. However, none of the currently known accelerators--not
even the handful of shell-type supernova remnants commonly believed to supply
most Galactic cosmic rays--has shown the characteristic tracers of
petaelectronvolt particles, namely, power-law spectra of γ-rays extending without
a cut-off or a spectral break to tens of teraelectronvolts. Here we report deep
γ-ray observations with arcminute angular resolution of the region surrounding
the Galactic Centre, which show the expected tracer of the presence of
petaelectronvolt protons within the central 10 parsecs of the Galaxy. We propose 
that the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is linked to this PeVatron.
Sagittarius A* went through active phases in the past, as demonstrated by X-ray
outburstsand an outflow from the Galactic Centre. Although its current rate of
particle acceleration is not sufficient to provide a substantial contribution to 
Galactic cosmic rays, Sagittarius A* could have plausibly been more active over
the last 10(6)-10(7) years, and therefore should be considered as a viable
alternative to supernova remnants as a source of petaelectronvolt Galactic cosmic
rays.

The integrated stress response (ISR) is a homeostatic mechanism by which
eukaryotic cells sense and respond to stress-inducing signals, such as amino acid
starvation. General controlled non-repressed (GCN2) kinase is a key orchestrator 
of the ISR, and modulates protein synthesis in response to amino acid starvation.
Here we demonstrate in mice that GCN2 controls intestinal inflammation by
suppressing inflammasome activation. Enhanced activation of ISR was observed in
intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells during amino acid
starvation, or intestinal inflammation. Genetic deletion of Gcn2 (also known as
Eif2ka4) in CD11c(+) APCs or intestinal epithelial cells resulted in enhanced
intestinal inflammation and T helper 17 cell (TH17) responses, owing to enhanced 
inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1β production. This was caused by
reduced autophagy in Gcn2(-/-) intestinal APCs and epithelial cells, leading to
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potent activator of inflammasomes.
Thus, conditional ablation of Atg5 or Atg7 in intestinal APCs resulted in
enhanced ROS and TH17 responses. Furthermore, in vivo blockade of ROS and IL-1β
resulted in inhibition of TH17 responses and reduced inflammation in Gcn2(-/-)
mice. Importantly, acute amino acid starvation suppressed intestinal inflammation
via a mechanism dependent on GCN2. These results reveal a mechanism that couples 
amino acid sensing with control of intestinal inflammation via GCN2.

The energetic burden of continuously concentrating solutes against gradients
along the tubule may render the kidney especially vulnerable to ischaemia. Acute 
kidney injury (AKI) affects 3% of all hospitalized patients. Here we show that
the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, PGC1α, is a pivotal determinant of renal 
recovery from injury by regulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)
biosynthesis. Following renal ischaemia, Pgc1α(-/-) (also known as Ppargc1a(-/-))
mice develop local deficiency of the NAD precursor niacinamide (NAM, also known
as nicotinamide), marked fat accumulation, and failure to re-establish normal
function. Notably, exogenous NAM improves local NAD levels, fat accumulation, and
renal function in post-ischaemic Pgc1α(-/-) mice. Inducible tubular transgenic
mice (iNephPGC1α) recapitulate the effects of NAM supplementation, including more
local NAD and less fat accumulation with better renal function after ischaemia.
PGC1α coordinately upregulates the enzymes that synthesize NAD de novo from amino
acids whereas PGC1α deficiency or AKI attenuates the de novo pathway. NAM
enhances NAD via the enzyme NAMPT and augments production of the fat breakdown
product β-hydroxybutyrate, leading to increased production of prostaglandin PGE2 
(ref. 5), a secreted autacoid that maintains renal function. NAM treatment
reverses established ischaemic AKI and also prevented AKI in an unrelated toxic
model. Inhibition of β-hydroxybutyrate signalling or prostaglandin production
similarly abolishes PGC1α-dependent renoprotection. Given the importance of
mitochondrial health in ageing and the function of metabolically active organs,
the results implicate NAM and NAD as key effectors for achieving PGC1α-dependent 
stress resistance.

Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are biosynthetic factories that produce natural
products with important biological and pharmacological activities. Their
exceptional product diversity is encoded in a modular architecture. Modular PKSs 
(modPKSs) catalyse reactions colinear to the order of modules in an assembly
line, whereas iterative PKSs (iPKSs) use a single module iteratively as
exemplified by fungal iPKSs (fiPKSs). However, in some cases non-colinear
iterative action is also observed for modPKSs modules and is controlled by the
assembly line environment. PKSs feature a structural and functional separation
into a condensing and a modifying region as observed for fatty acid synthases.
Despite the outstanding relevance of PKSs, the detailed organization of PKSs with
complete fully reducing modifying regions remains elusive. Here we report a
hybrid crystal structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis mycocerosic acid synthase
based on structures of its condensing and modifying regions. Mycocerosic acid
synthase is a fully reducing iPKS, closely related to modPKSs, and the prototype 
of mycobacterial mycocerosic acid synthase-like PKSs. It is involved in the
biosynthesis of C20-C28 branched-chain fatty acids, which are important virulence
factors of mycobacteria. Our structural data reveal a dimeric linker-based
organization of the modifying region and visualize dynamics and conformational
coupling in PKSs. On the basis of comparative small-angle X-ray scattering, the
observed modifying region architecture may be common also in modPKSs. The
linker-based organization provides a rationale for the characteristic variability
of PKS modules as a main contributor to product diversity. The comprehensive
architectural model enables functional dissection and re-engineering of PKSs.

particles.

Crystal surfaces typically melt into a thin liquid layer at temperatures slightly
below the melting point of the crystal. Such surface premelting is prevalent in
all classes of solids and is important in a variety of metallurgical, geological 
and meteorological phenomena. Premelting has been studied using X-ray diffraction
and differential scanning calorimetry, but the lack of single-particle resolution
makes it hard to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Colloids are good model
systems for studying phase transitions because the thermal motions of individual 
micrometre-sized particles can be tracked directly using optical microscopy. Here
we use colloidal spheres with tunable attractions to form equilibrium
crystal-vapour interfaces, and study their surface premelting behaviour at the
single-particle level. We find that monolayer colloidal crystals exhibit
incomplete premelting at their perimeter, with a constant liquid-layer thickness.
In contrast, two- and three-layer crystals exhibit conventional complete melting,
with the thickness of the surface liquid diverging as the melting point is
approached. The microstructures of the surface liquids differ in certain aspects 
from what would be predicted by conventional premelting theories. Incomplete
premelting in the monolayer crystals is triggered by a bulk isostructural
solid-solid transition and truncated by a mechanical instability that separately 
induces homogeneous melting within the bulk. This finding is in contrast to the
conventional assumption that two-dimensional crystals melt heterogeneously from
their free surfaces (that is, at the solid-vapour interface). The unexpected bulk
melting that we observe for the monolayer crystals is accompanied by the
formation of grain boundaries, which supports a previously proposed
grain-boundary-mediated two-dimensional melting theory. The observed interplay
between surface premelting, bulk melting and solid-solid transitions challenges
existing theories of surface premelting and two-dimensional melting.

A unique assemblage of 28 hominin individuals, found in Sima de los Huesos in the
Sierra de Atapuerca in Spain, has recently been dated to approximately 430,000
years ago. An interesting question is how these Middle Pleistocene hominins were 
related to those who lived in the Late Pleistocene epoch, in particular to
Neanderthals in western Eurasia and to Denisovans, a sister group of Neanderthals
so far known only from southern Siberia. While the Sima de los Huesos hominins
share some derived morphological features with Neanderthals, the mitochondrial
genome retrieved from one individual from Sima de los Huesos is more closely
related to the mitochondrial DNA of Denisovans than to that of Neanderthals.
However, since the mitochondrial DNA does not reveal the full picture of
relationships among populations, we have investigated DNA preservation in several
individuals found at Sima de los Huesos. Here we recover nuclear DNA sequences
from two specimens, which show that the Sima de los Huesos hominins were related 
to Neanderthals rather than to Denisovans, indicating that the population
divergence between Neanderthals and Denisovans predates 430,000 years ago. A
mitochondrial DNA recovered from one of the specimens shares the previously
described relationship to Denisovan mitochondrial DNAs, suggesting, among other
possibilities, that the mitochondrial DNA gene pool of Neanderthals turned over
later in their history.

Impact of meat and Lower Palaeolithic food processing techniques on chewing in
humans.

Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, USA.

The origins of the genus Homo are murky, but by H. erectus, bigger brains and
bodies had evolved that, along with larger foraging ranges, would have increased 
the daily energetic requirements of hominins. Yet H. erectus differs from earlier
hominins in having relatively smaller teeth, reduced chewing muscles, weaker
maximum bite force capabilities, and a relatively smaller gut. This paradoxical
combination of increased energy demands along with decreased masticatory and
digestive capacities is hypothesized to have been made possible by adding meat to
the diet, by mechanically processing food using stone tools, or by cooking.
Cooking, however, was apparently uncommon until 500,000 years ago, and the
effects of carnivory and Palaeolithic processing techniques on mastication are
unknown. Here we report experiments that tested how Lower Palaeolithic processing
technologies affect chewing force production and efficacy in humans consuming
meat and underground storage organs (USOs). We find that if meat comprised
one-third of the diet, the number of chewing cycles per year would have declined 
by nearly 2 million (a 13% reduction) and total masticatory force required would 
have declined by 15%. Furthermore, by simply slicing meat and pounding USOs,
hominins would have improved their ability to chew meat into smaller particles by
41%, reduced the number of chews per year by another 5%, and decreased
masticatory force requirements by an additional 12%. Although cooking has
important benefits, it appears that selection for smaller masticatory features in
Homo would have been initially made possible by the combination of using stone
tools and eating meat.

Deception is common in nature and humans are no exception. Modern societies have 
created institutions to control cheating, but many situations remain where only
intrinsic honesty keeps people from cheating and violating rules. Psychological, 
sociological and economic theories suggest causal pathways to explain how the
prevalence of rule violations in people's social environment, such as corruption,
tax evasion or political fraud, can compromise individual intrinsic honesty. Here
we present cross-societal experiments from 23 countries around the world that
demonstrate a robust link between the prevalence of rule violations and intrinsic
honesty. We developed an index of the 'prevalence of rule violations' (PRV) based
on country-level data from the year 2003 of corruption, tax evasion and
fraudulent politics. We measured intrinsic honesty in an anonymous die-rolling
experiment. We conducted the experiments with 2,568 young participants (students)
who, due to their young age in 2003, could not have influenced PRV in 2003. We
find individual intrinsic honesty is stronger in the subject pools of low PRV
countries than those of high PRV countries. The details of lying patterns support
psychological theories of honesty. The results are consistent with theories of
the cultural co-evolution of institutions and values, and show that weak
institutions and cultural legacies that generate rule violations not only have
direct adverse economic consequences, but might also impair individual intrinsic 
honesty that is crucial for the smooth functioning of society.

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis and liver
cancer. Hepatitis B virus encodes the regulatory HBx protein whose primary role
is to promote transcription of the viral genome, which persists as an
extrachromosomal DNA circle in infected cells. HBx accomplishes this task by an
unusual mechanism, enhancing transcription only from extrachromosomal DNA
templates. Here we show that HBx achieves this by hijacking the cellular
DDB1-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase to target the 'structural maintenance of
chromosomes' (Smc) complex Smc5/6 for degradation. Blocking this event inhibits
the stimulatory effect of HBx both on extrachromosomal reporter genes and on
hepatitis B virus transcription. Conversely, silencing the Smc5/6 complex
enhances extrachromosomal reporter gene transcription in the absence of HBx,
restores replication of an HBx-deficient hepatitis B virus, and rescues wild-type
hepatitis B virus in a DDB1-knockdown background. The Smc5/6 complex associates
with extrachromosomal reporters and the hepatitis B virus genome, suggesting a
direct mechanism of transcriptional inhibition. These results uncover a novel
role for the Smc5/6 complex as a restriction factor selectively blocking
extrachromosomal DNA transcription. By destroying this complex, HBx relieves the 
inhibition to allow productive hepatitis B virus gene expression.

Knowledge of the contribution that individual countries have made to global
radiative forcing is important to the implementation of the agreement on "common 
but differentiated responsibilities" reached by the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. Over the past three decades, China has experienced 
rapid economic development, accompanied by increased emission of greenhouse
gases, ozone precursors and aerosols, but the magnitude of the associated
radiative forcing has remained unclear. Here we use a global coupled
biogeochemistry-climate model and a chemistry and transport model to quantify
China's present-day contribution to global radiative forcing due to well-mixed
greenhouse gases, short-lived atmospheric climate forcers and land-use-induced
regional surface albedo changes. We find that China contributes 10% ± 4% of the
current global radiative forcing. China's relative contribution to the positive
(warming) component of global radiative forcing, mainly induced by well-mixed
greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols, is 12% ± 2%. Its relative
contribution to the negative (cooling) component is 15% ± 6%, dominated by the
effect of sulfate and nitrate aerosols. China's strongest contributions are
0.16 ± 0.02 watts per square metre for CO2 from fossil fuel burning, 0.13 ± 0.05 
watts per square metre for CH4, -0.11 ± 0.05 watts per square metre for sulfate
aerosols, and 0.09 ± 0.06 watts per square metre for black carbon aerosols.
China's eventual goal of improving air quality will result in changes in
radiative forcing in the coming years: a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions
would drive a faster future warming, unless offset by larger reductions of
radiative forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon.

Quantum computing is an emerging area within the information sciences revolving
around the concept of quantum bits (qubits). A major obstacle is the extreme
fragility of these qubits due to interactions with their environment that destroy
their quantumness. This phenomenon, known as decoherence, is of fundamental
interest. There are many competing candidates for qubits, including
superconducting circuits, quantum optical cavities, ultracold atoms and spin
qubits, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. When dealing with spin qubits,
the strongest source of decoherence is the magnetic dipolar interaction. To
minimize it, spins are typically diluted in a diamagnetic matrix. For example,
this dilution can be taken to the extreme of a single phosphorus atom in silicon,
whereas in molecular matrices a typical ratio is one magnetic molecule per 10,000
matrix molecules. However, there is a fundamental contradiction between reducing 
decoherence by dilution and allowing quantum operations via the interaction
between spin qubits. To resolve this contradiction, the design and engineering of
quantum hardware can benefit from a 'bottom-up' approach whereby the electronic
structure of magnetic molecules is chemically tailored to give the desired
physical behaviour. Here we present a way of enhancing coherence in solid-state
molecular spin qubits without resorting to extreme dilution. It is based on the
design of molecular structures with crystal field ground states possessing large 
tunnelling gaps that give rise to optimal operating points, or atomic clock
transitions, at which the quantum spin dynamics become protected against dipolar 
decoherence. This approach is illustrated with a holmium molecular nanomagnet in 
which long coherence times (up to 8.4 microseconds at 5 kelvin) are obtained at
unusually high concentrations. This finding opens new avenues for quantum
computing based on molecular spin qubits.

Controlled formation of non-equilibrium crystal structures is one of the most
important challenges in crystal growth. Catalytically grown nanowires are ideal
systems for studying the fundamental physics of phase selection, and could lead
to new electronic applications based on the engineering of crystal phases. Here
we image gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanowires during growth as they switch between
phases as a result of varying growth conditions. We find clear differences
between the growth dynamics of the phases, including differences in interface
morphology, step flow and catalyst geometry. We explain these differences, and
the phase selection, using a model that relates the catalyst volume, the contact 
angle at the trijunction (the point at which solid, liquid and vapour meet) and
the nucleation site of each new layer of GaAs. This model allows us to predict
the conditions under which each phase should be observed, and use these
predictions to design GaAs heterostructures. These results could apply to phase
selection in other nanowire systems.

Muscarinic M1-M5 acetylcholine receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that
regulate many vital functions of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In
particular, the M1 and M4 receptor subtypes have emerged as attractive drug
targets for treatments of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia, but the high conservation of the acetylcholine-binding pocket has 
spurred current research into targeting allosteric sites on these receptors. Here
we report the crystal structures of the M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors bound to
the inverse agonist, tiotropium. Comparison of these structures with each other, 
as well as with the previously reported M2 and M3 receptor structures, reveals
differences in the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites that contribute to a 
role in drug selectivity at this important receptor family. We also report
identification of a cluster of residues that form a network linking the
orthosteric and allosteric sites of the M4 receptor, which provides new insight
into how allosteric modulation may be transmitted between the two spatially
distinct domains.

Many biopolymers, including polysaccharides, must be translocated across at least
one membrane to reach their site of biological function. Cellulose is a linear
glucose polymer synthesized and secreted by a membrane-integrated cellulose
synthase. Here, in crystallo enzymology with the catalytically active bacterial
cellulose synthase BcsA-BcsB complex reveals structural snapshots of a complete
cellulose biosynthesis cycle, from substrate binding to polymer translocation.
Substrate- and product-bound structures of BcsA provide the basis for substrate
recognition and demonstrate the stepwise elongation of cellulose. Furthermore,
the structural snapshots show that BcsA translocates cellulose via a ratcheting
mechanism involving a 'finger helix' that contacts the polymer's terminal
glucose. Cooperating with BcsA's gating loop, the finger helix moves 'up' and
'down' in response to substrate binding and polymer elongation, respectively,
thereby pushing the elongated polymer into BcsA's transmembrane channel. This
mechanism is validated experimentally by tethering BcsA's finger helix, which
inhibits polymer translocation but not elongation.

The eye is a complex organ with highly specialized constituent tissues derived
from different primordial cell lineages. The retina, for example, develops from
neuroectoderm via the optic vesicle, the corneal epithelium is descended from
surface ectoderm, while the iris and collagen-rich stroma of the cornea have a
neural crest origin. Recent work with pluripotent stem cells in culture has
revealed a previously under-appreciated level of intrinsic cellular
self-organization, with a focus on the retina and retinal cells. Moreover, we and
others have demonstrated the in vitro induction of a corneal epithelial cell
phenotype from pluripotent stem cells. These studies, however, have a single,
tissue-specific focus and fail to reflect the complexity of whole eye
development. Here we demonstrate the generation from human induced pluripotent
stem cells of a self-formed ectodermal autonomous multi-zone (SEAM) of ocular
cells. In some respects the concentric SEAM mimics whole-eye development because 
cell location within different zones is indicative of lineage, spanning the
ocular surface ectoderm, lens, neuro-retina, and retinal pigment epithelium. It
thus represents a promising resource for new and ongoing studies of ocular
morphogenesis. The approach also has translational potential and to illustrate
this we show that cells isolated from the ocular surface ectodermal zone of the
SEAM can be sorted and expanded ex vivo to form a corneal epithelium that
recovers function in an experimentally induced animal model of corneal blindness.

Inhibitory neurons regulate the adaptation of neural circuits to sensory
experience, but the molecular mechanisms by which experience controls the
connectivity between different types of inhibitory neuron to regulate cortical
plasticity are largely unknown. Here we show that exposure of dark-housed mice to
light induces a gene program in cortical vasoactive intestinal peptide
(VIP)-expressing neurons that is markedly distinct from that induced in
excitatory neurons and other subtypes of inhibitory neuron. We identify Igf1 as
one of several activity-regulated genes that are specific to VIP neurons, and
demonstrate that IGF1 functions cell-autonomously in VIP neurons to increase
inhibitory synaptic input onto these neurons. Our findings further suggest that
in cortical VIP neurons, experience-dependent gene transcription regulates visual
acuity by activating the expression of IGF1, thus promoting the inhibition of
disinhibitory neurons and affecting inhibition onto cortical pyramidal neurons.

The repair and regeneration of tissues using endogenous stem cells represents an 
ultimate goal in regenerative medicine. To our knowledge, human lens regeneration
has not yet been demonstrated. Currently, the only treatment for cataracts, the
leading cause of blindness worldwide, is to extract the cataractous lens and
implant an artificial intraocular lens. However, this procedure poses notable
risks of complications. Here we isolate lens epithelial stem/progenitor cells
(LECs) in mammals and show that Pax6 and Bmi1 are required for LEC renewal. We
design a surgical method of cataract removal that preserves endogenous LECs and
achieves functional lens regeneration in rabbits and macaques, as well as in
human infants with cataracts. Our method differs conceptually from current
practice, as it preserves endogenous LECs and their natural environment
maximally, and regenerates lenses with visual function. Our approach demonstrates
a novel treatment strategy for cataracts and provides a new paradigm for tissue
regeneration using endogenous stem cells.

Hydrophobic signal sequences target secretory polypeptides to a
protein-conducting channel formed by a heterotrimeric membrane protein complex,
the prokaryotic SecY or eukaryotic Sec61 complex. How signal sequences are
recognized is poorly understood, particularly because they are diverse in
sequence and length. Structures of the inactive channel show that the largest
subunit, SecY or Sec61α, consists of two halves that form an hourglass-shaped
pore with a constriction in the middle of the membrane and a lateral gate that
faces lipid. The cytoplasmic funnel is empty, while the extracellular funnel is
filled with a plug domain. In bacteria, the SecY channel associates with the
translating ribosome in co-translational translocation, and with the SecA ATPase 
in post-translational translocation. How a translocating polypeptide inserts into
the channel is uncertain, as cryo-electron microscopy structures of the active
channel have a relatively low resolution (~10 Å) or are of insufficient quality. 
Here we report a crystal structure of the active channel, assembled from SecY
complex, the SecA ATPase, and a segment of a secretory protein fused into SecA.
The translocating protein segment inserts into the channel as a loop, displacing 
the plug domain. The hydrophobic core of the signal sequence forms a helix that
sits in a groove outside the lateral gate, while the following polypeptide
segment intercalates into the gate. The carboxy (C)-terminal section of the
polypeptide loop is located in the channel, surrounded by residues of the pore
ring. Thus, during translocation, the hydrophobic segments of signal sequences,
and probably bilayer-spanning domains of nascent membrane proteins, exit the
lateral gate and dock at a specific site that faces the lipid phase.

The conserved Piwi family of proteins and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have a
central role in genomic stability, which is inextricably linked to germ-cell
formation, by forming Piwi ribonucleoproteins (piRNPs) that silence transposable 
elements. In Drosophila melanogaster and other animals, primordial germ-cell
specification in the developing embryo is driven by maternal messenger RNAs and
proteins that assemble into specialized messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs)
localized in the germ (pole) plasm at the posterior of the oocyte. Maternal
piRNPs, especially those loaded on the Piwi protein Aubergine (Aub), are
transmitted to the germ plasm to initiate transposon silencing in the offspring
germ line. The transport of mRNAs to the oocyte by midoogenesis is an active,
microtubule-dependent process; mRNAs necessary for primordial germ-cell formation
are enriched in the germ plasm at late oogenesis via a diffusion and entrapment
mechanism, the molecular identity of which remains unknown. Aub is a central
component of germ granule RNPs, which house mRNAs in the germ plasm, and
interactions between Aub and Tudor are essential for the formation of germ
granules. Here we show that Aub-loaded piRNAs use partial base-pairing
characteristics of Argonaute RNPs to bind mRNAs randomly in Drosophila, acting as
an adhesive trap that captures mRNAs in the germ plasm, in a Tudor-dependent
manner. Notably, germ plasm mRNAs in drosophilids are generally longer and more
abundant than other mRNAs, suggesting that they provide more target sites for
piRNAs to promote their preferential tethering in germ granules. Thus, complexes 
containing Tudor, Aub piRNPs and mRNAs couple piRNA inheritance with germline
specification. Our findings reveal an unexpected function for piRNP complexes in 
mRNA trapping that may be generally relevant to the function of animal germ
granules.

Chiral nematic liquid crystals--otherwise referred to as cholesteric liquid
crystals (CLCs)--are self-organized helical superstructures that find practical
application in, for example, thermography, reflective displays, tuneable colour
filters and mirrorless lasing. Dynamic, remote and three-dimensional control over
the helical axis of CLCs is desirable, but challenging. For example, the
orientation of the helical axis relative to the substrate can be changed from
perpendicular to parallel by applying an alternating-current electric field, by
changing the anchoring conditions of the substrate, or by altering the topography
of the substrate's surface; separately, in-plane rotation of the helical axis
parallel to the substrate can be driven by a direct-current field. Here we report
three-dimensional manipulation of the helical axis of a CLC, together with
inversion of its handedness, achieved solely with a light stimulus. We use this
technique to carry out light-activated, wide-area, reversible two-dimensional
beam steering--previously accomplished using complex integrated systems and
optical phased arrays. During the three-dimensional manipulation by light, the
helical axis undergoes, in sequence, a reversible transition from perpendicular
to parallel, followed by in-plane rotation on the substrate surface. Such
reversible manipulation depends on experimental parameters such as cell
thickness, surface anchoring condition, and pitch length. Because there is no
thermal relaxation, the system can be driven either forwards or backwards from
any light-activated intermediate state. We also describe reversible photocontrol 
between a two-dimensional diffraction state, a one-dimensional diffraction state 
and a diffraction 'off' state in a bilayer cell.

Microquasars are stellar-mass black holes accreting matter from a companion star 
and ejecting plasma jets at almost the speed of light. They are analogues of
quasars that contain supermassive black holes of 10(6) to 10(10) solar masses.
Accretion in microquasars varies on much shorter timescales than in quasars and
occasionally produces exceptionally bright X-ray flares. How the flares are
produced is unclear, as is the mechanism for launching the relativistic jets and 
their composition. An emission line near 511 kiloelectronvolts has long been
sought in the emission spectrum of microquasars as evidence for the expected
electron-positron plasma. Transient high-energy spectral features have been
reported in two objects, but their positron interpretation remains contentious.
Here we report observations of γ-ray emission from the microquasar V404 Cygni
during a recent period of strong flaring activity. The emission spectrum around
511 kiloelectronvolts shows clear signatures of variable positron annihilation,
which implies a high rate of positron production. This supports the earlier
conjecture that microquasars may be the main sources of the electron-positron
plasma responsible for the bright diffuse emission of annihilation γ-rays in the 
bulge region of our Galaxy. Additionally, microquasars could be the origin of the
observed megaelectronvolt continuum excess in the inner Galaxy.

The Tharsis region is the largest volcanic complex on Mars and in the Solar
System. Young lava flows cover its surface (from the Amazonian period, less than 
3 billion years ago) but its growth started during the Noachian era (more than
3.7 billion years ago). Its position has induced a reorientation of the planet
with respect to its spin axis (true polar wander, TPW), which is responsible for 
the present equatorial position of the volcanic province. It has been suggested
that the Tharsis load on the lithosphere influenced the orientation of the
Noachian/Early Hesperian (more than 3.5 billion years ago) valley networks and
therefore that most of the topography of Tharsis was completed before fluvial
incision. Here we calculate the rotational figure of Mars (that is, its
equilibrium shape) and its surface topography before Tharsis formed, when the
spin axis of the planet was controlled by the difference in elevation between the
northern and southern hemispheres (hemispheric dichotomy). We show that the
observed directions of valley networks are also consistent with topographic
gradients in this configuration and thus do not require the presence of the
Tharsis load. Furthermore, the distribution of the valleys along a small circle
tilted with respect to the equator is found to correspond to a
southern-hemisphere latitudinal band in the pre-TPW geographical frame.
Preferential accumulation of ice or water in a south tropical band is predicted
by climate model simulations of early Mars applied to the pre-TPW topography. A
late growth of Tharsis, contemporaneous with valley incision, has several
implications for the early geological history of Mars, including the existence of
glacial environments near the locations of the pre-TPW poles of rotation, and a
possible link between volcanic outgassing from Tharsis and the stability of
liquid water at the surface of Mars.

Observing marine mammal (MM) populations continuously in time and space over the 
immense ocean areas they inhabit is challenging but essential for gathering an
unambiguous record of their distribution, as well as understanding their
behaviour and interaction with prey species. Here we use passive ocean acoustic
waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) in an important North Atlantic feeding ground
to instantaneously detect, localize and classify MM vocalizations from diverse
species over an approximately 100,000 km(2) region. More than eight species of
vocal MMs are found to spatially converge on fish spawning areas containing
massive densely populated herring shoals at night-time and diffuse herring
distributions during daytime. We find the vocal MMs divide the enormous fish prey
field into species-specific foraging areas with varying degrees of spatial
overlap, maintained for at least two weeks of the herring spawning period. The
recorded vocalization rates are diel (24 h)-dependent for all MM species, with
some significantly more vocal at night and others more vocal during the day. The 
four key baleen whale species of the region: fin, humpback, blue and minke have
vocalization rate trends that are highly correlated to trends in fish shoaling
density and to each other over the diel cycle. These results reveal the
temporospatial dynamics of combined multi-species MM foraging activities in the
vicinity of an extensive fish prey field that forms a massive ecological hotspot,
and would be unattainable with conventional methodologies. Understanding MM
behaviour and distributions is essential for management of marine ecosystems and 
for accessing anthropogenic impacts on these protected marine species.

The most recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa, which was unprecedented in
the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of
nations affected, highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available 
antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease
(EVD) or sequelae. No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory
approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a
novel small molecule GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine
analogue, with antiviral activity against EBOV. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral
activity against multiple variants of EBOV and other filoviruses in cell-based
assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently
formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP 
acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension
assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous 
administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (half-life, 14 h) and distribution to
sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a
rhesus monkey model of EVD, once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg(-1)
GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and
protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating
clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were 
initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in
two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive
post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in
nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro
against other pathogenic RNA viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and
coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use. GS-5734 is amenable 
to large-scale manufacturing, and clinical studies investigating the drug safety 
and pharmacokinetics are ongoing.

Approximately one-quarter of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide released into the
atmosphere each year is absorbed by the global oceans, causing measurable
declines in surface ocean pH, carbonate ion concentration ([CO3(2-)]), and
saturation state of carbonate minerals (Ω). This process, referred to as ocean
acidification, represents a major threat to marine ecosystems, in particular
marine calcifiers such as oysters, crabs, and corals. Laboratory and field
studies have shown that calcification rates of many organisms decrease with
declining pH, [CO3(2-)], and Ω. Coral reefs are widely regarded as one of the
most vulnerable marine ecosystems to ocean acidification, in part because the
very architecture of the ecosystem is reliant on carbonate-secreting organisms.
Acidification-induced reductions in calcification are projected to shift coral
reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century. While
retrospective studies show large-scale declines in coral, and community,
calcification over recent decades, determining the contribution of ocean
acidification to these changes is difficult, if not impossible, owing to the
confounding effects of other environmental factors such as temperature. Here we
quantify the net calcification response of a coral reef flat to alkalinity
enrichment, and show that, when ocean chemistry is restored closer to
pre-industrial conditions, net community calcification increases. In providing
results from the first seawater chemistry manipulation experiment of a natural
coral reef community, we provide evidence that net community calcification is
depressed compared with values expected for pre-industrial conditions, indicating
that ocean acidification may already be impairing coral reef growth.

Structure, inhibition and regulation of two-pore channel TPC1 from Arabidopsis
thaliana.

Francisco, California 94158, USA.

Two-pore channels (TPCs) comprise a subfamily (TPC1-3) of eukaryotic voltage- and
ligand-gated cation channels with two non-equivalent tandem pore-forming subunits
that dimerize to form quasi-tetramers. Found in vacuolar or endolysosomal
membranes, they regulate the conductance of sodium and calcium ions,
intravesicular pH, trafficking and excitability. TPCs are activated by a decrease
in transmembrane potential and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations,
are inhibited by low luminal pH and calcium, and are regulated by
phosphorylation. Here we report the crystal structure of TPC1 from Arabidopsis
thaliana at 2.87 Å resolution as a basis for understanding ion permeation,
channel activation, the location of voltage-sensing domains and regulatory
ion-binding sites. We determined sites of phosphorylation in the amino-terminal
and carboxy-terminal domains that are positioned to allosterically modulate
cytoplasmic Ca(2+) activation. One of the two voltage-sensing domains (VSD2)
encodes voltage sensitivity and inhibition by luminal Ca(2+) and adopts a
conformation distinct from the activated state observed in structures of other
voltage-gated ion channels. The structure shows that potent pharmacophore
trans-Ned-19 (ref. 17) acts allosterically by clamping the pore domains to VSD2. 
In animals, Ned-19 prevents infection by Ebola virus and other filoviruses,
presumably by altering their fusion with the endolysosome and delivery of their
contents into the cytoplasm.

Directional control of tip-growing cells is essential for proper tissue
organization and cell-to-cell communication in animals and plants. In the sexual 
reproduction of flowering plants, the tip growth of the male gametophyte, the
pollen tube, is precisely guided by female cues to achieve fertilization. Several
female-secreted peptides have recently been identified as species-specific
attractants that directly control the direction of pollen tube growth. However,
the method by which pollen tubes precisely and promptly respond to the guidance
signal from their own species is unknown. Here we show that tip-localized
pollen-specific receptor-like kinase 6 (PRK6) with an extracellular leucine-rich 
repeat domain is an essential receptor for sensing of the LURE1 attractant
peptide in Arabidopsis thaliana under semi-in-vivo conditions, and is important
for ovule targeting in the pistil. PRK6 interacted with pollen-expressed ROPGEFs 
(Rho of plant guanine nucleotide-exchange factors), which are important for
pollen tube growth through activation of the signalling switch Rho GTPase ROP1
(refs 7, 8). PRK6 conferred responsiveness to AtLURE1 in pollen tubes of the
related species Capsella rubella. Furthermore, our genetic and physiological data
suggest that PRK6 signalling through ROPGEFs and sensing of AtLURE1 are achieved 
in cooperation with the other PRK family receptors, PRK1, PRK3 and PRK8. Notably,
the tip-focused PRK6 accumulated asymmetrically towards an external AtLURE1
source before reorientation of pollen tube tip growth. These results demonstrate 
that PRK6 acts as a key membrane receptor for external AtLURE1 attractants, and
recruits the core tip-growth machinery, including ROP signalling proteins. This
work provides insights into the orchestration of efficient pollen tube growth and
species-specific pollen tube attraction by multiple receptors during male-female 
communication.

The terrestrial biosphere can release or absorb the greenhouse gases, carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and therefore has an
important role in regulating atmospheric composition and climate. Anthropogenic
activities such as land-use change, agriculture and waste management have altered
terrestrial biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes, and the resulting increases in
methane and nitrous oxide emissions in particular can contribute to climate
change. The terrestrial biogenic fluxes of individual greenhouse gases have been 
studied extensively, but the net biogenic greenhouse gas balance resulting from
anthropogenic activities and its effect on the climate system remains uncertain. 
Here we use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of local flux
measurements, and process-based modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversions) 
approaches to quantify the global net biogenic greenhouse gas balance between
1981 and 2010 resulting from anthropogenic activities and its effect on the
climate system. We find that the cumulative warming capacity of concurrent
biogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions is a factor of about two larger than
the cooling effect resulting from the global land carbon dioxide uptake from 2001
to 2010. This results in a net positive cumulative impact of the three greenhouse
gases on the planetary energy budget, with a best estimate (in petagrams of CO2
equivalent per year) of 3.9 ± 3.8 (top down) and 5.4 ± 4.8 (bottom up) based on
the GWP100 metric (global warming potential on a 100-year time horizon). Our
findings suggest that a reduction in agricultural methane and nitrous oxide
emissions, particularly in Southern Asia, may help mitigate climate change.

Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as a feedstock for commodity synthesis is an
attractive means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and a possible
stepping-stone towards renewable synthetic fuels. A major impediment to
synthesizing compounds from CO2 is the difficulty of forming carbon-carbon (C-C) 
bonds efficiently: although CO2 reacts readily with carbon-centred nucleophiles, 
generating these intermediates requires high-energy reagents (such as highly
reducing metals or strong organic bases), carbon-heteroatom bonds or relatively
acidic carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds. These requirements negate the environmental
benefit of using CO2 as a substrate and limit the chemistry to low-volume
targets. Here we show that intermediate-temperature (200 to 350 degrees Celsius) 
molten salts containing caesium or potassium cations enable carbonate ions
(CO3(2-)) to deprotonate very weakly acidic C-H bonds (pKa > 40), generating
carbon-centred nucleophiles that react with CO2 to form carboxylates. To
illustrate a potential application, we use C-H carboxylation followed by
protonation to convert 2-furoic acid into furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA)--a
highly desirable bio-based feedstock with numerous applications, including the
synthesis of polyethylene furandicarboxylate (PEF), which is a potential
large-scale substitute for petroleum-derived polyethylene terephthalate (PET).
Since 2-furoic acid can readily be made from lignocellulose, CO3(2-)-promoted C-H
carboxylation thus reveals a way to transform inedible biomass and CO2 into a
valuable feedstock chemical. Our results provide a new strategy for using CO2 in 
the synthesis of multi-carbon compounds.

Majorana zero modes are quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems
that have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers.
They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast to the 
usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to be
performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding
operations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near
zero energy, with the departure from zero expected to be exponentially small as
the modes become spatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several
experiments have identified signatures of Majorana modes in nanowires with
proximity-induced superconductivity and atomic chains, with small amounts of mode
splitting potentially explained by hybridization of Majorana modes. Here, we use 
Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire segment with epitaxial
aluminium, which forms a proximity-induced superconducting Coulomb island (a
'Majorana island') that is isolated from normal-metal leads by tunnel barriers,
to measure the splitting of near-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe
exponential suppression of energy splitting with increasing wire length. For
short devices of a few hundred nanometres, sub-gap state energies oscillate as
the magnetic field is varied, as is expected for hybridized Majorana modes.
Splitting decreases by a factor of about ten for each half a micrometre of
increased wire length. For devices longer than about one micrometre, transport in
strong magnetic fields occurs through a zero-energy state that is energetically
isolated from a continuum, yielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance
peaks, consistent with teleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help to
explain the trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify
the scaling of topological protection with end-mode separation.

Since their discovery, giant viruses have revealed several unique features that
challenge the conventional definition of a virus, such as their large and complex
genomes, their infection by virophages and their presence of transferable short
element transpovirons. Here we investigate the sensitivity of mimivirus to
virophage infection in a collection of 59 viral strains and demonstrate lineage
specificity in the resistance of mimivirus to Zamilon, a unique virophage that
can infect lineages B and C of mimivirus but not lineage A. We hypothesized that 
mimiviruses harbour a defence mechanism resembling the clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system that is widely present
in bacteria and archaea. We performed de novo sequencing of 45 new mimivirus
strains and searched for sequences specific to Zamilon in a total of 60 mimivirus
genomes. We found that lineage A strains are resistant to Zamilon and contain the
insertion of a repeated Zamilon sequence within an operon, here named the
'mimivirus virophage resistance element' (MIMIVIRE). Further analyses of the
surrounding sequences showed that this locus is reminiscent of a defence
mechanism related to the CRISPR-Cas system. Silencing the repeated sequence and
the MIMIVIRE genes restores mimivirus susceptibility to Zamilon. The MIMIVIRE
proteins possess the typical functions (nuclease and helicase) involved in the
degradation of foreign nucleic acids. The viral defence system, MIMIVIRE,
represents a nucleic-acid-based immunity against virophage infection.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related 
death. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a large proportion of
the US population and is considered to be a metabolic predisposition to liver
cancer. However, the role of adaptive immune responses in NAFLD-promoted HCC is
largely unknown. Here we show, in mouse models and human samples, that
dysregulation of lipid metabolism in NAFLD causes a selective loss of
intrahepatic CD4(+) but not CD8(+) T lymphocytes, leading to accelerated
hepatocarcinogenesis. We also demonstrate that CD4(+) T lymphocytes have greater 
mitochondrial mass than CD8(+) T lymphocytes and generate higher levels of
mitochondrially derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Disruption of
mitochondrial function by linoleic acid, a fatty acid accumulated in NAFLD,
causes more oxidative damage than other free fatty acids such as palmitic acid,
and mediates selective loss of intrahepatic CD4(+) T lymphocytes. In vivo
blockade of ROS reversed NAFLD-induced hepatic CD4(+) T lymphocyte decrease and
delayed NAFLD-promoted HCC. Our results provide an unexpected link between lipid 
dysregulation and impaired anti-tumour surveillance.

Fast radio bursts are millisecond-duration astronomical radio pulses of unknown
physical origin that appear to come from extragalactic distances. Previous
follow-up observations have failed to find additional bursts at the same
dispersion measure (that is, the integrated column density of free electrons
between source and telescope) and sky position as the original detections. The
apparent non-repeating nature of these bursts has led to the suggestion that they
originate in cataclysmic events. Here we report observations of ten additional
bursts from the direction of the fast radio burst FRB 121102. These bursts have
dispersion measures and sky positions consistent with the original burst. This
unambiguously identifies FRB 121102 as repeating and demonstrates that its source
survives the energetic events that cause the bursts. Additionally, the bursts
from FRB 121102 show a wide range of spectral shapes that appear to be
predominantly intrinsic to the source and which vary on timescales of minutes or 
less. Although there may be multiple physical origins for the population of fast 
radio bursts, these repeat bursts with high dispersion measure and variable
spectra specifically seen from the direction of FRB 121102 support an origin in a
young, highly magnetized, extragalactic neutron star.

Identifying key molecules that launch regeneration has been a long-sought goal.
Multiple regenerative animals show an initial wound-associated proliferative
response that transits into sustained proliferation if a considerable portion of 
the body part has been removed. In the axolotl, appendage amputation initiates a 
round of wound-associated cell cycle induction followed by continued
proliferation that is dependent on nerve-derived signals. A wound-associated
molecule that triggers the initial proliferative response to launch regeneration 
has remained obscure. Here, using an expression cloning strategy followed by in
vivo gain- and loss-of-function assays, we identified axolotl MARCKS-like protein
(MLP) as an extracellularly released factor that induces the initial cell cycle
response during axolotl appendage regeneration. The identification of a
regeneration-initiating molecule opens the possibility of understanding how to
elicit regeneration in other animals.

How does an animal know where it is when it stops moving? Hippocampal place cells
fire at discrete locations as subjects traverse space, thereby providing an
explicit neural code for current location during locomotion. In contrast, during 
awake immobility, the hippocampus is thought to be dominated by neural firing
representing past and possible future experience. The question of whether and how
the hippocampus constructs a representation of current location in the absence of
locomotion has been unresolved. Here we report that a distinct population of
hippocampal neurons, located in the CA2 subregion, signals current location
during immobility, and does so in association with a previously unidentified
hippocampus-wide network pattern. In addition, signalling of location persists
into brief periods of desynchronization prevalent in slow-wave sleep. The
hippocampus thus generates a distinct representation of current location during
immobility, pointing to mnemonic processing specific to experience occurring in
the absence of locomotion.

Translation of messenger RNAs lacking a stop codon results in the addition of a
carboxy-terminal poly-lysine tract to the nascent polypeptide, causing ribosome
stalling. Non-stop proteins and other stalled nascent chains are recognized by
the ribosome quality control (RQC) machinery and targeted for proteasomal
degradation. Failure of this process leads to neurodegeneration by unknown
mechanisms. Here we show that deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p in yeast,
a key RQC component, causes stalled proteins to form detergent-resistant
aggregates and inclusions. Aggregation is dependent on a C-terminal
alanine/threonine tail that is added to stalled polypeptides by the RQC
component, Rqc2p. Formation of inclusions additionally requires the poly-lysine
tract present in non-stop proteins. The aggregates sequester multiple cytosolic
chaperones and thereby interfere with general protein quality control pathways.
These findings can explain the proteotoxicity of ribosome-stalled polypeptides
and demonstrate the essential role of the RQC in maintaining proteostasis.

Sex and recombination are pervasive throughout nature despite their substantial
costs. Understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain these phenomena is a
central challenge in biology. One longstanding hypothesis argues that sex is
beneficial because recombination speeds adaptation. Theory has proposed several
distinct population genetic mechanisms that could underlie this advantage. For
example, sex can promote the fixation of beneficial mutations either by
alleviating interference competition (the Fisher-Muller effect) or by separating 
them from deleterious load (the ruby in the rubbish effect). Previous experiments
confirm that sex can increase the rate of adaptation, but these studies did not
observe the evolutionary dynamics that drive this effect at the genomic level.
Here we present the first, to our knowledge, comparison between the
sequence-level dynamics of adaptation in experimental sexual and asexual
Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which allows us to identify the specific
mechanisms by which sex speeds adaptation. We find that sex alters the molecular 
signatures of evolution by changing the spectrum of mutations that fix, and
confirm theoretical predictions that it does so by alleviating clonal
interference. We also show that substantially deleterious mutations hitchhike to 
fixation in adapting asexual populations. In contrast, recombination prevents
such mutations from fixing. Our results demonstrate that sex both speeds
adaptation and alters its molecular signature by allowing natural selection to
more efficiently sort beneficial from deleterious mutations.

The pseudogap is a partial gap in the electronic density of states that opens in 
the normal (non-superconducting) state of cuprate superconductors and whose
origin is a long-standing puzzle. Its connection to the Mott insulator phase at
low doping (hole concentration, p) remains ambiguous and its relation to the
charge order that reconstructs the Fermi surface at intermediate doping is still 
unclear. Here we use measurements of the Hall coefficient in magnetic fields up
to 88 tesla to show that Fermi-surface reconstruction by charge order in the
cuprate YBa2Cu3Oy ends sharply at a critical doping p = 0.16 that is distinctly
lower than the pseudogap critical point p* = 0.19 (ref. 11). This shows that the 
pseudogap and charge order are separate phenomena. We find that the change in
carrier density n from n = 1 + p in the conventional metal at high doping (ref.
12) to n = p at low doping (ref. 13) starts at the pseudogap critical point. This
shows that the pseudogap and the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator are linked.

The identification of properties that contribute to the persistence and
resilience of ecosystems despite climate change constitutes a research priority
of global relevance. Here we present a novel, empirical approach to assess the
relative sensitivity of ecosystems to climate variability, one property of
resilience that builds on theoretical modelling work recognizing that systems
closer to critical thresholds respond more sensitively to external perturbations.
We develop a new metric, the vegetation sensitivity index, that identifies areas 
sensitive to climate variability over the past 14 years. The metric uses time
series data derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer
(MODIS) enhanced vegetation index, and three climatic variables that drive
vegetation productivity (air temperature, water availability and cloud cover).
Underlying the analysis is an autoregressive modelling approach used to identify 
climate drivers of vegetation productivity on monthly timescales, in addition to 
regions with memory effects and reduced response rates to external forcing. We
find ecologically sensitive regions with amplified responses to climate
variability in the Arctic tundra, parts of the boreal forest belt, the tropical
rainforest, alpine regions worldwide, steppe and prairie regions of central Asia 
and North and South America, the Caatinga deciduous forest in eastern South
America, and eastern areas of Australia. Our study provides a quantitative
methodology for assessing the relative response rate of ecosystems--be they
natural or with a strong anthropogenic signature--to environmental variability,
which is the first step towards addressing why some regions appear to be more
sensitive than others, and what impact this has on the resilience of ecosystem
service provision and human well-being.

Discovering pharmaceutical candidates is a resource-intensive enterprise that
frequently requires the parallel synthesis of hundreds or even thousands of
molecules. C-H bonds are present in almost all pharmaceutical agents.
Consequently, the development of selective, rapid and efficient methods for
converting these bonds into new chemical entities has the potential to streamline
pharmaceutical development. Saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycles (alicyclic
amines) feature prominently in pharmaceuticals, such as treatments for depression
(paroxetine, amitifadine), diabetes (gliclazide), leukaemia (alvocidib),
schizophrenia (risperidone, belaperidone), malaria (mefloquine) and nicotine
addiction (cytisine, varenicline). However, existing methods for the C-H
functionalization of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, particularly at sites
remote to nitrogen, remain extremely limited. Here we report a transannular
approach to selectively manipulate the C-H bonds of alicyclic amines at sites
remote to nitrogen. Our reaction uses the boat conformation of the substrates to 
achieve palladium-catalysed amine-directed conversion of C-H bonds to C-C bonds
on various alicyclic amine scaffolds. We demonstrate this approach by
synthesizing new derivatives of several bioactive molecules, including
varenicline.

Sexual reproduction requires recognition between the male and female gametes. In 
flowering plants, the immobile sperms are delivered to the ovule-enclosed female 
gametophyte by guided pollen tube growth. Although the female
gametophyte-secreted peptides have been identified to be the chemotactic
attractant to the pollen tube, the male receptor(s) is still unknown. Here we
identify a cell-surface receptor heteromer, MDIS1-MIK, on the pollen tube that
perceives female attractant LURE1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. MDIS1, MIK1 and MIK2
are plasma-membrane-localized receptor-like kinases with extracellular
leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular kinase domain. LURE1 specifically binds
the extracellular domains of MDIS1, MIK1 and MIK2, whereas mdis1 and mik1 mik2
mutant pollen tubes respond less sensitively to LURE1. Furthermore, LURE1
triggers dimerization of the receptors and activates the kinase activity of MIK1.
Importantly, transformation of AtMDIS1 to the sister species Capsella rubella can
partially break down the reproductive isolation barrier. Our findings reveal a
new mechanism of the male perception of the female attracting signals.

Two-pore channels (TPCs) contain two copies of a Shaker-like six-transmembrane
(6-TM) domain in each subunit and are ubiquitously expressed in both animals and 
plants as organellar cation channels. Here we present the crystal structure of a 
vacuolar two-pore channel from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtTPC1, which functions as a
homodimer. AtTPC1 activation requires both voltage and cytosolic Ca(2+). Ca(2+)
binding to the cytosolic EF-hand domain triggers conformational changes coupled
to the pair of pore-lining inner helices from the first 6-TM domains, whereas
membrane potential only activates the second voltage-sensing domain, the
conformational changes of which are coupled to the pair of inner helices from the
second 6-TM domains. Luminal Ca(2+) or Ba(2+) can modulate voltage activation by 
stabilizing the second voltage-sensing domain in the resting state and shift
voltage activation towards more positive potentials. Our Ba(2+)-bound AtTPC1
structure reveals a voltage sensor in the resting state, providing hitherto
unseen structural insight into the general voltage-gating mechanism among
voltage-gated channels.

HKU1 is a human betacoronavirus that causes mild yet prevalent respiratory
disease, and is related to the zoonotic SARS and MERS betacoronaviruses, which
have high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Cell tropism and host range is
determined in part by the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which binds cellular
receptors and mediates membrane fusion. As the largest known class I fusion
protein, its size and extensive glycosylation have hindered structural studies of
the full ectodomain, thus preventing a molecular understanding of its function
and limiting development of effective interventions. Here we present the 4.0 Å
resolution structure of the trimeric HKU1 S protein determined using
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. In the pre-fusion conformation, the
receptor-binding subunits, S1, rest above the fusion-mediating subunits, S2,
preventing their conformational rearrangement. Surprisingly, the S1 C-terminal
domains are interdigitated and form extensive quaternary interactions that
occlude surfaces known in other coronaviruses to bind protein receptors. These
features, along with the location of the two protease sites known to be important
for coronavirus entry, provide a structural basis to support a model of membrane 
fusion mediated by progressive S protein destabilization through receptor binding
and proteolytic cleavage. These studies should also serve as a foundation for the
structure-based design of betacoronavirus vaccine immunogens.

The March 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake was only the second giant (moment magnitude 
Mw ≥ 9.0) earthquake to occur in the last 50 years and is the most recent to be
recorded using modern geophysical techniques. Available data place
high-resolution constraints on the kinematics of earthquake rupture, which have
challenged prior knowledge about how much a fault can slip in a single earthquake
and the seismic potential of a partially coupled megathrust interface. But it is 
not clear what physical or structural characteristics controlled either the
rupture extent or the amplitude of slip in this earthquake. Here we use residual 
topography and gravity anomalies to constrain the geological structure of the
overthrusting (upper) plate offshore northeast Japan. These data reveal an abrupt
southwest-northeast-striking boundary in upper-plate structure, across which
gravity modelling indicates a south-to-north increase in the density of rocks
overlying the megathrust of 150-200 kilograms per cubic metre. We suggest that
this boundary represents the offshore continuation of the Median Tectonic Line,
which onshore juxtaposes geological terranes composed of granite batholiths (in
the north) and accretionary complexes (in the south). The megathrust north of the
Median Tectonic Line is interseismically locked, has a history of large
earthquakes (18 with Mw > 7 since 1896) and produced peak slip exceeding 40
metres in the Tohoku-oki earthquake. In contrast, the megathrust south of this
boundary has higher rates of interseismic creep, has not generated an earthquake 
with MJ > 7 (local magnitude estimated by the Japan Meteorological Agency) since 
1923, and experienced relatively minor (if any) co-seismic slip in 2011. We
propose that the structure and frictional properties of the overthrusting plate
control megathrust coupling and seismogenic behaviour in northeast Japan.

It is often thought that the ability to control reaction rates with an applied
electrical potential gradient is unique to redox systems. However, recent
theoretical studies suggest that oriented electric fields could affect the
outcomes of a range of chemical reactions, regardless of whether a redox system
is involved. This possibility arises because many formally covalent species can
be stabilized via minor charge-separated resonance contributors. When an applied 
electric field is aligned in such a way as to electrostatically stabilize one of 
these minor forms, the degree of resonance increases, resulting in the overall
stabilization of the molecule or transition state. This means that it should be
possible to manipulate the kinetics and thermodynamics of non-redox processes
using an external electric field, as long as the orientation of the approaching
reactants with respect to the field stimulus can be controlled. Here, we provide 
experimental evidence that the formation of carbon-carbon bonds is accelerated by
an electric field. We have designed a surface model system to probe the
Diels-Alder reaction, and coupled it with a scanning tunnelling microscopy
break-junction approach. This technique, performed at the single-molecule level, 
is perfectly suited to deliver an electric-field stimulus across approaching
reactants. We find a fivefold increase in the frequency of formation of
single-molecule junctions, resulting from the reaction that occurs when the
electric field is present and aligned so as to favour electron flow from the
dienophile to the diene. Our results are qualitatively consistent with those
predicted by quantum-chemical calculations in a theoretical model of this system,
and herald a new approach to chemical catalysis.

Cosmic rays are the highest-energy particles found in nature. Measurements of the
mass composition of cosmic rays with energies of 10(17)-10(18) electronvolts are 
essential to understanding whether they have galactic or extragalactic sources.
It has also been proposed that the astrophysical neutrino signal comes from
accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of these energies. Cosmic rays
initiate air showers--cascades of secondary particles in the atmosphere-and their
masses can be inferred from measurements of the atmospheric depth of the shower
maximum (Xmax; the depth of the air shower when it contains the most particles)
or of the composition of shower particles reaching the ground. Current
measurements have either high uncertainty, or a low duty cycle and a high energy 
threshold. Radio detection of cosmic rays is a rapidly developing technique for
determining Xmax (refs 10, 11) with a duty cycle of, in principle, nearly 100 per
cent. The radiation is generated by the separation of relativistic electrons and 
positrons in the geomagnetic field and a negative charge excess in the shower
front. Here we report radio measurements of Xmax with a mean uncertainty of 16
grams per square centimetre for air showers initiated by cosmic rays with
energies of 10(17)-10(17.5) electronvolts. This high resolution in Xmax enables
us to determine the mass spectrum of the cosmic rays: we find a mixed
composition, with a light-mass fraction (protons and helium nuclei) of about 80
per cent. Unless, contrary to current expectations, the extragalactic component
of cosmic rays contributes substantially to the total flux below 10(17.5)
electronvolts, our measurements indicate the existence of an additional galactic 
component, to account for the light composition that we measured in the
10(17)-10(17.5) electronvolt range.

Little is known about how pro-obesity diets regulate tissue stem and progenitor
cell function. Here we show that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity augments the
numbers and function of Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells of the mammalian intestine.
Mechanistically, a HFD induces a robust peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor delta (PPAR-δ) signature in intestinal stem cells and progenitor cells
(non-intestinal stem cells), and pharmacological activation of PPAR-δ
recapitulates the effects of a HFD on these cells. Like a HFD, ex vivo treatment 
of intestinal organoid cultures with fatty acid constituents of the HFD enhances 
the self-renewal potential of these organoid bodies in a PPAR-δ-dependent manner.
Notably, HFD- and agonist-activated PPAR-δ signalling endow organoid-initiating
capacity to progenitors, and enforced PPAR-δ signalling permits these progenitors
to form in vivo tumours after loss of the tumour suppressor Apc. These findings
highlight how diet-modulated PPAR-δ activation alters not only the function of
intestinal stem and progenitor cells, but also their capacity to initiate
tumours.

Contractile tails are composed of an inner tube wrapped by an outer sheath
assembled in an extended, metastable conformation that stores mechanical energy
necessary for its contraction. Contraction is used to propel the rigid inner tube
towards target cells for DNA or toxin delivery. Although recent studies have
revealed the structure of the contractile sheath of the type VI secretion system,
the mechanisms by which its polymerization is controlled and coordinated with the
assembly of the inner tube remain unknown. Here we show that the starfish-like
TssA dodecameric complex interacts with tube and sheath components. Fluorescence 
microscopy experiments in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli reveal that TssA
binds first to the type VI secretion system membrane core complex and then
initiates tail polymerization. TssA remains at the tip of the growing structure
and incorporates new tube and sheath blocks. On the basis of these results, we
propose that TssA primes and coordinates tail tube and sheath biogenesis.

The RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling pathway is frequently 
deregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer, often through KRAS activating
mutations. A single endogenous mutant Kras allele is sufficient to promote lung
tumour formation in mice but malignant progression requires additional genetic
alterations. We recently showed that advanced lung tumours from
Kras(G12D/+);p53-null mice frequently exhibit Kras(G12D) allelic enrichment
(Kras(G12D)/Kras(wild-type) > 1) (ref. 7), implying that mutant Kras copy gains
are positively selected during progression. Here we show, through a comprehensive
analysis of mutant Kras homozygous and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts
and lung cancer cells, that these genotypes are phenotypically distinct. In
particular, Kras(G12D/G12D) cells exhibit a glycolytic switch coupled to
increased channelling of glucose-derived metabolites into the tricarboxylic acid 
cycle and glutathione biosynthesis, resulting in enhanced glutathione-mediated
detoxification. This metabolic rewiring is recapitulated in mutant KRAS
homozygous non-small-cell lung cancer cells and in vivo, in spontaneous advanced 
murine lung tumours (which display a high frequency of Kras(G12D) copy gain), but
not in the corresponding early tumours (Kras(G12D) heterozygous). Finally, we
demonstrate that mutant Kras copy gain creates unique metabolic dependences that 
can be exploited to selectively target these aggressive mutant Kras tumours. Our 
data demonstrate that mutant Kras lung tumours are not a single disease but
rather a heterogeneous group comprising two classes of tumours with distinct
metabolic profiles, prognosis and therapeutic susceptibility, which can be
discriminated on the basis of their relative mutant allelic content. We also
provide the first, to our knowledge, in vivo evidence of metabolic rewiring
during lung cancer malignant progression.

Integrated genomic analysis of 456 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas identified
32 recurrently mutated genes that aggregate into 10 pathways: KRAS, TGF-β, WNT,
NOTCH, ROBO/SLIT signalling, G1/S transition, SWI-SNF, chromatin modification,
DNA repair and RNA processing. Expression analysis defined 4 subtypes: (1)
squamous; (2) pancreatic progenitor; (3) immunogenic; and (4) aberrantly
differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX) that correlate with histopathological
characteristics. Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations,
upregulation of the TP63∆N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of
pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis.
Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early
pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed
upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation,
exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2).
Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways
involved in acquired immune suppression. These data infer differences in the
molecular evolution of pancreatic cancer subtypes and identify opportunities for 
therapeutic development.

Controlling dropwise condensation is fundamental to water-harvesting systems,
desalination, thermal power generation, air conditioning, distillation towers,
and numerous other applications. For any of these, it is essential to design
surfaces that enable droplets to grow rapidly and to be shed as quickly as
possible. However, approaches based on microscale, nanoscale or molecular-scale
textures suffer from intrinsic trade-offs that make it difficult to optimize both
growth and transport at once. Here we present a conceptually different design
approach--based on principles derived from Namib desert beetles, cacti, and
pitcher plants--that synergistically combines these aspects of condensation and
substantially outperforms other synthetic surfaces. Inspired by an unconventional
interpretation of the role of the beetle's bumpy surface geometry in promoting
condensation, and using theoretical modelling, we show how to maximize vapour
diffusion fluxat the apex of convex millimetric bumps by optimizing the radius of
curvature and cross-sectional shape. Integrating this apex geometry with a
widening slope, analogous to cactus spines, directly couples facilitated droplet 
growth with fast directional transport, by creating a free-energy profile that
drives the droplet down the slope before its growth rate can decrease. This
coupling is further enhanced by a slippery, pitcher-plant-inspired nanocoating
that facilitates feedback between coalescence-driven growth and capillary-driven 
motion on the way down. Bumps that are rationally designed to integrate these
mechanisms are able to grow and transport large droplets even against gravity and
overcome the effect of an unfavourable temperature gradient. We further observe
an unprecedented sixfold-higher exponent of growth rate, faster onset, higher
steady-state turnover rate, and a greater volume of water collected compared to
other surfaces. We envision that this fundamental understanding and rational
design strategy can be applied to a wide range of water-harvesting and
phase-change heat-transfer applications.

Eukaryotic cells restrict protein synthesis under various stress conditions, by
inhibiting the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B is the 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eIF2, a heterotrimeric G protein
consisting of α-, β- and γ-subunits. eIF2B exchanges GDP for GTP on the γ-subunit
of eIF2 (eIF2γ), and is inhibited by stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α.
eIF2B is a heterodecameric complex of two copies each of the α-, β-, γ-, δ- and
ε-subunits; its α-, β- and δ-subunits constitute the regulatory subcomplex, while
the γ- and ε-subunits form the catalytic subcomplex. The three-dimensional
structure of the entire eIF2B complex has not been determined. Here we present
the crystal structure of Schizosaccharomyces pombe eIF2B with an unprecedented
subunit arrangement, in which the α2β2δ2 hexameric regulatory subcomplex binds
two γε dimeric catalytic subcomplexes on its opposite sides. A structure-based in
vitro analysis by a surface-scanning site-directed photo-cross-linking method
identified the eIF2α-binding and eIF2γ-binding interfaces, located far apart on
the regulatory and catalytic subcomplexes, respectively. The eIF2γ-binding
interface is located close to the conserved 'NF motif', which is important for
nucleotide exchange. A structural model was constructed for the complex of eIF2B 
with phosphorylated eIF2α, which binds to eIF2B more strongly than the
unphosphorylated form. These results indicate that the eIF2α phosphorylation
generates the 'nonproductive' eIF2-eIF2B complex, which prevents nucleotide
exchange on eIF2γ, and thus provide a structural framework for the eIF2B-mediated
mechanism of stress-induced translational control.

All Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts have outer membrane
proteins (OMPs) that perform many fundamental biological processes. The OMPs in
Gram-negative bacteria are inserted and folded into the outer membrane by the
β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM). The mechanism involved is poorly understood,
owing to the absence of a structure of the entire BAM complex. Here we report two
crystal structures of the Escherichia coli BAM complex in two distinct states: an
inward-open state and a lateral-open state. Our structures reveal that the five
polypeptide transport-associated domains of BamA form a ring architecture with
four associated lipoproteins, BamB-BamE, in the periplasm. Our structural,
functional studies and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that these
subunits rotate with respect to the integral membrane β-barrel of BamA to induce 
movement of the β-strands of the barrel and promote insertion of the nascent OMP.

Copper and zinc form an important group of hydroxycarbonate minerals that include
zincian malachite, aurichalcite, rosasite and the exceptionally rare and
unstable--and hence little known and largely ignored--georgeite. The first three 
of these minerals are widely used as catalyst precursors for the industrially
important methanol-synthesis and low-temperature water-gas shift (LTS) reactions,
with the choice of precursor phase strongly influencing the activity of the final
catalyst. The preferred phase is usually zincian malachite. This is prepared by a
co-precipitation method that involves the transient formation of georgeite; with 
few exceptions it uses sodium carbonate as the carbonate source, but this also
introduces sodium ions--a potential catalyst poison. Here we show that
supercritical antisolvent (SAS) precipitation using carbon dioxide (refs 13, 14),
a process that exploits the high diffusion rates and solvation power of
supercritical carbon dioxide to rapidly expand and supersaturate solutions, can
be used to prepare copper/zinc hydroxycarbonate precursors with low sodium
content. These include stable georgeite, which we find to be a precursor to
highly active methanol-synthesis and superior LTS catalysts. Our findings
highlight the value of advanced synthesis methods in accessing unusual mineral
phases, and show that there is room for exploring improvements to established
industrial catalysts.

The vertebrate brain is highly complex, but its evolutionary origin remains
elusive. Because of the absence of certain developmental domains generally marked
by the expression of regulatory genes, the embryonic brain of the lamprey, a
jawless vertebrate, had been regarded as representing a less complex, ancestral
state of the vertebrate brain. Specifically, the absence of a Hedgehog- and
Nkx2.1-positive domain in the lamprey subpallium was thought to be similar to
mouse mutants in which the suppression of Nkx2-1 leads to a loss of the medial
ganglionic eminence. Here we show that the brain of the inshore hagfish
(Eptatretus burgeri), another cyclostome group, develops domains equivalent to
the medial ganglionic eminence and rhombic lip, resembling the gnathostome brain.
Moreover, further investigation of lamprey larvae revealed that these domains are
also present, ruling out the possibility of convergent evolution between hagfish 
and gnathostomes. Thus, brain regionalization as seen in crown gnathostomes is
not an evolutionary innovation of this group, but dates back to the latest
vertebrate ancestor before the divergence of cyclostomes and gnathostomes more
than 500 million years ago.

Spontaneous emission of radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms by which
an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however, spontaneous
emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative relaxation
processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole and the
electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the rate of spontaneous
emission can be greatly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a resonant
cavity. This effect has since been used extensively to control the lifetime of
atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or optical
cavities, and is essential for the realization of high-efficiency single-photon
sources. Here we report the application of this idea to spins in solids. By
coupling donor spins in silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity with a high
quality factor and a small mode volume, we reach the regime in which spontaneous 
emission constitutes the dominant mechanism of spin relaxation. The relaxation
rate is increased by three orders of magnitude as the spins are tuned to the
cavity resonance, demonstrating that energy relaxation can be controlled on
demand. Our results provide a general way to initialize spin systems into their
ground state and therefore have applications in magnetic resonance and quantum
information processing. They also demonstrate that the coupling between the
magnetic dipole of a spin and the electromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the
point at which quantum fluctuations have a marked effect on the spin dynamics; as
such, they represent an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of 
individual spins to microwave photons.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the largest component of the autonomic
nervous system, with neuron numbers surpassing those present in the spinal cord. 
The ENS has been called the 'second brain' given its autonomy, remarkable
neurotransmitter diversity and complex cytoarchitecture. Defects in ENS
development are responsible for many human disorders including Hirschsprung
disease (HSCR). HSCR is caused by the developmental failure of ENS progenitors to
migrate into the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the distal colon. Human ENS
development remains poorly understood owing to the lack of an easily accessible
model system. Here we demonstrate the efficient derivation and isolation of ENS
progenitors from human pluripotent stem (PS) cells, and their further
differentiation into functional enteric neurons. ENS precursors derived in vitro 
are capable of targeted migration in the developing chick embryo and extensive
colonization of the adult mouse colon. The in vivo engraftment and migration of
human PS-cell-derived ENS precursors rescue disease-related mortality in HSCR
mice (Ednrb(s-l/s-l)), although the mechanism of action remains unclear. Finally,
EDNRB-null mutant ENS precursors enable modelling of HSCR-related migration
defects, and the identification of pepstatin A as a candidate therapeutic target.
Our study establishes the first, to our knowledge, human PS-cell-based platform
for the study of human ENS development, and presents cell- and drug-based
strategies for the treatment of HSCR.

The tremendous pandemic potential of coronaviruses was demonstrated twice in the 
past few decades by two global outbreaks of deadly pneumonia. Entry of
coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S,
which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions. S
also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of
neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S
trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 Å resolution by single particle cryo-electron
microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights
key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with
paramyxovirus F proteins, implicating mechanistic similarities and an
evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of
the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates
potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies
against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human
coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species
specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.

The origin of eukaryotes stands as a major conundrum in biology. Current evidence
indicates that the last eukaryotic common ancestor already possessed many
eukaryotic hallmarks, including a complex subcellular organization. In addition, 
the lack of evolutionary intermediates challenges the elucidation of the relative
order of emergence of eukaryotic traits. Mitochondria are ubiquitous organelles
derived from an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. Different hypotheses disagree 
on whether mitochondria were acquired early or late during eukaryogenesis.
Similarly, the nature and complexity of the receiving host are debated, with
models ranging from a simple prokaryotic host to an already complex
proto-eukaryote. Most competing scenarios can be roughly grouped into either
mito-early, which consider the driving force of eukaryogenesis to be
mitochondrial endosymbiosis into a simple host, or mito-late, which postulate
that a significant complexity predated mitochondrial endosymbiosis. Here we
provide evidence for late mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We use phylogenomics to
directly test whether proto-mitochondrial proteins were acquired earlier or later
than other proteins of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. We find that last
eukaryotic common ancestor protein families of alphaproteobacterial ancestry and 
of mitochondrial localization show the shortest phylogenetic distances to their
closest prokaryotic relatives, compared with proteins of different prokaryotic
origin or cellular localization. Altogether, our results shed new light on a
long-standing question and provide compelling support for the late acquisition of
mitochondria into a host that already had a proteome of chimaeric phylogenetic
origin. We argue that mitochondrial endosymbiosis was one of the ultimate steps
in eukaryogenesis and that it provided the definitive selective advantage to
mitochondria-bearing eukaryotes over less complex forms.

The variation in molar tooth size in humans and our closest relatives (hominins) 
has strongly influenced our view of human evolution. The reduction in overall
size and disproportionate decrease in third molar size have been noted for over a
century, and have been attributed to reduced selection for large dentitions owing
to changes in diet or the acquisition of cooking. The systematic pattern of size 
variation along the tooth row has been described as a 'morphogenetic gradient' in
mammal, and more specifically hominin, teeth since Butler and Dahlberg. However, 
the underlying controls of tooth size have not been well understood, with
hypotheses ranging from morphogenetic fields to the clone theory. In this study
we address the following question: are there rules that govern how hominin tooth 
size evolves? Here we propose that the inhibitory cascade, an activator-inhibitor
mechanism that affects relative tooth size in mammals, produces the default
pattern of tooth sizes for all lower primary postcanine teeth (deciduous
premolars and permanent molars) in hominins. This configuration is also
equivalent to a morphogenetic gradient, finally pointing to a mechanism that can 
generate this gradient. The pattern of tooth size remains constant with absolute 
size in australopiths (including Ardipithecus, Australopithecus and
Paranthropus). However, in species of Homo, including modern humans, there is a
tight link between tooth proportions and absolute size such that a single
developmental parameter can explain both the relative and absolute sizes of
primary postcanine teeth. On the basis of the relationship of inhibitory cascade 
patterning with size, we can use the size at one tooth position to predict the
sizes of the remaining four primary postcanine teeth in the row for hominins. Our
study provides a development-based expectation to examine the evolution of the
unique proportions of human teeth.

Third-party punishment (TPP), in which unaffected observers punish selfishness,
promotes cooperation by deterring defection. But why should individuals choose to
bear the costs of punishing? We present a game theoretic model of TPP as a costly
signal of trustworthiness. Our model is based on individual differences in the
costs and/or benefits of being trustworthy. We argue that individuals for whom
trustworthiness is payoff-maximizing will find TPP to be less net costly (for
example, because mechanisms that incentivize some individuals to be trustworthy
also create benefits for deterring selfishness via TPP). We show that because of 
this relationship, it can be advantageous for individuals to punish selfishness
in order to signal that they are not selfish themselves. We then empirically
validate our model using economic game experiments. We show that TPP is indeed a 
signal of trustworthiness: third-party punishers are trusted more, and actually
behave in a more trustworthy way, than non-punishers. Furthermore, as predicted
by our model, introducing a more informative signal--the opportunity to help
directly--attenuates these signalling effects. When potential punishers have the 
chance to help, they are less likely to punish, and punishment is perceived as,
and actually is, a weaker signal of trustworthiness. Costly helping, in contrast,
is a strong and highly used signal even when TPP is also possible. Together, our 
model and experiments provide a formal reputational account of TPP, and
demonstrate how the costs of punishing may be recouped by the long-run benefits
of signalling one's trustworthiness.

The ocean has absorbed 41 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emitted as a
result of fossil fuel burning and cement manufacture. The magnitude and the
large-scale distribution of the ocean carbon sink is well quantified for recent
decades. In contrast, temporal changes in the oceanic carbon sink remain poorly
understood. It has proved difficult to distinguish between air-to-sea carbon flux
trends that are due to anthropogenic climate change and those due to internal
climate variability. Here we use a modelling approach that allows for this
separation, revealing how the ocean carbon sink may be expected to change
throughout this century in different oceanic regions. Our findings suggest that, 
owing to large internal climate variability, it is unlikely that changes in the
rate of anthropogenic carbon uptake can be directly observed in most oceanic
regions at present, but that this may become possible between 2020 and 2050 in
some regions.

In recent years, millisecond-duration radio signals originating in distant
galaxies appear to have been discovered in the so-called fast radio bursts. These
signals are dispersed according to a precise physical law and this dispersion is 
a key observable quantity, which, in tandem with a redshift measurement, can be
used for fundamental physical investigations. Every fast radio burst has a
dispersion measurement, but none before now have had a redshift measurement,
because of the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial coordinates. Here we
report the discovery of a fast radio burst and the identification of a fading
radio transient lasting ~6 days after the event, which we use to identify the
host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's redshift to be z = 0.492 ± 0.008. The
dispersion measure and redshift, in combination, provide a direct measurement of 
the cosmic density of ionized baryons in the intergalactic medium of
ΩIGM = 4.9 ± 1.3 per cent, in agreement with the expectation from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe, and including all of the so-called 'missing baryons'.
The ~6-day radio transient is largely consistent with the radio afterglow of a
short γ-ray burst, and its existence and timescale do not support progenitor
models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae. This contrasts with the
interpretation of another recently discovered fast radio burst, suggesting that
there are at least two classes of bursts.

It has been shown that Neanderthals contributed genetically to modern humans
outside Africa 47,000-65,000 years ago. Here we analyse the genomes of a
Neanderthal and a Denisovan from the Altai Mountains in Siberia together with the
sequences of chromosome 21 of two Neanderthals from Spain and Croatia. We find
that a population that diverged early from other modern humans in Africa
contributed genetically to the ancestors of Neanderthals from the Altai Mountains
roughly 100,000 years ago. By contrast, we do not detect such a genetic
contribution in the Denisovan or the two European Neanderthals. We conclude that 
in addition to later interbreeding events, the ancestors of Neanderthals from the
Altai Mountains and early modern humans met and interbred, possibly in the Near
East, many thousands of years earlier than previously thought.

Regulatory T cells hold promise as targets for therapeutic intervention in
autoimmunity, but approaches capable of expanding antigen-specific regulatory T
cells in vivo are currently not available. Here we show that systemic delivery of
nanoparticles coated with autoimmune-disease-relevant peptides bound to major
histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII) molecules triggers the generation
and expansion of antigen-specific regulatory CD4(+) T cell type 1 (TR1)-like
cells in different mouse models, including mice humanized with lymphocytes from
patients, leading to resolution of established autoimmune phenomena. Ten
pMHCII-based nanomedicines show similar biological effects, regardless of genetic
background, prevalence of the cognate T-cell population or MHC restriction. These
nanomedicines promote the differentiation of disease-primed autoreactive T cells 
into TR1-like cells, which in turn suppress autoantigen-loaded antigen-presenting
cells and drive the differentiation of cognate B cells into disease-suppressing
regulatory B cells, without compromising systemic immunity. pMHCII-based
nanomedicines thus represent a new class of drugs, potentially useful for
treating a broad spectrum of autoimmune conditions in a disease-specific manner.

Because autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders and patients
typically display symptoms before the age of three, one of the key questions in
autism research is whether the pathology is reversible in adults. Here we
investigate the developmental requirement of Shank3 in mice, a prominent
monogenic autism gene that is estimated to contribute to approximately 1% of all 
autism spectrum disorder cases. SHANK3 is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that
regulates synaptic development, function and plasticity by orchestrating the
assembly of postsynaptic density macromolecular signalling complex. Disruptions
of the Shank3 gene in mouse models have resulted in synaptic defects and
autistic-like behaviours including anxiety, social interaction deficits, and
repetitive behaviour. We generated a novel Shank3 conditional knock-in mouse
model, and show that re-expression of the Shank3 gene in adult mice led to
improvements in synaptic protein composition, spine density and neural function
in the striatum. We also provide behavioural evidence that certain behavioural
abnormalities including social interaction deficit and repetitive grooming
behaviour could be rescued, while anxiety and motor coordination deficit could
not be recovered in adulthood. Together, these results reveal the profound effect
of post-developmental activation of Shank3 expression on neural function, and
demonstrate a certain degree of continued plasticity in the adult diseased brain.

The orientation of cell division along the long axis of the interphase cell--the 
century-old Hertwig's rule--has profound roles in tissue proliferation,
morphogenesis, architecture and mechanics. In epithelial tissues, the shape of
the interphase cell is influenced by cell adhesion, mechanical stress, neighbour 
topology, and planar polarity pathways. At mitosis, epithelial cells usually
adopt a rounded shape to ensure faithful chromosome segregation and to promote
morphogenesis. The mechanisms underlying interphase cell shape sensing in tissues
are therefore unknown. Here we show that in Drosophila epithelia, tricellular
junctions (TCJs) localize force generators, pulling on astral microtubules and
orienting cell division via the Dynein-associated protein Mud independently of
the classical Pins/Gαi pathway. Moreover, as cells round up during mitosis, TCJs 
serve as spatial landmarks, encoding information about interphase cell shape
anisotropy to orient division in the rounded mitotic cell. Finally, experimental 
and simulation data show that shape and mechanical strain sensing by the TCJs
emerge from a general geometric property of TCJ distributions in epithelial
tissues. Thus, in addition to their function as epithelial barrier structures,
TCJs serve as polarity cues promoting geometry and mechanical sensing in
epithelial tissues.

Eukaryotic transcription activators stimulate the expression of specific sets of 
target genes through recruitment of co-activators such as the RNA polymerase
II-interacting Mediator complex. Aberrant function of transcription activators
has been implicated in several diseases. However, therapeutic targeting efforts
have been hampered by a lack of detailed molecular knowledge of the mechanisms of
gene activation by disease-associated transcription activators. We previously
identified an activator-targeted three-helix bundle KIX domain in the human MED15
Mediator subunit that is structurally conserved in Gal11/Med15 Mediator subunits 
in fungi. The Gal11/Med15 KIX domain engages pleiotropic drug resistance
transcription factor (Pdr1) orthologues, which are key regulators of the
multidrug resistance pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in the clinically
important human pathogen Candida glabrata. The prevalence of C. glabrata is
rising, partly owing to its low intrinsic susceptibility to azoles, the most
widely used antifungal agent. Drug-resistant clinical isolates of C. glabrata
most commonly contain point mutations in Pdr1 that render it constitutively
active, suggesting that this transcriptional activation pathway represents a
linchpin in C. glabrata multidrug resistance. Here we perform sequential
biochemical and in vivo high-throughput screens to identify small-molecule
inhibitors of the interaction of the C. glabrata Pdr1 activation domain with the 
C. glabrata Gal11A KIX domain. The lead compound (iKIX1) inhibits Pdr1-dependent 
gene activation and re-sensitizes drug-resistant C. glabrata to azole antifungals
in vitro and in animal models for disseminated and urinary tract C. glabrata
infection. Determining the NMR structure of the C. glabrata Gal11A KIX domain
provides a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of Pdr1 gene
activation and multidrug resistance inhibition by iKIX1. We have demonstrated the
feasibility of small-molecule targeting of a transcription factor-binding site in
Mediator as a novel therapeutic strategy in fungal infectious disease.

The mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) family of proteins (including MLL1-MLL4, SET1A 
and SET1B) specifically methylate histone 3 Lys4, and have pivotal roles in the
transcriptional regulation of genes involved in haematopoiesis and development.
The methyltransferase activity of MLL1, by itself severely compromised, is
stimulated by the three conserved factors WDR5, RBBP5 and ASH2L, which are shared
by all MLL family complexes. However, the molecular mechanism of how these
factors regulate the activity of MLL proteins still remains poorly understood.
Here we show that a minimized human RBBP5-ASH2L heterodimer is the structural
unit that interacts with and activates all MLL family histone methyltransferases.
Our structural, biochemical and computational analyses reveal a two-step
activation mechanism of MLL family proteins. These findings provide unprecedented
insights into the common theme and functional plasticity in complex assembly and 
activity regulation of MLL family methyltransferases, and also suggest a
universal regulation mechanism for most histone methyltransferases.

Tumour growth and metabolic adaptation may restrict the availability of certain
amino acids for protein synthesis. It has recently been shown that certain types 
of cancer cells depend on glycine, glutamine, leucine and serine metabolism to
proliferate and survive. In addition, successful therapies using
L-asparaginase-induced asparagine deprivation have been developed for acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a tailored detection system for measuring
restrictive amino acids in each tumour is currently not available. Here we
harness ribosome profiling for sensing restrictive amino acids, and develop
diricore, a procedure for differential ribosome measurements of codon reading. We
first demonstrate the functionality and constraints of diricore using metabolic
inhibitors and nutrient deprivation assays. Notably, treatment with
L-asparaginase elicited both specific diricore signals at asparagine codons and
high levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS). We then applied diricore to kidney
cancer and discover signals indicating restrictive proline. As for asparagine,
this observation was linked to high levels of PYCR1, a key enzyme in proline
production, suggesting a compensatory mechanism allowing tumour expansion.
Indeed, PYCR1 is induced by shortage of proline precursors, and its suppression
attenuated kidney cancer cell proliferation when proline was limiting. High PYCR1
is frequently observed in invasive breast carcinoma. In an in vivo model system
of this tumour, we also uncover signals indicating restrictive proline. We
further show that CRISPR-mediated knockout of PYCR1 impedes tumorigenic growth in
this system. Thus, diricore has the potential to reveal unknown amino acid
deficiencies, vulnerabilities that can be used to target key metabolic pathways
for cancer treatment.

Gene expression can be regulated post-transcriptionally through dynamic and
reversible RNA modifications. A recent noteworthy example is N(6)-methyladenosine
(m(6)A), which affects messenger RNA (mRNA) localization, stability, translation 
and splicing. Here we report on a new mRNA modification, N(1)-methyladenosine
(m(1)A), that occurs on thousands of different gene transcripts in eukaryotic
cells, from yeast to mammals, at an estimated average transcript stoichiometry of
20% in humans. Employing newly developed sequencing approaches, we show that
m(1)A is enriched around the start codon upstream of the first splice site: it
preferentially decorates more structured regions around canonical and alternative
translation initiation sites, is dynamic in response to physiological conditions,
and correlates positively with protein production. These unique features are
highly conserved in mouse and human cells, strongly indicating a functional role 
for m(1)A in promoting translation of methylated mRNA.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and the cas
(CRISPR-associated) operon form an RNA-based adaptive immune system against
foreign genetic elements in prokaryotes. Type I accounts for 95% of CRISPR
systems, and has been used to control gene expression and cell fate. During
CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided interference, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for
antiviral defence) facilitates the crRNA-guided invasion of double-stranded DNA
for complementary base-pairing with the target DNA strand while displacing the
non-target strand, forming an R-loop. Cas3, which has nuclease and helicase
activities, is subsequently recruited to degrade two DNA strands. A protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM) sequence flanking target DNA is crucial for self versus
foreign discrimination. Here we present the 2.45 Å crystal structure of
Escherichia coli Cascade bound to a foreign double-stranded DNA target. The
5'-ATG PAM is recognized in duplex form, from the minor groove side, by three
structural features in the Cascade Cse1 subunit. The promiscuity inherent to
minor groove DNA recognition rationalizes the observation that a single Cascade
complex can respond to several distinct PAM sequences. Optimal PAM recognition
coincides with wedge insertion, initiating directional target DNA strand
unwinding to allow segmented base-pairing with crRNA. The non-target strand is
guided along a parallel path 25 Å apart, and the R-loop structure is further
stabilized by locking this strand behind the Cse2 dimer. These observations
provide the structural basis for understanding the PAM-dependent directional
R-loop formation process.

Although the oxidation of water is efficiently catalysed by the oxygen-evolving
complex in photosystem II (refs 1 and 2), it remains one of the main bottlenecks 
when aiming for synthetic chemical fuel production powered by sunlight or
electricity. Consequently, the development of active and stable water oxidation
catalysts is crucial, with heterogeneous systems considered more suitable for
practical use and their homogeneous counterparts more suitable for targeted,
molecular-level design guided by mechanistic understanding. Research into the
mechanism of water oxidation has resulted in a range of synthetic molecular
catalysts, yet there remains much interest in systems that use abundant,
inexpensive and environmentally benign metals such as iron (the most abundant
transition metal in the Earth's crust and found in natural and synthetic
oxidation catalysts). Water oxidation catalysts based on mononuclear iron
complexes have been explored, but they often deactivate rapidly and exhibit
relatively low activities. Here we report a pentanuclear iron complex that
efficiently and robustly catalyses water oxidation with a turnover frequency of
1,900 per second, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of
other iron-based catalysts. Electrochemical analysis confirms the redox
flexibility of the system, characterized by six different oxidation states
between Fe(II)5 and Fe(III)5; the Fe(III)5 state is active for oxidizing water.
Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that the presence of adjacent active
sites facilitates O-O bond formation with a reaction barrier of less than ten
kilocalories per mole. Although the need for a high overpotential and the
inability to operate in water-rich solutions limit the practicality of the
present system, our findings clearly indicate that efficient water oxidation
catalysts based on iron complexes can be created by ensuring that the system has 
redox flexibility and contains adjacent water-activation sites.

Precision laser spectroscopy of cold and trapped molecular ions is a powerful
tool in fundamental physics--used, for example, in determining fundamental
constants, testing for their possible variation in the laboratory, and searching 
for a possible electric dipole moment of the electron. However, the absence of
cycling transitions in molecules poses a challenge for direct laser cooling of
the ions, and for controlling and detecting their quantum states. Previously used
state-detection techniques based on photodissociation or chemical reactions are
destructive and therefore inefficient, restricting the achievable resolution in
laser spectroscopy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-destructive detection
of the quantum state of a single trapped molecular ion through its strong Coulomb
coupling to a well controlled, co-trapped atomic ion. An algorithm based on a
state-dependent optical dipole force changes the internal state of the atom
according to the internal state of the molecule. We show that individual quantum 
states in the molecular ion can be distinguished by the strength of their
coupling to the optical dipole force. We also observe quantum jumps (induced by
black-body radiation) between rotational states of a single molecular ion. Using 
the detuning dependence of the state-detection signal, we implement a variant of 
quantum logic spectroscopy of a molecular resonance. Our state-detection
technique is relevant to a wide range of molecular ions, and could be applied to 
state-controlled quantum chemistry and to spectroscopic investigations of
molecules that serve as probes for interstellar clouds.

The non-equilibrium control of emergent phenomena in solids is an important
research frontier, encompassing effects such as the optical enhancement of
superconductivity. Nonlinear excitation of certain phonons in bilayer copper
oxides was recently shown to induce superconducting-like optical properties at
temperatures far greater than the superconducting transition temperature, Tc
(refs 4-6). This effect was accompanied by the disruption of competing
charge-density-wave correlations, which explained some but not all of the
experimental results. Here we report a similar phenomenon in a very different
compound, K3C60. By exciting metallic K3C60 with mid-infrared optical pulses, we 
induce a large increase in carrier mobility, accompanied by the opening of a gap 
in the optical conductivity. These same signatures are observed at equilibrium
when cooling metallic K3C60 below Tc (20 kelvin). Although optical techniques
alone cannot unequivocally identify non-equilibrium high-temperature
superconductivity, we propose this as a possible explanation of our results.

Integration of the reverse-transcribed viral DNA into the host genome is an
essential step in the life cycle of retroviruses. Retrovirus integrase catalyses 
insertions of both ends of the linear viral DNA into a host chromosome. Integrase
from HIV-1 and closely related retroviruses share the three-domain organization, 
consisting of a catalytic core domain flanked by amino- and carboxy-terminal
domains essential for the concerted integration reaction. Although structures of 
the tetrameric integrase-DNA complexes have been reported for integrase from
prototype foamy virus featuring an additional DNA-binding domain and longer
interdomain linkers, the architecture of a canonical three-domain integrase bound
to DNA remained elusive. Here we report a crystal structure of the three-domain
integrase from Rous sarcoma virus in complex with viral and target DNAs. The
structure shows an octameric assembly of integrase, in which a pair of integrase 
dimers engage viral DNA ends for catalysis while another pair of non-catalytic
integrase dimers bridge between the two viral DNA molecules and help capture
target DNA. The individual domains of the eight integrase molecules play varying 
roles to hold the complex together, making an extensive network of protein-DNA
and protein-protein contacts that show both conserved and distinct features
compared with those observed for prototype foamy virus integrase. Our work
highlights the diversity of retrovirus intasome assembly and provides insights
into the mechanisms of integration by HIV-1 and related retroviruses.

Retroviral integrase catalyses the integration of viral DNA into host target DNA,
which is an essential step in the life cycle of all retroviruses. Previous
structural characterization of integrase-viral DNA complexes, or intasomes, from 
the spumavirus prototype foamy virus revealed a functional integrase tetramer,
and it is generally believed that intasomes derived from other retroviral genera 
use tetrameric integrase. However, the intasomes of orthoretroviruses, which
include all known pathogenic species, have not been characterized structurally.
Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography,
we determine an unexpected octameric integrase architecture for the intasome of
the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumour virus. The structure is composed of two
core integrase dimers, which interact with the viral DNA ends and structurally
mimic the integrase tetramer of prototype foamy virus, and two flanking integrase
dimers that engage the core structure via their integrase carboxy-terminal
domains. Contrary to the belief that tetrameric integrase components are
sufficient to catalyse integration, the flanking integrase dimers were necessary 
for mouse mammary tumour virus integrase activity. The integrase octamer solves a
conundrum for betaretroviruses as well as alpharetroviruses by providing critical
carboxy-terminal domains to the intasome core that cannot be provided in cis
because of evolutionarily restrictive catalytic core domain-carboxy-terminal
domain linker regions. The octameric architecture of the intasome of mouse
mammary tumour virus provides new insight into the structural basis of retroviral
DNA integration.

Sex differences in physiology and disease susceptibility are commonly attributed 
to developmental and/or hormonal factors, but there is increasing realization
that cell-intrinsic mechanisms play important and persistent roles. Here we use
the Drosophila melanogaster intestine to investigate the nature and importance of
cellular sex in an adult somatic organ in vivo. We find that the adult intestinal
epithelium is a cellular mosaic of different sex differentiation pathways, and
displays extensive sex differences in expression of genes with roles in growth
and metabolism. Cell-specific reversals of the sexual identity of adult
intestinal stem cells uncovers the key role this identity has in controlling
organ size, reproductive plasticity and response to genetically induced tumours. 
Unlike previous examples of sexually dimorphic somatic stem cell activity, the
sex differences in intestinal stem cell behaviour arise from intrinsic mechanisms
that control cell cycle duration and involve a new doublesex- and
fruitless-independent branch of the sex differentiation pathway downstream of
transformer. Together, our findings indicate that the plasticity of an adult
somatic organ is reversibly controlled by its sexual identity, imparted by a new 
mechanism that may be active in more tissues than previously recognized.

The contribution of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets to sea level has 
increased in recent decades, largely owing to the thinning and retreat of outlet 
glaciers and ice streams. This dynamic loss is a serious concern, with some
modelling studies suggesting that the collapse of a major ice sheet could be
imminent or potentially underway in West Antarctica, but others predicting a more
limited response. A major problem is that observations used to initialize and
calibrate models typically span only a few decades, and, at the ice-sheet scale, 
it is unclear how the entire drainage network of ice streams evolves over longer 
timescales. This represents one of the largest sources of uncertainty when
predicting the contributions of ice sheets to sea-level rise. A key question is
whether ice streams might increase and sustain rates of mass loss over centuries 
or millennia, beyond those expected for a given ocean-climate forcing. Here we
reconstruct the activity of 117 ice streams that operated at various times during
deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (from about 22,000 to 7,000 years ago)
and show that as they activated and deactivated in different locations, their
overall number decreased, they occupied a progressively smaller percentage of the
ice sheet perimeter and their total discharge decreased. The underlying geology
and topography clearly influenced ice stream activity, but--at the ice-sheet
scale--their drainage network adjusted and was linked to changes in ice sheet
volume. It is unclear whether these findings can be directly translated to modern
ice sheets. However, contrary to the view that sees ice streams as unstable
entities that can accelerate ice-sheet deglaciation, we conclude that ice streams
exerted progressively less influence on ice sheet mass balance during the retreat
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

Resilience, a system's ability to adjust its activity to retain its basic
functionality when errors, failures and environmental changes occur, is a
defining property of many complex systems. Despite widespread consequences for
human health, the economy and the environment, events leading to loss of
resilience--from cascading failures in technological systems to mass extinctions 
in ecological networks--are rarely predictable and are often irreversible. These 
limitations are rooted in a theoretical gap: the current analytical framework of 
resilience is designed to treat low-dimensional models with a few interacting
components, and is unsuitable for multi-dimensional systems consisting of a large
number of components that interact through a complex network. Here we bridge this
theoretical gap by developing a set of analytical tools with which to identify
the natural control and state parameters of a multi-dimensional complex system,
helping us derive effective one-dimensional dynamics that accurately predict the 
system's resilience. The proposed analytical framework allows us systematically
to separate the roles of the system's dynamics and topology, collapsing the
behaviour of different networks onto a single universal resilience function. The 
analytical results unveil the network characteristics that can enhance or
diminish resilience, offering ways to prevent the collapse of ecological,
biological or economic systems, and guiding the design of technological systems
resilient to both internal failures and environmental changes.

Most near-Earth objects came from the asteroid belt and drifted via
non-gravitational thermal forces into resonant escape routes that, in turn,
pushed them onto planet-crossing orbits. Models predict that numerous asteroids
should be found on orbits that closely approach the Sun, but few have been seen. 
In addition, even though the near-Earth-object population in general is an even
mix of low-albedo (less than ten per cent of incident radiation is reflected) and
high-albedo (more than ten per cent of incident radiation is reflected)
asteroids, the characterized asteroids near the Sun typically have high albedos. 
Here we report a quantitative comparison of actual asteroid detections and a
near-Earth-object model (which accounts for observational selection effects). We 
conclude that the deficit of low-albedo objects near the Sun arises from the
super-catastrophic breakup (that is, almost complete disintegration) of a
substantial fraction of asteroids when they achieve perihelion distances of a few
tens of solar radii. The distance at which destruction occurs is greater for
smaller asteroids, and their temperatures during perihelion passages are too low 
for evaporation to explain their disappearance. Although both bright and dark
(high- and low-albedo) asteroids eventually break up, we find that low-albedo
asteroids are more likely to be destroyed farther from the Sun, which explains
the apparent excess of high-albedo near-Earth objects and suggests that
low-albedo asteroids break up more easily as a result of thermal effects.

The evolution of novel traits can involve many mutations scattered throughout the
genome. Detecting and validating such a suite of alleles, particularly if they
arose long ago, remains a key challenge in evolutionary genetics. Here we dissect
an evolutionary trade-off of unprecedented genetic complexity between
long-diverged species. When cultured in 1% glucose medium supplemented with
galactose, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not S. bayanus or other Saccharomyces
species, delayed commitment to galactose metabolism until glucose was exhausted. 
Promoters of seven galactose (GAL) metabolic genes from S. cerevisiae, when
introduced together into S. bayanus, largely recapitulated the delay phenotype in
1% glucose-galactose medium, and most had partial effects when tested in
isolation. Variation in GAL coding regions also contributed to the delay when
tested individually in 1% glucose-galactose medium. When combined, S. cerevisiae 
GAL coding regions gave rise to profound growth defects in the S. bayanus
background. In medium containing 2.5% glucose supplemented with galactose,
wild-type S. cerevisiae repressed GAL gene expression and had a robust growth
advantage relative to S. bayanus; transgenesis of S. cerevisiae GAL promoter
alleles or GAL coding regions was sufficient for partial reconstruction of these 
phenotypes. S. cerevisiae GAL genes thus encode a regulatory program of slow
induction and avid repression, and a fitness detriment during the
glucose-galactose transition but a benefit when glucose is in excess. Together,
these results make clear that genetic mapping of complex phenotypes is within
reach, even in deeply diverged species.

In multiple sclerosis, brain-reactive T cells invade the central nervous system
(CNS) and induce a self-destructive inflammatory process. T-cell infiltrates are 
not only found within the parenchyma and the meninges, but also in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes the entire CNS tissue. How the T cells
reach the CSF, their functionality, and whether they traffic between the CSF and 
other CNS compartments remains hypothetical. Here we show that effector T cells
enter the CSF from the leptomeninges during Lewis rat experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. While moving through the 
three-dimensional leptomeningeal network of collagen fibres in a random Brownian 
walk, T cells were flushed from the surface by the flow of the CSF. The detached 
cells displayed significantly lower activation levels compared to T cells from
the leptomeninges and CNS parenchyma. However, they did not represent a
specialized non-pathogenic cellular sub-fraction, as their gene expression
profile strongly resembled that of tissue-derived T cells and they fully retained
their encephalitogenic potential. T-cell detachment from the leptomeninges was
counteracted by integrins VLA-4 and LFA-1 binding to their respective ligands
produced by resident macrophages. Chemokine signalling via CCR5/CXCR3 and
antigenic stimulation of T cells in contact with the leptomeningeal macrophages
enforced their adhesiveness. T cells floating in the CSF were able to reattach to
the leptomeninges through steps reminiscent of vascular adhesion in CNS blood
vessels, and invade the parenchyma. The molecular/cellular conditions for T-cell 
reattachment were the same as the requirements for detachment from the
leptomeningeal milieu. Our data indicate that the leptomeninges represent a
checkpoint at which activated T cells are licensed to enter the CNS parenchyma
and non-activated T cells are preferentially released into the CSF, from where
they can reach areas of antigen availability and tissue damage.

Since the origins of agriculture, the scale of human cooperation and societal
complexity has dramatically expanded. This fact challenges standard evolutionary 
explanations of prosociality because well-studied mechanisms of cooperation based
on genetic relatedness, reciprocity and partner choice falter as people
increasingly engage in fleeting transactions with genetically unrelated strangers
in large anonymous groups. To explain this rapid expansion of prosociality,
researchers have proposed several mechanisms. Here we focus on one key
hypothesis: cognitive representations of gods as increasingly knowledgeable and
punitive, and who sanction violators of interpersonal social norms, foster and
sustain the expansion of cooperation, trust and fairness towards co-religionist
strangers. We tested this hypothesis using extensive ethnographic interviews and 
two behavioural games designed to measure impartial rule-following among people
(n = 591, observations = 35,400) from eight diverse communities from around the
world: (1) inland Tanna, Vanuatu; (2) coastal Tanna, Vanuatu; (3) Yasawa, Fiji;
(4) Lovu, Fiji; (5) Pesqueiro, Brazil; (6) Pointe aux Piments, Mauritius; (7) the
Tyva Republic (Siberia), Russia; and (8) Hadzaland, Tanzania. Participants
reported adherence to a wide array of world religious traditions including
Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as notably diverse local traditions,
including animism and ancestor worship. Holding a range of relevant variables
constant, the higher participants rated their moralistic gods as punitive and
knowledgeable about human thoughts and actions, the more coins they allocated to 
geographically distant co-religionist strangers relative to both themselves and
local co-religionists. Our results support the hypothesis that beliefs in
moralistic, punitive and knowing gods increase impartial behaviour towards
distant co-religionists, and therefore can contribute to the expansion of
prosociality.

Mammalian Wnt proteins are believed to act as short-range signals, yet have not
been previously visualized in vivo. Self-renewal, proliferation and
differentiation are coordinated along a putative Wnt gradient in the intestinal
crypt. Wnt3 is produced specifically by Paneth cells. Here we have generated an
epitope-tagged, functional Wnt3 knock-in allele. Wnt3 covers basolateral
membranes of neighbouring stem cells. In intestinal organoids, Wnt3-transfer
involves direct contact between Paneth cells and stem cells. Plasma membrane
localization requires surface expression of Frizzled receptors, which in turn is 
regulated by the transmembrane E3 ligases Rnf43/Znrf3 and their antagonists
Lgr4-5/R-spondin. By manipulating Wnt3 secretion and by arresting stem-cell
proliferation, we demonstrate that Wnt3 mainly travels away from its source in a 
cell-bound manner through cell division, and not through diffusion. We conclude
that stem-cell membranes constitute a reservoir for Wnt proteins, while Frizzled 
receptor turnover and 'plasma membrane dilution' through cell division shape the 
epithelial Wnt3 gradient.

Sighs are long, deep breaths expressing sadness, relief or exhaustion. Sighs also
occur spontaneously every few minutes to reinflate alveoli, and sighing increases
under hypoxia, stress, and certain psychiatric conditions. Here we use molecular,
genetic, and pharmacologic approaches to identify a peptidergic sigh control
circuit in murine brain. Small neural subpopulations in a key breathing control
centre, the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG),
express bombesin-like neuropeptide genes neuromedin B (Nmb) or gastrin-releasing 
peptide (Grp). These project to the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), the
respiratory rhythm generator, which expresses NMB and GRP receptors in
overlapping subsets of ~200 neurons. Introducing either neuropeptide into preBötC
or onto preBötC slices, induced sighing or in vitro sigh activity, whereas
elimination or inhibition of either receptor reduced basal sighing, and
inhibition of both abolished it. Ablating receptor-expressing neurons eliminated 
basal and hypoxia-induced sighing, but left breathing otherwise intact initially.
We propose that these overlapping peptidergic pathways comprise the core of a
sigh control circuit that integrates physiological and perhaps emotional input to
transform normal breaths into sighs.

U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP represents a substantial part of the spliceosome before
activation. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP at 3.7 Å resolution led to an essentially complete atomic
model comprising 30 proteins plus U4/U6 and U5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). The
structure reveals striking interweaving interactions of the protein and RNA
components, including extended polypeptides penetrating into subunit interfaces. 
The invariant ACAGAGA sequence of U6 snRNA, which base-pairs with the 5'-splice
site during catalytic activation, forms a hairpin stabilized by Dib1 and Prp8
while the adjacent nucleotides interact with the exon binding loop 1 of U5 snRNA.
Snu114 harbours GTP, but its putative catalytic histidine is held away from the
γ-phosphate by hydrogen bonding to a tyrosine in the amino-terminal domain of
Prp8. Mutation of this histidine to alanine has no detectable effect on yeast
growth. The structure provides important new insights into the spliceosome
activation process leading to the formation of the catalytic centre.

Inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes that drive the activation of
inflammatory caspases. So far, four inflammasomes involving NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4
and AIM2 have been described that recruit the common adaptor protein ASC to
activate caspase-1, leading to the secretion of mature IL-1β and IL-18 proteins. 
The NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several
acquired inflammatory diseases as well as cryopyrin-associated periodic fever
syndromes (CAPS) caused by inherited NLRP3 mutations. Potassium efflux is a
common step that is essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by many
stimuli. Despite extensive investigation, the molecular mechanism leading to
NLRP3 activation in response to potassium efflux remains unknown. Here we report 
the identification of NEK7, a member of the family of mammalian NIMA-related
kinases (NEK proteins), as an NLRP3-binding protein that acts downstream of
potassium efflux to regulate NLRP3 oligomerization and activation. In the absence
of NEK7, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release were abrogated in response to
signals that activate NLRP3, but not NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes.
NLRP3-activating stimuli promoted the NLRP3-NEK7 interaction in a process that
was dependent on potassium efflux. NLRP3 associated with the catalytic domain of 
NEK7, but the catalytic activity of NEK7 was shown to be dispensable for
activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated macrophages formed a
high-molecular-mass NLRP3-NEK7 complex, which, along with ASC oligomerization and
ASC speck formation, was abrogated in the absence of NEK7. NEK7 was required for 
macrophages containing the CAPS-associated NLRP3(R258W) activating mutation to
activate caspase-1. Mouse chimaeras reconstituted with wild-type, Nek7(-/-) or
Nlrp3(-/-) haematopoietic cells showed that NEK7 was required for NLRP3
inflammasome activation in vivo. These studies demonstrate that NEK7 is an
essential protein that acts downstream of potassium efflux to mediate NLRP3
inflammasome assembly and activation.

Seagrasses colonized the sea on at least three independent occasions to form the 
basis of one of the most productive and widespread coastal ecosystems on the
planet. Here we report the genome of Zostera marina (L.), the first, to our
knowledge, marine angiosperm to be fully sequenced. This reveals unique insights 
into the genomic losses and gains involved in achieving the structural and
physiological adaptations required for its marine lifestyle, arguably the most
severe habitat shift ever accomplished by flowering plants. Key angiosperm
innovations that were lost include the entire repertoire of stomatal genes, genes
involved in the synthesis of terpenoids and ethylene signalling, and genes for
ultraviolet protection and phytochromes for far-red sensing. Seagrasses have also
regained functions enabling them to adjust to full salinity. Their cell walls
contain all of the polysaccharides typical of land plants, but also contain
polyanionic, low-methylated pectins and sulfated galactans, a feature shared with
the cell walls of all macroalgae and that is important for ion homoeostasis,
nutrient uptake and O2/CO2 exchange through leaf epidermal cells. The Z. marina
genome resource will markedly advance a wide range of functional ecological
studies from adaptation of marine ecosystems under climate warming, to
unravelling the mechanisms of osmoregulation under high salinities that may
further inform our understanding of the evolution of salt tolerance in crop
plants.

Depleted uranium is a mildly radioactive waste product that is stockpiled
worldwide. The chemical reactivity of uranium complexes is well documented,
including the stoichiometric activation of small molecules of biological and
industrial interest such as H2O, CO2, CO, or N2 (refs 1 - 11), but catalytic
transformations with actinides remain underexplored in comparison to
transition-metal catalysis. For reduction of water to H2, complexes of low-valent
uranium show the highest potential, but are known to react violently and
uncontrollably forming stable bridging oxo or uranyl species. As a result, only a
few oxidations of uranium with water have been reported so far; all
stoichiometric. Catalytic H2 production, however, requires the reductive recovery
of the catalyst via a challenging cleavage of the uranium-bound oxygen-containing
ligand. Here we report the electrocatalytic water reduction observed with a
trisaryloxide U(III) complex [(((Ad,Me)ArO)3mes)U] (refs 18 and 19)--the first
homogeneous uranium catalyst for H2 production from H2O. The catalytic cycle
involves rare terminal U(IV)-OH and U(V)=O complexes, which have been isolated,
characterized, and proven to be integral parts of the catalytic mechanism. The
recognition of uranium compounds as potentially useful catalysts suggests new
applications for such light actinides. The development of uranium-based catalysts
provides new perspectives on nuclear waste management strategies, by suggesting
that mildly radioactive depleted uranium--an abundant waste product of the
nuclear power industry--could be a valuable resource.

Interfacing a single photon with another quantum system is a key capability in
modern quantum information science. It allows quantum states of matter, such as
spin states of atoms, atomic ensembles or solids, to be prepared and manipulated 
by photon counting and, in particular, to be distributed over long distances.
Such light-matter interfaces have become crucial to fundamental tests of quantum 
physics and realizations of quantum networks. Here we report non-classical
correlations between single photons and phonons--the quanta of mechanical
motion--from a nanomechanical resonator. We implement a full quantum protocol
involving initialization of the resonator in its quantum ground state of motion
and subsequent generation and read-out of correlated photon-phonon pairs. The
observed violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is clear evidence for the
non-classical nature of the mechanical state generated. Our results demonstrate
the availability of on-chip solid-state mechanical resonators as light-matter
quantum interfaces. The performance we achieved will enable studies of
macroscopic quantum phenomena as well as applications in quantum communication,
as quantum memories and as quantum transducers.

The proteasome is a multi-component protease complex responsible for regulating
key processes such as the cell cycle and antigen presentation. Compounds that
target the proteasome are potentially valuable tools for the treatment of
pathogens that depend on proteasome function for survival and replication. In
particular, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to be toxic for the malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum at all stages of its life cycle. Most compounds
that have been tested against the parasite also inhibit the mammalian proteasome,
resulting in toxicity that precludes their use as therapeutic agents. Therefore, 
better definition of the substrate specificity and structural properties of the
Plasmodium proteasome could enable the development of compounds with sufficient
selectivity to allow their use as anti-malarial agents. To accomplish this goal, 
here we use a substrate profiling method to uncover differences in the
specificities of the human and P. falciparum proteasome. We design inhibitors
based on amino-acid preferences specific to the parasite proteasome, and find
that they preferentially inhibit the β2-subunit. We determine the structure of
the P. falciparum 20S proteasome bound to the inhibitor using cryo-electron
microscopy and single-particle analysis, to a resolution of 3.6 Å. These data
reveal the unusually open P. falciparum β2 active site and provide valuable
information about active-site architecture that can be used to further refine
inhibitor design. Furthermore, consistent with the recent finding that the
proteasome is important for stress pathways associated with resistance of
artemisinin family anti-malarials, we observe growth inhibition synergism with
low doses of this β2-selective inhibitor in artemisinin-sensitive and -resistant 
parasites. Finally, we demonstrate that a parasite-selective inhibitor could be
used to attenuate parasite growth in vivo without appreciable toxicity to the
host. Thus, the Plasmodium proteasome is a chemically tractable target that could
be exploited by next-generation anti-malarial agents.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are arguably the most extensively characterized 
tissue stem cells. Since the identification of HSCs by prospective isolation,
complex multi-parameter flow cytometric isolation of phenotypic subsets has
facilitated studies on many aspects of HSC biology, including self-renewal,
differentiation, ageing, niche, and diversity. Here we demonstrate by unbiased
multi-step screening, identification of a single gene, homeobox B5 (Hoxb5, also
known as Hox-2.1), with expression in the bone marrow that is limited to
long-term (LT)-HSCs in mice. Using a mouse single-colour tri-mCherry reporter
driven by endogenous Hoxb5 regulation, we show that only the Hoxb5(+) HSCs
exhibit long-term reconstitution capacity after transplantation in primary
transplant recipients and, notably, in secondary recipients. Only 7-35% of
various previously defined immunophenotypic HSCs are LT-HSCs. Finally, by in situ
imaging of mouse bone marrow, we show that >94% of LT-HSCs (Hoxb5(+)) are
directly attached to VE-cadherin(+) cells, implicating the perivascular space as 
a near-homogenous location of LT-HSCs.

The palaeobiological record of 12 million to 7 million years ago (Ma) is crucial 
to the elucidation of African ape and human origins, but few fossil assemblages
of this period have been reported from sub-Saharan Africa. Since the 1970s, the
Chorora Formation, Ethiopia, has been widely considered to contain ~10.5 million 
year (Myr) old mammalian fossils. More recently, Chororapithecus abyssinicus, a
probable primitive member of the gorilla clade, was discovered from the
formation. Here we report new field observations and geochemical,
magnetostratigraphic and radioisotopic results that securely place the Chorora
Formation sediments to between ~9 and ~7 Ma. The C. abyssinicus fossils are
~8.0 Myr old, forming a revised age constraint of the human-gorilla split. Other 
Chorora fossils range in age from ~8.5 to 7 Ma and comprise the first sub-Saharan
mammalian assemblage that spans this period. These fossils suggest indigenous
African evolution of multiple mammalian lineages/groups between 10 and 7 Ma,
including a possible ancestral-descendent relationship between the ~9.8 Myr old
Nakalipithecus nakayamai and C. abyssinicus. The new chronology and fossils
suggest that faunal provinciality between eastern Africa and Eurasia had
intensified by ~9 Ma, with decreased faunal interchange thereafter. The Chorora
evidence supports the hypothesis of in situ African evolution of the
Gorilla-Pan-human clade, and is concordant with the deeper divergence estimates
of humans and great apes based on lower mutation rates of ~0.5 × 10(-9) per site 
per year (refs 13 - 15).

The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly
elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is
access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction
extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of
sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The
observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter
macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that 
crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their
heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the
crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give 
rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of
diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several
discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more
information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns
have long been observed--and are of interest as a source of information about the
dynamics of proteins--they have not been used for structure determination. Here
we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that
lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the
diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-ångström limit of measurable Bragg peaks,
which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope
conventionally determined at 4.5 ångströms as a constraint, we obtain a static
image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 ångströms. This result
shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been
supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a
method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables
model-free phasing.

Land-use change occurs nowhere more rapidly than in the tropics, where the
imbalance between deforestation and forest regrowth has large consequences for
the global carbon cycle. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate
of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by
climate, landscape, and prior land use. Here we analyse aboveground biomass
recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest
plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied
secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass
recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)),
corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the
uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time 
of 66 years to recover to 90% of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery 
after 20 years varied 11.3-fold (from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this
recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower
climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America,
which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration
potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize
forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as
seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in
humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.

No single mechanism can account for the full amplitude of past atmospheric carbon
dioxide (CO2) concentration variability over glacial-interglacial cycles. A
build-up of carbon in the deep ocean has been shown to have occurred during the
Last Glacial Maximum. However, the mechanisms responsible for the release of the 
deeply sequestered carbon to the atmosphere at deglaciation, and the relative
importance of deep ocean sequestration in regulating millennial-timescale
variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration before the Last Glacial Maximum, have
remained unclear. Here we present sedimentary redox-sensitive trace-metal records
from the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean that provide a reconstruction of
transient changes in deep ocean oxygenation and, by inference, respired carbon
storage throughout the last glacial cycle. Our data suggest that respired carbon 
was removed from the abyssal Southern Ocean during the Northern Hemisphere cold
phases of the deglaciation, when atmospheric CO2 concentration increased rapidly,
reflecting--at least in part--a combination of dwindling iron fertilization by
dust and enhanced deep ocean ventilation. Furthermore, our records show that the 
observed covariation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and abyssal Southern
Ocean oxygenation was maintained throughout most of the past 80,000 years. This
suggests that on millennial timescales deep ocean circulation and iron
fertilization in the Southern Ocean played a consistent role in modifying
atmospheric CO2 concentration.

Cellular senescence, a stress-induced irreversible growth arrest often
characterized by expression of p16(Ink4a) (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also
known as Cdkn2a) and a distinctive secretory phenotype, prevents the
proliferation of preneoplastic cells and has beneficial roles in tissue
remodelling during embryogenesis and wound healing. Senescent cells accumulate in
various tissues and organs over time, and have been speculated to have a role in 
ageing. To explore the physiological relevance and consequences of naturally
occurring senescent cells, here we use a previously established transgene,
INK-ATTAC, to induce apoptosis in p16(Ink4a)-expressing cells of wild-type mice
by injection of AP20187 twice a week starting at one year of age. We show that
compared to vehicle alone, AP20187 treatment extended median lifespan in both
male and female mice of two distinct genetic backgrounds. The clearance of
p16(Ink4a)-positive cells delayed tumorigenesis and attenuated age-related
deterioration of several organs without apparent side effects, including kidney, 
heart and fat, where clearance preserved the functionality of glomeruli,
cardio-protective KATP channels and adipocytes, respectively. Thus,
p16(Ink4a)-positive cells that accumulate during adulthood negatively influence
lifespan and promote age-dependent changes in several organs, and their
therapeutic removal may be an attractive approach to extend healthy lifespan.

The Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record,
responsible for over 28,599 cases and more than 11,299 deaths. Genome sequencing 
in viral outbreaks is desirable to characterize the infectious agent and
determine its evolutionary rate. Genome sequencing also allows the identification
of signatures of host adaptation, identification and monitoring of diagnostic
targets, and characterization of responses to vaccines and treatments. The Ebola 
virus (EBOV) genome substitution rate in the Makona strain has been estimated at 
between 0.87 × 10(-3) and 1.42 × 10(-3) mutations per site per year. This is
equivalent to 16-27 mutations in each genome, meaning that sequences diverge
rapidly enough to identify distinct sub-lineages during a prolonged epidemic.
Genome sequencing provides a high-resolution view of pathogen evolution and is
increasingly sought after for outbreak surveillance. Sequence data may be used to
guide control measures, but only if the results are generated quickly enough to
inform interventions. Genomic surveillance during the epidemic has been sporadic 
owing to a lack of local sequencing capacity coupled with practical difficulties 
transporting samples to remote sequencing facilities. To address this problem,
here we devise a genomic surveillance system that utilizes a novel nanopore DNA
sequencing instrument. In April 2015 this system was transported in standard
airline luggage to Guinea and used for real-time genomic surveillance of the
ongoing epidemic. We present sequence data and analysis of 142 EBOV samples
collected during the period March to October 2015. We were able to generate
results less than 24 h after receiving an Ebola-positive sample, with the
sequencing process taking as little as 15-60 min. We show that real-time genomic 
surveillance is possible in resource-limited settings and can be established
rapidly to monitor outbreaks.

The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks
(DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. Prdm9 is the only 
mammalian speciation gene yet identified and is responsible for sterility
phenotypes in male hybrids of certain mouse subspecies. To investigate PRDM9
binding and its role in fertility and meiotic recombination, we humanized the
DNA-binding domain of PRDM9 in C57BL/6 mice. This change repositions DSB hotspots
and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that alteration
of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the other allele 
at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with the degree to
which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it controls.
Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9 binding
associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of individual
hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the recombination
process. These findings reveal that subspecies-specific degradation of PRDM9
binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases asymmetric PRDM9
binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions, and strongly
support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility. Because such meiotic drive
occurs across mammals, PRDM9 may play a wider, yet transient, role in the early
stages of speciation.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are physiologically important transmembrane
signalling proteins that trigger intracellular responses upon binding of
extracellular ligands. Despite recent breakthroughs in GPCR crystallography, the 
details of ligand-induced signal transduction are not well understood owing to
missing dynamical information. In principle, such information can be provided by 
NMR, but so far only limited data of functional relevance on few side-chain sites
of eukaryotic GPCRs have been obtained. Here we show that receptor motions can be
followed at virtually any backbone site in a thermostabilized mutant of the
turkey β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR). Labelling with [(15)N]valine in a
eukaryotic expression system provides over twenty resolved resonances that report
on structure and dynamics in six ligand complexes and the apo form. The response 
to the various ligands is heterogeneous in the vicinity of the binding pocket,
but gets transformed into a homogeneous readout at the intracellular side of
helix 5 (TM5), which correlates linearly with ligand efficacy for the G protein
pathway. The effect of several pertinent, thermostabilizing point mutations was
assessed by reverting them to the native sequence. Whereas the response to
ligands remains largely unchanged, binding of the G protein mimetic nanobody NB80
and G protein activation are only observed when two conserved tyrosines (Y227 and
Y343) are restored. Binding of NB80 leads to very strong spectral changes
throughout the receptor, including the extracellular ligand entrance pocket. This
indicates that even the fully thermostabilized receptor undergoes activating
motions in TM5, but that the fully active state is only reached in presence of
Y227 and Y343 by stabilization with a G protein-like partner. The combined
analysis of chemical shift changes from the point mutations and ligand responses 
identifies crucial connections in the allosteric activation pathway, and presents
a general experimental method to delineate signal transmission networks at high
resolution in GPCRs.

Chronic opiate use induces opiate dependence, which is characterized by extremely
unpleasant physical and emotional feelings after drug use is terminated. Both the
rewarding effects of a drug and the desire to avoid withdrawal symptoms motivate 
continued drug use, and the nucleus accumbens is important for orchestrating both
processes. While multiple inputs to the nucleus accumbens regulate reward, little
is known about the nucleus accumbens circuitry underlying withdrawal. Here we
identify the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus as a prominent input to the 
nucleus accumbens mediating the expression of opiate-withdrawal-induced physical 
signs and aversive memory. Activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the
thalamus to nucleus accumbens pathway is necessary and sufficient to mediate
behavioural aversion. Selectively silencing this pathway abolishes aversive
symptoms in two different mouse models of opiate withdrawal. Chronic morphine
exposure selectively potentiates excitatory transmission between the
paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny
neurons via synaptic insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. Notably, in vivo 
optogenetic depotentiation restores normal transmission at these synapses and
robustly suppresses morphine withdrawal symptoms. This links morphine-evoked
pathway- and cell-type-specific plasticity in the paraventricular nucleus of the 
thalamus to nucleus accumbens circuit to opiate dependence, and suggests that
reprogramming this circuit holds promise for treating opiate addiction.

Ferrofluids exhibit unusual hydrodynamic effects owing to the magnetic nature of 
their constituents. As magnetization increases, a classical ferrofluid undergoes 
a Rosensweig instability and creates self-organized, ordered surface structures
or droplet crystals. Quantum ferrofluids such as Bose-Einstein condensates with
strong dipolar interactions also display superfluidity. The field of dipolar
quantum gases is motivated by the search for new phases of matter that break
continuous symmetries. The simultaneous breaking of continuous symmetries such as
the phase invariance in a superfluid state and the translational symmetry in a
crystal provides the basis for these new states of matter. However,
interaction-induced crystallization in a superfluid has not yet been observed.
Here we use in situ imaging to directly observe the spontaneous transition from
an unstructured superfluid to an ordered arrangement of droplets in an atomic
dysprosium Bose-Einstein condensate. By using a Feshbach resonance to control the
interparticle interactions, we induce a finite-wavelength instability and observe
discrete droplets in a triangular structure, the number of which grows as the
number of atoms increases. We find that these structured states are surprisingly 
long-lived and observe hysteretic behaviour, which is typical for a
crystallization process and in close analogy to the Rosensweig instability. Our
system exhibits both superfluidity and, as we show here, spontaneous
translational symmetry breaking. Although our observations do not probe
superfluidity in the structured states, if the droplets establish a common phase 
via weak links, then our system is a very good candidate for a supersolid ground 
state.

Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) are capable of accelerating charged particles to
very high energies in very compact structures. In theory, therefore, they offer
advantages over conventional, large-scale particle accelerators. However, the
energy gain in a single-stage LPA can be limited by laser diffraction, dephasing,
electron-beam loading and laser-energy depletion. The problem of laser
diffraction can be addressed by using laser-pulse guiding and preformed plasma
waveguides to maintain the required laser intensity over distances of many
Rayleigh lengths; dephasing can be mitigated by longitudinal tailoring of the
plasma density; and beam loading can be controlled by proper shaping of the
electron beam. To increase the beam energy further, it is necessary to tackle the
problem of the depletion of laser energy, by sequencing the accelerator into
stages, each powered by a separate laser pulse. Here, we present results from an 
experiment that demonstrates such staging. Two LPA stages were coupled over a
short distance (as is needed to preserve the average acceleration gradient) by a 
plasma mirror. Stable electron beams from a first LPA were focused to a
twenty-micrometre radius--by a discharge capillary-based active plasma lens--into
a second LPA, such that the beams interacted with the wakefield excited by a
separate laser. Staged acceleration by the wakefield of the second stage is
detected via an energy gain of 100 megaelectronvolts for a subset of the electron
beam. Changing the arrival time of the electron beam with respect to the
second-stage laser pulse allowed us to reconstruct the temporal wakefield
structure and to determine the plasma density. Our results indicate that the
fundamental limitation to energy gain presented by laser depletion can be
overcome by using staged acceleration, suggesting a way of reaching the electron 
energies required for collider applications.

The complex interplay of spin, charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom
provides a plethora of exotic phases and physical phenomena. In recent years,
complex spin topologies have emerged as a consequence of the electronic band
structure and the interplay between spin and spin-orbit coupling in materials.
Here we produce complex topologies of electrical polarization--namely,
nanometre-scale vortex-antivortex (that is, clockwise-anticlockwise) arrays that 
are reminiscent of rotational spin topologies--by making use of the competition
between charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in superlattices of
alternating lead titanate and strontium titanate layers. Atomic-scale mapping of 
the polar atomic displacements by scanning transmission electron microscopy
reveals the presence of long-range ordered vortex-antivortex arrays that exhibit 
nearly continuous polarization rotation. Phase-field modelling confirms that the 
vortex array is the low-energy state for a range of superlattice periods. Within 
this range, the large gradient energy from the vortex structure is
counterbalanced by the corresponding large reduction in overall electrostatic
energy (which would otherwise arise from polar discontinuities at the lead
titanate/strontium titanate interfaces) and the elastic energy associated with
epitaxial constraints and domain formation. These observations have implications 
for the creation of new states of matter (such as dipolar skyrmions, hedgehog
states) and associated phenomena in ferroic materials, such as electrically
controllable chirality.

Schizophrenia is a heritable brain illness with unknown pathogenic mechanisms.
Schizophrenia's strongest genetic association at a population level involves
variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and 
molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here 
we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse
alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles
generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each
common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to 
generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal
synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse
elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive
complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the 
reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.

The discovery of four new Xenoturbella species from deep waters of the eastern
Pacific Ocean is reported here. The genus and two nominal species were described 
from the west coast of Sweden, but their taxonomic placement remains unstable.
Limited evidence placed Xenoturbella with molluscs, but the tissues can be
contaminated with prey. They were then considered deuterostomes. Further taxon
sampling and analysis have grouped Xenoturbella with acoelomorphs
(=Xenacoelomorpha) as sister to all other Bilateria (=Nephrozoa), or placed
Xenacoelomorpha inside Deuterostomia with Ambulacraria
(Hemichordata + Echinodermata). Here we describe four new species of Xenoturbella
and reassess those hypotheses. A large species (>20 cm long) was found at
cold-water hydrocarbon seeps at 2,890 m depth in Monterey Canyon and at 1,722 m
in the Gulf of California (Mexico). A second large species (~10 cm long) also
occurred at 1,722 m in the Gulf of California. The third large species (~15 cm
long) was found at ~3,700 m depth near a newly discovered carbonate-hosted
hydrothermal vent in the Gulf of California. Finally, a small species (~2.5 cm
long), found near a whale carcass at 631 m depth in Monterey Submarine Canyon
(California), resembles the two nominal species from Sweden. Analysis of whole
mitochondrial genomes places the three larger species as a sister clade to the
smaller Atlantic and Pacific species. Phylogenomic analyses of transcriptomic
sequences support placement of Xenacoelomorpha as sister to Nephrozoa or
Protostomia.

The position of Xenacoelomorpha in the tree of life remains a major unresolved
question in the study of deep animal relationships. Xenacoelomorpha, comprising
Acoela, Nemertodermatida, and Xenoturbella, are bilaterally symmetrical marine
worms that lack several features common to most other bilaterians, for example an
anus, nephridia, and a circulatory system. Two conflicting hypotheses are under
debate: Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group to all remaining Bilateria
(= Nephrozoa, namely protostomes and deuterostomes) or is a clade inside
Deuterostomia. Thus, determining the phylogenetic position of this clade is
pivotal for understanding the early evolution of bilaterian features, or as a
case of drastic secondary loss of complexity. Here we show robust phylogenomic
support for Xenacoelomorpha as the sister taxon of Nephrozoa. Our phylogenetic
analyses, based on 11 novel xenacoelomorph transcriptomes and using different
models of evolution under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses,
strongly corroborate this result. Rigorous testing of 25 experimental data sets
designed to exclude data partitions and taxa potentially prone to reconstruction 
biases indicates that long-branch attraction, saturation, and missing data do not
influence these results. The sister group relationship between Nephrozoa and
Xenacoelomorpha supported by our phylogenomic analyses implies that the last
common ancestor of bilaterians was probably a benthic, ciliated acoelomate worm
with a single opening into an epithelial gut, and that excretory organs, coelomic
cavities, and nerve cords evolved after xenacoelomorphs separated from the stem
lineage of Nephrozoa.

There is considerable concern over declines in insect pollinator communities and 
potential impacts on the pollination of crops and wildflowers. Among the multiple
pressures facing pollinators, decreasing floral resources due to habitat loss and
degradation has been suggested as a key contributing factor. However, a lack of
quantitative data has hampered testing for historical changes in floral
resources. Here we show that overall floral rewards can be estimated at a
national scale by combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements. We
find evidence for substantial losses in nectar resources in England and Wales
between the 1930s and 1970s; however, total nectar provision in Great Britain as 
a whole had stabilized by 1978, and increased from 1998 to 2007. These findings
concur with trends in pollinator diversity, which declined in the mid-twentieth
century but stabilized more recently. The diversity of nectar sources declined
from 1978 to 1990 and thereafter in some habitats, with four plant species
accounting for over 50% of national nectar provision in 2007. Calcareous
grassland, broadleaved woodland and neutral grassland are the habitats that
produce the greatest amount of nectar per unit area from the most diverse
sources, whereas arable land is the poorest with respect to amount of nectar per 
unit area and diversity of nectar sources. Although agri-environment schemes add 
resources to arable landscapes, their national contribution is low. Owing to
their large area, improved grasslands could add substantially to national nectar 
provision if they were managed to increase floral resource provision. This
national-scale assessment of floral resource provision affords new insights into 
the links between plant and pollinator declines, and offers considerable
opportunities for conservation.

Dehydration of lawsonite could directly trigger earthquakes in subducting oceanic
crust.

Intermediate-depth earthquakes in cold subduction zones are observed within the
subducting oceanic crust, as well as the mantle. In contrast, intermediate-depth 
earthquakes in hot subduction zones predominantly occur just below the
Mohorovičić discontinuity. These observations have stimulated interest in
relationships between blueschist-facies metamorphism and seismicity, particularly
through dehydration reactions involving the mineral lawsonite. Here we conducted 
deformation experiments on lawsonite, while monitoring acoustic emissions, in a
Griggs-type deformation apparatus. The temperature was increased above the
thermal stability of lawsonite, while the sample was deforming, to test whether
the lawsonite dehydration reaction induces unstable fault slip. In contrast to
similar tests on antigorite, unstable fault slip (that is, stick-slip) occurred
during dehydration reactions in the lawsonite and acoustic emission signals were 
continuously observed. Microstructural observations indicate that strain is
highly localized along the fault (R1 and B shears), and that the fault surface
develops slickensides (very smooth fault surfaces polished by frictional
sliding). The unloading slope during the unstable slip follows the stiffness of
the apparatus at all experimental conditions, regardless of the strain rate and
temperature ramping rate. A thermomechanical scaling factor for the experiments
is within the range estimated for natural subduction zones, indicating the
potential for unstable frictional sliding within natural lawsonite layers.

The splitting of water photoelectrochemically into hydrogen and oxygen represents
a promising technology for converting solar energy to fuel. The main challenge is
to ensure that photogenerated holes efficiently oxidize water, which generally
requires modification of the photoanode with an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC)
to increase the photocurrent and reduce the onset potential. However, because
excess OEC material can hinder light absorption and decrease photoanode
performance, its deposition needs to be carefully controlled--yet it is unclear
which semiconductor surface sites give optimal improvement if targeted for OEC
deposition, and whether sites catalysing water oxidation also contribute to
competing charge-carrier recombination with photogenerated electrons. Surface
heterogeneity exacerbates these uncertainties, especially for nanostructured
photoanodes benefiting from small charge-carrier transport distances. Here we use
super-resolution imaging, operated in a charge-carrier-selective manner and with 
a spatiotemporal resolution of approximately 30 nanometres and 15 milliseconds,
to map both the electron- and hole-driven photoelectrocatalytic activities on
single titanium oxide nanorods. We then map, with sub-particle resolution (about 
390 nanometres), the photocurrent associated with water oxidation, and find that 
the most active sites for water oxidation are also the most important sites for
charge-carrier recombination. Site-selective deposition of an OEC, guided by the 
activity maps, improves the overall performance of a given nanorod--even though
more improvement in photocurrent efficiency correlates with less reduction in
onset potential (and vice versa) at the sub-particle level. Moreover, the optimal
catalyst deposition sites for photocurrent enhancement are the lower-activity
sites, and for onset potential reduction the optimal sites are the sites with
more positive onset potential, contrary to what is obtainable under typical
deposition conditions. These findings allow us to suggest an activity-based
strategy for rationally engineering catalyst-improved photoelectrodes, which
should be widely applicable because our measurements can be performed for many
different semiconductor and catalyst materials.

The time it takes a bound electron to respond to the electromagnetic force of
light sets a fundamental speed limit on the dynamic control of matter and
electromagnetic signal processing. Time-integrated measurements of the nonlinear 
refractive index of matter indicate that the nonlinear response of bound
electrons to optical fields is not instantaneous; however, a complete spectral
characterization of the nonlinear susceptibility tensors--which is essential to
deduce the temporal response of a medium to arbitrary driving forces using
spectral measurements--has not yet been achieved. With the establishment of
attosecond chronoscopy, the impulsive response of positive-energy electrons to
electromagnetic fields has been explored through ionization of atoms and solids
by an extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulse or by strong near-infrared fields.
However, none of the attosecond studies carried out so far have provided direct
access to the nonlinear response of bound electrons. Here we demonstrate that
intense optical attosecond pulses synthesized in the visible and nearby spectral 
ranges allow sub-femtosecond control and metrology of bound-electron dynamics.
Vacuum ultraviolet spectra emanating from krypton atoms, exposed to intense
waveform-controlled optical attosecond pulses, reveal a finite nonlinear response
time of bound electrons of up to 115 attoseconds, which is sensitive to and
controllable by the super-octave optical field. Our study could enable new
spectroscopies of bound electrons in atomic, molecular or lattice potentials of
solids, as well as light-based electronics operating on sub-femtosecond
timescales and at petahertz rates.

Cometary nuclei consist mostly of dust and water ice. Previous observations have 
found nuclei to be low-density and highly porous bodies, but have only moderately
constrained the range of allowed densities because of the measurement
uncertainties. Here we report the precise mass, bulk density, porosity and
internal structure of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on the basis
of its gravity field. The mass and gravity field are derived from measured
spacecraft velocity perturbations at fly-by distances between 10 and
100 kilometres. The gravitational point mass is GM = 666.2 ± 0.2 cubic metres per
second squared, giving a mass M = (9,982 ± 3) × 10(9) kilograms. Together with
the current estimate of the volume of the nucleus, the average bulk density of
the nucleus is 533 ± 6 kilograms per cubic metre. The nucleus appears to be a
low-density, highly porous (72-74 per cent) dusty body, similar to that of comet 
9P/Tempel 1. The most likely composition mix has approximately four times more
dust than ice by mass and two times more dust than ice by volume. We conclude
that the interior of the nucleus is homogeneous and constant in density on a
global scale without large voids. The high porosity seems to be an inherent
property of the nucleus material.

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are currently the leading candidates for
virus-based gene therapies because of their broad tissue tropism, non-pathogenic 
nature and low immunogenicity. They have been successfully used in clinical
trials to treat hereditary diseases such as haemophilia B (ref. 2), and have been
approved for treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in Europe. Considerable
efforts have been made to engineer AAV variants with novel and biomedically
valuable cell tropisms to allow efficacious systemic administration, yet basic
aspects of AAV cellular entry are still poorly understood. In particular, the
protein receptor(s) required for AAV entry after cell attachment remains unknown.
Here we use an unbiased genetic screen to identify proteins essential for AAV
serotype 2 (AAV2) infection in a haploid human cell line. The most significantly 
enriched gene of the screen encodes a previously uncharacterized type I
transmembrane protein, KIAA0319L (denoted hereafter as AAV receptor (AAVR)). We
characterize AAVR as a protein capable of rapid endocytosis from the plasma
membrane and trafficking to the trans-Golgi network. We show that AAVR directly
binds to AAV2 particles, and that anti-AAVR antibodies efficiently block AAV2
infection. Moreover, genetic ablation of AAVR renders a wide range of mammalian
cell types highly resistant to AAV2 infection. Notably, AAVR serves as a critical
host factor for all tested AAV serotypes. The importance of AAVR for in vivo gene
delivery is further highlighted by the robust resistance of Aavr(-/-) (also known
as Au040320(-/-) and Kiaa0319l(-/-)) mice to AAV infection. Collectively, our
data indicate that AAVR is a universal receptor involved in AAV infection.

Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant paediatric brain tumour, often inflicting
devastating consequences on the developing child. Genomic studies have revealed
four distinct molecular subgroups with divergent biology and clinical behaviour. 
An understanding of the regulatory circuitry governing the transcriptional
landscapes of medulloblastoma subgroups, and how this relates to their respective
developmental origins, is lacking. Here, using H3K27ac and BRD4 chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled with tissue-matched
DNA methylation and transcriptome data, we describe the active cis-regulatory
landscape across 28 primary medulloblastoma specimens. Analysis of differentially
regulated enhancers and super-enhancers reinforced inter-subgroup heterogeneity
and revealed novel, clinically relevant insights into medulloblastoma biology.
Computational reconstruction of core regulatory circuitry identified a master set
of transcription factors, validated by ChIP-seq, that is responsible for subgroup
divergence, and implicates candidate cells of origin for Group 4. Our integrated 
analysis of enhancer elements in a large series of primary tumour samples reveals
insights into cis-regulatory architecture, unrecognized dependencies, and
cellular origins.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers allow access to DNA for transcription factors
and the general transcription machinery, but whether mammalian chromatin
remodellers target specific nucleosomes to regulate transcription is unclear.
Here we present genome-wide remodeller-nucleosome interaction profiles for the
chromatin remodellers Chd1, Chd2, Chd4, Chd6, Chd8, Chd9, Brg1 and Ep400 in mouse
embryonic stem (ES) cells. These remodellers bind one or both full nucleosomes
that flank micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-defined nucleosome-free promoter regions 
(NFRs), where they separate divergent transcription. Surprisingly, large CpG-rich
NFRs that extend downstream of annotated transcriptional start sites are
nevertheless bound by non-nucleosomal or subnucleosomal histone variants (H3.3
and H2A.Z) and marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac modifications. RNA polymerase II
therefore navigates hundreds of base pairs of altered chromatin in the sense
direction before encountering an MNase-resistant nucleosome at the 3' end of the 
NFR. Transcriptome analysis after remodeller depletion reveals reciprocal
mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by remodellers. Whereas at active genes 
individual remodellers have either positive or negative roles via altering
nucleosome stability, at polycomb-enriched bivalent genes the same remodellers
act in an opposite manner. These findings indicate that remodellers target
specific nucleosomes at the edge of NFRs, where they regulate ES cell
transcriptional programs.

The process of ageing makes death increasingly likely, involving a random aspect 
that produces a wide distribution of lifespan even in homogeneous populations.
The study of this stochastic behaviour may link molecular mechanisms to the
ageing process that determines lifespan. Here, by collecting high-precision
mortality statistics from large populations, we observe that interventions as
diverse as changes in diet, temperature, exposure to oxidative stress, and
disruption of genes including the heat shock factor hsf-1, the hypoxia-inducible 
factor hif-1, and the insulin/IGF-1 pathway components daf-2, age-1, and daf-16
all alter lifespan distributions by an apparent stretching or shrinking of time. 
To produce such temporal scaling, each intervention must alter to the same extent
throughout adult life all physiological determinants of the risk of death.
Organismic ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans therefore appears to involve aspects 
of physiology that respond in concert to a diverse set of interventions. In this 
way, temporal scaling identifies a novel state variable, r(t), that governs the
risk of death and whose average decay dynamics involves a single effective rate
constant of ageing, kr. Interventions that produce temporal scaling influence
lifespan exclusively by altering kr. Such interventions, when applied transiently
even in early adulthood, temporarily alter kr with an attendant transient
increase or decrease in the rate of change in r and a permanent effect on
remaining lifespan. The existence of an organismal ageing dynamics that is
invariant across genetic and environmental contexts provides the basis for a new,
quantitative framework for evaluating the manner and extent to which specific
molecular processes contribute to the aspect of ageing that determines lifespan.

Lymphoid tissue is a key reservoir established by HIV-1 during acute infection.
It is a site associated with viral production, storage of viral particles in
immune complexes, and viral persistence. Although combinations of antiretroviral 
drugs usually suppress viral replication and reduce viral RNA to undetectable
levels in blood, it is unclear whether treatment fully suppresses viral
replication in lymphoid tissue reservoirs. Here we show that virus evolution and 
trafficking between tissue compartments continues in patients with undetectable
levels of virus in their bloodstream. We present a spatial and dynamic model of
persistent viral replication and spread that indicates why the development of
drug resistance is not a foregone conclusion under conditions in which drug
concentrations are insufficient to completely block virus replication. These data
provide new insights into the evolutionary and infection dynamics of the virus
population within the host, revealing that HIV-1 can continue to replicate and
replenish the viral reservoir despite potent antiretroviral therapy.

Intracellular aggregation of the human amyloid protein α-synuclein is causally
linked to Parkinson's disease. While the isolated protein is intrinsically
disordered, its native structure in mammalian cells is not known. Here we use
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy to derive atomic-resolution insights into the structure and dynamics
of α-synuclein in different mammalian cell types. We show that the disordered
nature of monomeric α-synuclein is stably preserved in non-neuronal and neuronal 
cells. Under physiological cell conditions, α-synuclein is amino-terminally
acetylated and adopts conformations that are more compact than when in buffer,
with residues of the aggregation-prone non-amyloid-β component (NAC) region
shielded from exposure to the cytoplasm, which presumably counteracts spontaneous
aggregation. These results establish that different types of crowded
intracellular environments do not inherently promote α-synuclein oligomerization 
and, more generally, that intrinsic structural disorder is sustainable in
mammalian cells.

Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has crucial roles in transcriptional
regulation and microRNA processing. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in 90% 
of patients with Rett syndrome, a severe developmental disorder with autistic
phenotypes. Duplications of MECP2-containing genomic segments cause the MECP2
duplication syndrome, which shares core symptoms with autism spectrum disorders. 
Although Mecp2-null mice recapitulate most developmental and behavioural defects 
seen in patients with Rett syndrome, it has been difficult to identify
autism-like behaviours in the mouse model of MeCP2 overexpression. Here we report
that lentivirus-based transgenic cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis)
expressing human MeCP2 in the brain exhibit autism-like behaviours and show
germline transmission of the transgene. Expression of the MECP2 transgene was
confirmed by western blotting and immunostaining of brain tissues of transgenic
monkeys. Genomic integration sites of the transgenes were characterized by a
deep-sequencing-based method. As compared to wild-type monkeys, MECP2 transgenic 
monkeys exhibited a higher frequency of repetitive circular locomotion and
increased stress responses, as measured by the threat-related anxiety and
defensive test. The transgenic monkeys showed less interaction with wild-type
monkeys within the same group, and also a reduced interaction time when paired
with other transgenic monkeys in social interaction tests. The cognitive
functions of the transgenic monkeys were largely normal in the Wisconsin general 
test apparatus, although some showed signs of stereotypic cognitive behaviours.
Notably, we succeeded in generating five F1 offspring of MECP2 transgenic monkeys
by intracytoplasmic sperm injection with sperm from one F0 transgenic monkey,
showing germline transmission and Mendelian segregation of several MECP2
transgenes in the F1 progeny. Moreover, F1 transgenic monkeys also showed reduced
social interactions when tested in pairs, as compared to wild-type monkeys of
similar age. Together, these results indicate the feasibility and reliability of 
using genetically engineered non-human primates to study brain disorders.

Many procedures in modern clinical medicine rely on the use of electronic
implants in treating conditions that range from acute coronary events to
traumatic injury. However, standard permanent electronic hardware acts as a nidus
for infection: bacteria form biofilms along percutaneous wires, or seed
haematogenously, with the potential to migrate within the body and to provoke
immune-mediated pathological tissue reactions. The associated surgical retrieval 
procedures, meanwhile, subject patients to the distress associated with
re-operation and expose them to additional complications. Here, we report
materials, device architectures, integration strategies, and in vivo
demonstrations in rats of implantable, multifunctional silicon sensors for the
brain, for which all of the constituent materials naturally resorb via hydrolysis
and/or metabolic action, eliminating the need for extraction. Continuous
monitoring of intracranial pressure and temperature illustrates functionality
essential to the treatment of traumatic brain injury; the measurement performance
of our resorbable devices compares favourably with that of non-resorbable
clinical standards. In our experiments, insulated percutaneous wires connect to
an externally mounted, miniaturized wireless potentiostat for data transmission. 
In a separate set-up, we connect a sensor to an implanted (but only partially
resorbable) data-communication system, proving the principle that there is no
need for any percutaneous wiring. The devices can be adapted to sense fluid flow,
motion, pH or thermal characteristics, in formats that are compatible with the
body's abdomen and extremities, as well as the deep brain, suggesting that the
sensors might meet many needs in clinical medicine.

The equatorial Pacific Ocean is one of the major high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll
regions in the global ocean. In such regions, the consumption of the available
macro-nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate is thought to be limited in part by
the low abundance of the critical micro-nutrient iron. Greater atmospheric dust
deposition could have fertilized the equatorial Pacific with iron during the last
ice age--the Last Glacial Period (LGP)--but the effect of increased ice-age dust 
fluxes on primary productivity in the equatorial Pacific remains uncertain. Here 
we present meridional transects of dust (derived from the (232)Th proxy),
phytoplankton productivity (using opal, (231)Pa/(230)Th and excess Ba), and the
degree of nitrate consumption (using foraminifera-bound δ(15)N) from six cores in
the central equatorial Pacific for the Holocene (0-10,000 years ago) and the LGP 
(17,000-27,000 years ago). We find that, although dust deposition in the central 
equatorial Pacific was two to three times greater in the LGP than in the
Holocene, productivity was the same or lower, and the degree of nitrate
consumption was the same. These biogeochemical findings suggest that the
relatively greater ice-age dust fluxes were not large enough to provide
substantial iron fertilization to the central equatorial Pacific. This may have
been because the absolute rate of dust deposition in the LGP (although greater
than the Holocene rate) was very low. The lower productivity coupled with
unchanged nitrate consumption suggests that the subsurface major nutrient
concentrations were lower in the central equatorial Pacific during the LGP. As
these nutrients are today dominantly sourced from the Subantarctic Zone of the
Southern Ocean, we propose that the central equatorial Pacific data are
consistent with more nutrient consumption in the Subantarctic Zone, possibly
owing to iron fertilization as a result of higher absolute dust fluxes in this
region. Thus, ice-age iron fertilization in the Subantarctic Zone would have
ultimately worked to lower, not raise, equatorial Pacific productivity.

Wearable sensor technologies are essential to the realization of personalized
medicine through continuously monitoring an individual's state of health.
Sampling human sweat, which is rich in physiological information, could enable
non-invasive monitoring. Previously reported sweat-based and other non-invasive
biosensors either can only monitor a single analyte at a time or lack on-site
signal processing circuitry and sensor calibration mechanisms for accurate
analysis of the physiological state. Given the complexity of sweat secretion,
simultaneous and multiplexed screening of target biomarkers is critical and
requires full system integration to ensure the accuracy of measurements. Here we 
present a mechanically flexible and fully integrated (that is, no external
analysis is needed) sensor array for multiplexed in situ perspiration analysis,
which simultaneously and selectively measures sweat metabolites (such as glucose 
and lactate) and electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium ions), as well as the
skin temperature (to calibrate the response of the sensors). Our work bridges the
technological gap between signal transduction, conditioning (amplification and
filtering), processing and wireless transmission in wearable biosensors by
merging plastic-based sensors that interface with the skin with silicon
integrated circuits consolidated on a flexible circuit board for complex signal
processing. This application could not have been realized using either of these
technologies alone owing to their respective inherent limitations. The wearable
system is used to measure the detailed sweat profile of human subjects engaged in
prolonged indoor and outdoor physical activities, and to make a real-time
assessment of the physiological state of the subjects. This platform enables a
wide range of personalized diagnostic and physiological monitoring applications.

Stars in clusters are thought to form in a single burst from a common progenitor 
cloud of molecular gas. However, massive, old 'globular' clusters--those with
ages greater than ten billion years and masses several hundred thousand times
that of the Sun--often harbour multiple stellar populations, indicating that more
than one star-forming event occurred during their lifetimes. Colliding stellar
winds from late-stage, asymptotic-giant-branch stars are often suggested to be
triggers of second-generation star formation. For this to occur, the initial
cluster masses need to be greater than a few million solar masses. Here we report
observations of three massive relatively young star clusters (1-2 billion years
old) in the Magellanic Clouds that show clear evidence of burst-like star
formation that occurred a few hundred million years after their initial formation
era. We show that such clusters could have accreted sufficient gas to form new
stars if they had orbited in their host galaxies' gaseous disks throughout the
period between their initial formation and the more recent bursts of star
formation. This process may eventually give rise to the ubiquitous multiple
stellar populations in globular clusters.

The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for 
artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of 
evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to
computer Go that uses 'value networks' to evaluate board positions and 'policy
networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel
combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement
learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural
networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search
programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce 
a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy
networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8%
winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go
champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has
defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat
previously thought to be at least a decade away.

The p53 pro-apoptotic tumour suppressor is mutated or functionally altered in
most cancers. In epithelial tumours induced by 'high-risk' mucosal human
papilloma viruses, including human cervical carcinoma and a growing number of
head-and-neck cancers, p53 is degraded by the viral oncoprotein E6 (ref. 2). In
this process, E6 binds to a short leucine (L)-rich LxxLL consensus sequence
within the cellular ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Subsequently, the E6/E6AP heterodimer 
recruits and degrades p53 (ref. 4). Neither E6 nor E6AP are separately able to
recruit p53 (refs 3, 5), and the precise mode of assembly of E6, E6AP and p53 is 
unknown. Here we solve the crystal structure of a ternary complex comprising
full-length human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E6, the LxxLL motif of E6AP
and the core domain of p53. The LxxLL motif of E6AP renders the conformation of
E6 competent for interaction with p53 by structuring a p53-binding cleft on E6.
Mutagenesis of critical positions at the E6-p53 interface disrupts p53
degradation. The E6-binding site of p53 is distal from previously described DNA- 
and protein-binding surfaces of the core domain. This suggests that, in
principle, E6 may avoid competition with cellular factors by targeting both free 
and bound p53 molecules. The E6/E6AP/p53 complex represents a prototype of viral 
hijacking of both the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway and the p53 
tumour suppressor pathway. The present structure provides a framework for the
design of inhibitory therapeutic strategies against oncogenesis mediated by human
papilloma virus.

Bacteria express many small RNAs for which the regulatory roles in pathogenesis
have remained poorly understood due to a paucity of robust phenotypes in standard
virulence assays. Here we use a generic 'dual RNA-seq' approach to profile RNA
expression simultaneously in pathogen and host during Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium infection and reveal the molecular impact of bacterial
riboregulators. We identify a PhoP-activated small RNA, PinT, which upon
bacterial internalization temporally controls the expression of both
invasion-associated effectors and virulence genes required for intracellular
survival. This riboregulatory activity causes pervasive changes in coding and
noncoding transcripts of the host. Interspecies correlation analysis links PinT
to host cell JAK-STAT signalling, and we identify infection-specific alterations 
in multiple long noncoding RNAs. Our study provides a paradigm for a sensitive
RNA-based analysis of intracellular bacterial pathogens and their hosts without
physical separation, as well as a new discovery route for hidden functions of
pathogen genes.

Lithium-ion batteries suffer severe power loss at temperatures below zero degrees
Celsius, limiting their use in applications such as electric cars in cold
climates and high-altitude drones. The practical consequences of such power loss 
are the need for larger, more expensive battery packs to perform engine cold
cranking, slow charging in cold weather, restricted regenerative braking, and
reduction of vehicle cruise range by as much as 40 per cent. Previous attempts to
improve the low-temperature performance of lithium-ion batteries have focused on 
developing additives to improve the low-temperature behaviour of electrolytes,
and on externally heating and insulating the cells. Here we report a lithium-ion 
battery structure, the 'all-climate battery' cell, that heats itself up from
below zero degrees Celsius without requiring external heating devices or
electrolyte additives. The self-heating mechanism creates an electrochemical
interface that is favourable for high discharge/charge power. We show that the
internal warm-up of such a cell to zero degrees Celsius occurs within 20 seconds 
at minus 20 degrees Celsius and within 30 seconds at minus 30 degrees Celsius,
consuming only 3.8 per cent and 5.5 per cent of cell capacity, respectively. The 
self-heated all-climate battery cell yields a discharge/regeneration power of
1,061/1,425 watts per kilogram at a 50 per cent state of charge and at minus 30
degrees Celsius, delivering 6.4-12.3 times the power of state-of-the-art
lithium-ion cells. We expect the all-climate battery to enable engine stop-start 
technology capable of saving 5-10 per cent of the fuel for 80 million new
vehicles manufactured every year. Given that only a small fraction of the battery
energy is used for self-heating, we envisage that the all-climate battery cell
may also prove useful for plug-in electric vehicles, robotics and space
exploration applications.

Global temperature targets, such as the widely accepted limit of an increase
above pre-industrial temperatures of two degrees Celsius, may fail to communicate
the urgency of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The translation of CO2
emissions into regional- and impact-related climate targets could be more
powerful because such targets are more directly aligned with individual national 
interests. We illustrate this approach using regional changes in extreme
temperatures and precipitation. These scale robustly with global temperature
across scenarios, and thus with cumulative CO2 emissions. This is particularly
relevant for changes in regional extreme temperatures on land, which are much
greater than changes in the associated global mean.

RNA polymerase (Pol) II produces messenger RNA during transcription of
protein-coding genes in all eukaryotic cells. The Pol II structure is known at
high resolution from X-ray crystallography for two yeast species. Structural
studies of mammalian Pol II, however, remain limited to low-resolution electron
microscopy analysis of human Pol II and its complexes with various proteins. Here
we report the 3.4 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of mammalian
Pol II in the form of a transcribing complex comprising DNA template and RNA
transcript. We use bovine Pol II, which is identical to the human enzyme except
for seven amino-acid residues. The obtained atomic model closely resembles its
yeast counterpart, but also reveals unknown features. Binding of nucleic acids to
the polymerase involves 'induced fit' of the mobile Pol II clamp and active
centre region. DNA downstream of the transcription bubble contacts a conserved
'TPSA motif' in the jaw domain of the Pol II subunit RPB5, an interaction that is
apparently already established during transcription initiation. Upstream DNA
emanates from the active centre cleft at an angle of approximately 105° with
respect to downstream DNA. This position of upstream DNA allows for binding of
the general transcription elongation factor DSIF (SPT4-SPT5) that we localize
over the active centre cleft in a conserved position on the clamp domain of Pol
II. Our results define the structure of mammalian Pol II in its functional state,
indicate that previous crystallographic analysis of yeast Pol II is relevant for 
understanding gene transcription in all eukaryotes, and provide a starting point 
for a mechanistic analysis of human transcription.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which sustain production of all blood cell
lineages, rely on glycolysis for ATP production, yet little attention has been
paid to the role of mitochondria. Here we show in mice that the short isoform of 
a critical regulator of HSCs, Prdm16 (refs 4, 5), induces mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a
protein involved in mitochondrial fusion and in tethering of mitochondria to the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression and deletion studies, including single-cell
transplantation assays, revealed that Mfn2 is specifically required for the
maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential, but not, or less so, for
the maintenance of myeloid-dominant HSCs. Mfn2 increased buffering of
intracellular Ca(2+), an effect mediated through its endoplasmic
reticulum-mitochondria tethering activity, thereby negatively regulating nuclear 
translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells
(Nfat). Nfat inhibition rescued the effects of Mfn2 deletion in HSCs,
demonstrating that negative regulation of Nfat is the prime downstream mechanism 
of Mfn2 in the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential.
Mitochondria therefore have an important role in HSCs. These findings provide a
mechanism underlying clonal heterogeneity among HSCs and may lead to the design
of approaches to bias HSC differentiation into desired lineages after
transplantation.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 have a
pivotal role in maintaining immunological self-tolerance; yet, excessive Treg
cell activities suppress anti-tumour immune responses. Compared to the resting
Treg (rTreg) cell phenotype in secondary lymphoid organs, Treg cells in
non-lymphoid tissues exhibit an activated Treg (aTreg) cell phenotype. However,
the function of aTreg cells and whether their generation can be manipulated are
largely unexplored. Here we show that the transcription factor Foxo1, previously 
demonstrated to promote Treg cell suppression of lymphoproliferative diseases,
has an unexpected function in inhibiting aTreg-cell-mediated immune tolerance in 
mice. We find that aTreg cells turned over at a slower rate than rTreg cells, but
were not locally maintained in tissues. aTreg cell differentiation was associated
with repression of Foxo1-dependent gene transcription, concomitant with reduced
Foxo1 expression, cytoplasmic localization and enhanced phosphorylation at the
Akt sites. Treg-cell-specific expression of an Akt-insensitive Foxo1 mutant
prevented downregulation of lymphoid organ homing molecules, and impeded Treg
cell homing to non-lymphoid organs, causing CD8(+) T-cell-mediated autoimmune
diseases. Compared to Treg cells from healthy tissues, tumour-infiltrating Treg
cells downregulated Foxo1 target genes more substantially. Expression of the
Foxo1 mutant at a lower dose was sufficient to deplete tumour-associated Treg
cells, activate effector CD8(+) T cells, and inhibit tumour growth without
inflicting autoimmunity. Thus, Foxo1 inactivation is essential for the migration 
of aTreg cells that have a crucial function in suppressing CD8(+) T-cell
responses; and the Foxo signalling pathway in Treg cells can be titrated to break
tumour immune tolerance preferentially.

Cellular immunity against viral infection and tumour cells depends on antigen
presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules.
Intracellular antigenic peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum
by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and then loaded onto 
the nascent MHC I molecules, which are exported to the cell surface and present
peptides to the immune system. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize non-self
peptides and program the infected or malignant cells for apoptosis. Defects in
TAP account for immunodeficiency and tumour development. To escape immune
surveillance, some viruses have evolved strategies either to downregulate TAP
expression or directly inhibit TAP activity. So far, neither the architecture of 
TAP nor the mechanism of viral inhibition has been elucidated at the structural
level. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TAP in
complex with its inhibitor ICP47, a small protein produced by the herpes simplex 
virus I. Here we show that the 12 transmembrane helices and 2 cytosolic
nucleotide-binding domains of the transporter adopt an inward-facing conformation
with the two nucleotide-binding domains separated. The viral inhibitor ICP47
forms a long helical hairpin, which plugs the translocation pathway of TAP from
the cytoplasmic side. Association of ICP47 precludes substrate binding and
prevents nucleotide-binding domain closure necessary for ATP hydrolysis. This
work illustrates a striking example of immune evasion by persistent viruses. By
blocking viral antigens from entering the endoplasmic reticulum, herpes simplex
virus is hidden from cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which may contribute to
establishing a lifelong infection in the host.

Ubiquitination is a central process affecting all facets of cellular signalling
and function. A critical step in ubiquitination is the transfer of ubiquitin from
an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to a substrate or a growing ubiquitin chain,
which is mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases. RING-type E3 ligases typically
facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 directly to the substrate. The
RING-between-RING (RBR) family of RING-type E3 ligases, however, breaks this
paradigm by forming a covalent intermediate with ubiquitin similarly to HECT-type
E3 ligases. The RBR family includes Parkin and HOIP, the central catalytic factor
of the LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex). While structural insights
into the RBR E3 ligases Parkin and HHARI in their overall auto-inhibited forms
are available, no structures exist of intact fully active RBR E3 ligases or any
of their complexes. Thus, the RBR mechanism of action has remained largely
unknown. Here we present the first structure, to our knowledge, of the fully
active human HOIP RBR in its transfer complex with an E2~ubiquitin conjugate,
which elucidates the intricate nature of RBR E3 ligases. The active HOIP RBR
adopts a conformation markedly different from that of auto-inhibited RBRs. HOIP
RBR binds the E2~ubiquitin conjugate in an elongated fashion, with the E2 and E3 
catalytic centres ideally aligned for ubiquitin transfer, which structurally both
requires and enables a HECT-like mechanism. In addition, three distinct
helix-IBR-fold motifs inherent to RBRs form ubiquitin-binding regions that engage
the activated ubiquitin of the E2~ubiquitin conjugate and, surprisingly, an
additional regulatory ubiquitin molecule. The features uncovered reveal critical 
states of the HOIP RBR E3 ligase cycle, and comparison with Parkin and HHARI
suggests a general mechanism for RBR E3 ligases.

The myelin sheaths wrapped around axons by oligodendrocytes are crucial for brain
function. In ischaemia myelin is damaged in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, abolishing
action potential propagation. This has been attributed to glutamate release
activating Ca(2+)-permeable N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Surprisingly, 
we now show that NMDA does not raise the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration
([Ca(2+)]i) in mature oligodendrocytes and that, although ischaemia evokes a
glutamate-triggered membrane current, this is generated by a rise of
extracellular [K(+)] and decrease of membrane K(+) conductance. Nevertheless,
ischaemia raises oligodendrocyte [Ca(2+)]i, [Mg(2+)]i and [H(+)]i, and buffering 
intracellular pH reduces the [Ca(2+)]i and [Mg(2+)]i increases, showing that
these are evoked by the rise of [H(+)]i. The H(+)-gated [Ca(2+)]i elevation is
mediated by channels with characteristics of TRPA1, being inhibited by ruthenium 
red, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, HC-030031, A967079 or TRPA1 knockout. TRPA1 block
reduces myelin damage in ischaemia. These data suggest that TRPA1-containing ion 
channels could be a therapeutic target in white matter ischaemia.

Measurement noise 100 times lower than the quantum-projection limit using
entangled atoms.

Quantum metrology uses quantum entanglement--correlations in the properties of
microscopic systems--to improve the statistical precision of physical
measurements. When measuring a signal, such as the phase shift of a light beam or
an atomic state, a prominent limitation to achievable precision arises from the
noise associated with the counting of uncorrelated probe particles. This noise,
commonly referred to as shot noise or projection noise, gives rise to the
standard quantum limit (SQL) to phase resolution. However, it can be mitigated
down to the fundamental Heisenberg limit by entangling the probe particles.
Despite considerable experimental progress in a variety of physical systems, a
question that persists is whether these methods can achieve performance levels
that compare favourably with optimized conventional (non-entangled) systems. Here
we demonstrate an approach that achieves unprecedented levels of metrological
improvement using half a million (87)Rb atoms in their 'clock' states. The
ensemble is 20.1 ± 0.3 decibels (100-fold) spin-squeezed via an
optical-cavity-based measurement. We directly resolve small microwave-induced
rotations 18.5 ± 0.3 decibels (70-fold) beyond the SQL. The single-shot phase
resolution of 147 microradians achieved by the apparatus is better than that
achieved by the best engineered cold atom sensors despite lower atom numbers. We 
infer entanglement of more than 680 ± 35 particles in the atomic ensemble.
Applications include atomic clocks, inertial sensors, and fundamental physics
experiments such as tests of general relativity or searches for electron electric
dipole moment. To this end, we demonstrate an atomic clock measurement with a
quantum enhancement of 10.5 ± 0.3 decibels (11-fold), limited by the phase noise 
of our microwave source.

CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing but can induce unwanted 
off-target mutations. Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target
effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect,
possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that
constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant
harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1
retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with >85% of
single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells. Notably, with sgRNAs targeted
to standard non-repetitive sequences, SpCas9-HF1 rendered all or nearly all
off-target events undetectable by genome-wide break capture and targeted
sequencing methods. Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority
of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with
SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to
wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications. More broadly, our
results suggest a general strategy for optimizing genome-wide specificities of
other CRISPR-RNA-guided nucleases.

The nature of inter-group relations among prehistoric hunter-gatherers remains
disputed, with arguments in favour and against the existence of warfare before
the development of sedentary societies. Here we report on a case of inter-group
violence towards a group of hunter-gatherers from Nataruk, west of Lake Turkana, 
which during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene period extended about 30 km
beyond its present-day shore. Ten of the twelve articulated skeletons found at
Nataruk show evidence of having died violently at the edge of a lagoon, into
which some of the bodies fell. The remains from Nataruk are unique, preserved by 
the particular conditions of the lagoon with no evidence of deliberate burial.
They offer a rare glimpse into the life and death of past foraging people, and
evidence that warfare was part of the repertoire of inter-group relations among
prehistoric hunter-gatherers.

Powering Earth's dynamo with magnesium precipitation from the core.

Earth's global magnetic field arises from vigorous convection within the liquid
outer core. Palaeomagnetic evidence reveals that the geodynamo has operated for
at least 3.4 billion years, which places constraints on Earth's formation and
evolution. Available power sources in standard models include compositional
convection (driven by the solidifying inner core's expulsion of light elements), 
thermal convection (from slow cooling), and perhaps heat from the decay of
radioactive isotopes. However, recent first-principles calculations and
diamond-anvil cell experiments indicate that the thermal conductivity of iron is 
two or three times larger than typically assumed in these models. This presents a
problem: a large increase in the conductive heat flux along the adiabat (due to
the higher conductivity of iron) implies that the inner core is young (less than 
one billion years old), but thermal convection and radiogenic heating alone may
not have been able to sustain the geodynamo during earlier epochs. Here we show
that the precipitation of magnesium-bearing minerals from the core could have
served as an alternative power source. Equilibration at high temperatures in the 
aftermath of giant impacts allows a small amount of magnesium (one or two weight 
per cent) to partition into the core while still producing the observed
abundances of siderophile elements in the mantle and avoiding an excess of
silicon and oxygen in the core. The transport of magnesium as oxide or silicate
from the cooling core to underneath the mantle is an order of magnitude more
efficient per unit mass as a source of buoyancy than inner-core growth. We
therefore conclude that Earth's dynamo would survive throughout geologic time
(from at least 3.4 billion years ago to the present) even if core radiogenic
heating were minimal and core cooling were slow.

Future ocean hypercapnia driven by anthropogenic amplification of the natural CO2
cycle.

High carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in sea-water (ocean hypercapnia) can
induce neurological, physiological and behavioural deficiencies in marine
animals. Prediction of the onset and evolution of hypercapnia in the ocean
requires a good understanding of annual variations in oceanic CO2 concentration, 
but there is a lack of relevant global observational data. Here we identify
global ocean patterns of monthly variability in carbon concentration using
observations that allow us to examine the evolution of surface-ocean CO2 levels
over the entire annual cycle under increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We 
predict that the present-day amplitude of the natural oscillations in oceanic CO2
concentration will be amplified by up to tenfold in some regions by 2100, if
atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise throughout this century
(according to the RCP8.5 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change). The findings from our data are broadly consistent with projections from 
Earth system climate models. Our predicted amplification of the annual CO2 cycle 
displays distinct global patterns that may expose major fisheries in the
Southern, Pacific and North Atlantic oceans to hypercapnia many decades earlier
than is expected from average atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We suggest that
these ocean 'CO2 hotspots' evolve as a combination of the strong seasonal
dynamics of CO2 concentration and the long-term effective storage of
anthropogenic CO2 in the oceans that lowers the buffer capacity in these regions,
causing a nonlinear amplification of CO2 concentration over the annual cycle. The
onset of ocean hypercapnia (when the partial pressure of CO2 in sea-water exceeds
1,000 micro-atmospheres) is forecast for atmospheric CO2 concentrations that
exceed 650 parts per million, with hypercapnia expected in up to half the surface
ocean by 2100, assuming a high-emissions scenario (RCP8.5). Such extensive ocean 
hypercapnia has detrimental implications for fisheries during the twenty-first
century.

Antimatter continues to intrigue physicists because of its apparent absence in
the observable Universe. Current theory requires that matter and antimatter
appeared in equal quantities after the Big Bang, but the Standard Model of
particle physics offers no quantitative explanation for the apparent
disappearance of half the Universe. It has recently become possible to study
trapped atoms of antihydrogen to search for possible, as yet unobserved,
differences in the physical behaviour of matter and antimatter. Here we consider 
the charge neutrality of the antihydrogen atom. By applying stochastic
acceleration to trapped antihydrogen atoms, we determine an experimental bound on
the antihydrogen charge, Qe, of |Q| < 0.71 parts per billion (one standard
deviation), in which e is the elementary charge. This bound is a factor of 20
less than that determined from the best previous measurement of the antihydrogen 
charge. The electrical charge of atoms and molecules of normal matter is known to
be no greater than about 10(-21)e for a diverse range of species including H2, He
and SF6. Charge-parity-time symmetry and quantum anomaly cancellation demand that
the charge of antihydrogen be similarly small. Thus, our measurement constitutes 
an improved limit and a test of fundamental aspects of the Standard Model. If we 
assume charge superposition and use the best measured value of the antiproton
charge, then we can place a new limit on the positron charge anomaly (the
relative difference between the positron and elementary charge) of about one part
per billion (one standard deviation), a 25-fold reduction compared to the current
best measurement.

The looming antibiotic-resistance crisis has penetrated the consciousness of
clinicians, researchers, policymakers, politicians and the public at large. The
evolution and widespread distribution of antibiotic-resistance elements in
bacterial pathogens has made diseases that were once easily treatable deadly
again. Unfortunately, accompanying the rise in global resistance is a failure in 
antibacterial drug discovery. Lessons from the history of antibiotic discovery
and fresh understanding of antibiotic action and the cell biology of
microorganisms have the potential to deliver twenty-first century medicines that 
are able to control infection in the resistance era.

Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum as a conduit to human disease.

Wang M(1), Kaufman RJ(1).

Author information:

Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.

In eukaryotic cells, the endoplasmic reticulum is essential for the folding and
trafficking of proteins that enter the secretory pathway. Environmental insults
or increased protein synthesis often lead to protein misfolding in the organelle,
the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins - known as endoplasmic
reticulum stress - and the activation of the adaptive unfolded protein response
to restore homeostasis. If protein misfolding is not resolved, cells die.
Endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unfolded protein response help
to determine cell fate and function. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum stress
contributes to the aetiology of many human diseases.

Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, 1300 York Avenue, New York, New York

Endothelial cells that line capillaries are not just passive conduits for
delivering blood. Tissue-specific endothelium establishes specialized vascular
niches that deploy sets of growth factors, known as angiocrine factors. These
cues participate actively in the induction, specification, patterning and
guidance of organ regeneration, as well as in the maintainance of homeostasis and
metabolism. When upregulated following injury, they orchestrate self-renewal and 
differentiation of tissue-specific resident stem and progenitor cells into
functional organs. Uncovering the mechanisms by which organotypic endothelium
distributes physiological levels of angiocrine factors both spatially and
temporally will lay the foundation for clinical trials that promote organ repair 
without scarring.

Inflammation underlies many chronic and degenerative diseases, but it also
mitigates infections, clears damaged cells and initiates tissue repair. Many of
the mechanisms that link inflammation to damage repair and regeneration in
mammals are conserved in lower organisms, indicating that it is an evolutionarily
important process. Recent insights have shed light on the cellular and molecular 
processes through which conventional inflammatory cytokines and Wnt factors
control mammalian tissue repair and regeneration. This is particularly important 
for regeneration in the gastrointestinal system, especially for intestine and
liver tissues in which aberrant and deregulated repair results in severe
pathologies.

Metastasis is the main cause of death in people with cancer. To colonize distant 
organs, circulating tumour cells must overcome many obstacles through mechanisms 
that we are only now starting to understand. These include infiltrating distant
tissue, evading immune defences, adapting to supportive niches, surviving as
latent tumour-initiating seeds and eventually breaking out to replace the host
tissue. They make metastasis a highly inefficient process. However, once
metastases have been established, current treatments frequently fail to provide
durable responses. An improved understanding of the mechanistic determinants of
such colonization is needed to better prevent and treat metastatic cancer.

The development of targeted anti-cancer therapies through the study of cancer
genomes is intended to increase survival rates and decrease treatment-related
toxicity. We treated a transposon-driven, functional genomic mouse model of
medulloblastoma with 'humanized' in vivo therapy (microneurosurgical tumour
resection followed by multi-fractionated, image-guided radiotherapy). Genetic
events in recurrent murine medulloblastoma exhibit a very poor overlap with those
in matched murine diagnostic samples (<5%). Whole-genome sequencing of 33 pairs
of human diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastomas demonstrated substantial
genetic divergence of the dominant clone after therapy (<12% diagnostic events
were retained at recurrence). In both mice and humans, the dominant clone at
recurrence arose through clonal selection of a pre-existing minor clone present
at diagnosis. Targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective in the absence of the 
target, therefore our results offer a simple, proximal, and remediable
explanation for the failure of prior clinical trials of targeted therapy.

Although water vapour is the main species observed in the coma of comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and water is the major constituent of cometary nuclei, 
limited evidence for exposed water-ice regions on the surface of the nucleus has 
been found so far. The absence of large regions of exposed water ice seems a
common finding on the surfaces of many of the comets observed so far. The nucleus
of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko appears to be fairly uniformly coated with dark,
dehydrated, refractory and organic-rich material. Here we report the
identification at infrared wavelengths of water ice on two debris falls in the
Imhotep region of the nucleus. The ice has been exposed on the walls of elevated 
structures and at the base of the walls. A quantitative derivation of the
abundance of ice in these regions indicates the presence of millimetre-sized pure
water-ice grains, considerably larger than in all previous observations. Although
micrometre-sized water-ice grains are the usual result of vapour recondensation
in ice-free layers, the occurrence of millimetre-sized grains of pure ice as
observed in the Imhotep debris falls is best explained by grain growth by vapour 
diffusion in ice-rich layers, or by sintering. As a consequence of these
processes, the nucleus can develop an extended and complex coating in which the
outer dehydrated crust is superimposed on layers enriched in water ice. The
stratigraphy observed on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is therefore the result of
evolutionary processes affecting the uppermost metres of the nucleus and does not
necessarily require a global layering to have occurred at the time of the comet's
formation.

Motor neurons are the final stage of neural processing for the execution of motor
behaviours. Traditionally, motor neurons have been viewed as the 'final common
pathway', serving as passive recipients merely conveying to the muscles the final
motor program generated by upstream interneuron circuits. Here we reveal an
unforeseen role of motor neurons in controlling the locomotor circuit function
via gap junctions in zebrafish. These gap junctions mediate a retrograde analogue
propagation of voltage fluctuations from motor neurons to control the synaptic
release and recruitment of the upstream V2a interneurons that drive locomotion.
Selective inhibition of motor neurons during ongoing locomotion de-recruits V2a
interneurons and strongly influences locomotor circuit function. Rather than
acting as separate units, gap junctions unite motor neurons and V2a interneurons 
into functional ensembles endowed with a retrograde analogue computation
essential for locomotor rhythm generation. These results show that motor neurons 
are not a passive recipient of motor commands but an integral component of the
neural circuits responsible for motor behaviour.

Degeneracy in the genetic code, which enables a single protein to be encoded by a
multitude of synonymous gene sequences, has an important role in regulating
protein expression, but substantial uncertainty exists concerning the details of 
this phenomenon. Here we analyse the sequence features influencing protein
expression levels in 6,348 experiments using bacteriophage T7 polymerase to
synthesize messenger RNA in Escherichia coli. Logistic regression yields a new
codon-influence metric that correlates only weakly with genomic codon-usage
frequency, but strongly with global physiological protein concentrations and also
mRNA concentrations and lifetimes in vivo. Overall, the codon content influences 
protein expression more strongly than mRNA-folding parameters, although the
latter dominate in the initial ~16 codons. Genes redesigned based on our analyses
are transcribed with unaltered efficiency but translated with higher efficiency
in vitro. The less efficiently translated native sequences show greatly reduced
mRNA levels in vivo. Our results suggest that codon content modulates a kinetic
competition between protein elongation and mRNA degradation that is a central
feature of the physiology and also possibly the regulation of translation in E.
coli.

How ecosystem productivity and species richness are interrelated is one of the
most debated subjects in the history of ecology. Decades of intensive study have 
yet to discern the actual mechanisms behind observed global patterns. Here, by
integrating the predictions from multiple theories into a single model and using 
data from 1,126 grassland plots spanning five continents, we detect the clear
signals of numerous underlying mechanisms linking productivity and richness. We
find that an integrative model has substantially higher explanatory power than
traditional bivariate analyses. In addition, the specific results unveil several 
surprising findings that conflict with classical models. These include the
isolation of a strong and consistent enhancement of productivity by richness, an 
effect in striking contrast with superficial data patterns. Also revealed is a
consistent importance of competition across the full range of productivity
values, in direct conflict with some (but not all) proposed models. The promotion
of local richness by macroecological gradients in climatic favourability,
generally seen as a competing hypothesis, is also found to be important in our
analysis. The results demonstrate that an integrative modelling approach leads to
a major advance in our ability to discern the underlying processes operating in
ecological systems.

Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of
DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into
distinct territories. At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which 
encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the
three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene
regulatory mechanisms, but understanding this organization remains a challenge.
At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic
states that are essential for regulating gene expression. Here we investigate the
3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using
super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into 
transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed
distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin
domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their
domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed
domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour,
in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from
the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive 
chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of
chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, 
Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a
much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest
that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play
an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed
chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin 
packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a
length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation.

Phosphoinositides are a minor class of short-lived membrane phospholipids that
serve crucial functions in cell physiology ranging from cell signalling and
motility to their role as signposts of compartmental membrane identity.
Phosphoinositide 4-phosphates such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P)
and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) are concentrated at the
plasma membrane, on secretory organelles, and on lysosomes, whereas
phosphoinositide 3-phosphates, most notably phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
(PI(3)P), are a hallmark of the endosomal system. Directional membrane traffic
between endosomal and secretory compartments, although inherently complex,
therefore requires regulated phosphoinositide conversion. The molecular mechanism
underlying this conversion of phosphoinositide identity during cargo exit from
endosomes by exocytosis is unknown. Here we report that surface delivery of
endosomal cargo requires hydrolysis of PI(3)P by the phosphatidylinositol
3-phosphatase MTM1, an enzyme whose loss of function leads to X-linked
centronuclear myopathy (also called myotubular myopathy) in humans. Removal of
endosomal PI(3)P by MTM1 is accompanied by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-2α
(PI4K2α)-dependent generation of PI(4)P and recruitment of the exocyst tethering 
complex to enable membrane fusion. Our data establish a mechanism for
phosphoinositide conversion from PI(3)P to PI(4)P at endosomes en route to the
plasma membrane and suggest that defective phosphoinositide conversion at
endosomes underlies X-linked centronuclear myopathy caused by mutation of MTM1 in
humans.

Batteries based on sodium superoxide and on potassium superoxide have recently
been reported. However, there have been no reports of a battery based on lithium 
superoxide (LiO2), despite much research into the lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery 
because of its potential high energy density. Several studies of Li-O2 batteries 
have found evidence of LiO2 being formed as one component of the discharge
product along with lithium peroxide (Li2O2). In addition, theoretical
calculations have indicated that some forms of LiO2 may have a long lifetime.
These studies also suggest that it might be possible to form LiO2 alone for use
in a battery. However, solid LiO2 has been difficult to synthesize in pure form
because it is thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation,
giving Li2O2 (refs 19, 20). Here we show that crystalline LiO2 can be stabilized 
in a Li-O2 battery by using a suitable graphene-based cathode. Various
characterization techniques reveal no evidence for the presence of Li2O2. A novel
templating growth mechanism involving the use of iridium nanoparticles on the
cathode surface may be responsible for the growth of crystalline LiO2. Our
results demonstrate that the LiO2 formed in the Li-O2 battery is stable enough
for the battery to be repeatedly charged and discharged with a very low charge
potential (about 3.2 volts). We anticipate that this discovery will lead to
methods of synthesizing and stabilizing LiO2, which could open the way to
high-energy-density batteries based on LiO2 as well as to other possible uses of 
this compound, such as oxygen storage.

Nanog, a core pluripotency factor in the inner cell mass of blastocysts, is also 
expressed in unipotent primordial germ cells (PGCs) in mice, where its precise
role is yet unclear. We investigated this in an in vitro model, in which naive
pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured in basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF) and activin A develop as epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and gain competence 
for a PGC-like fate. Consequently, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), or
ectopic expression of key germline transcription factors Prdm1, Prdm14 and
Tfap2c, directly induce PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) in EpiLCs, but not in ES cells.
Here we report an unexpected discovery that Nanog alone can induce PGCLCs in
EpiLCs, independently of BMP4. We propose that after the dissolution of the naive
ES-cell pluripotency network during establishment of EpiLCs, the epigenome is
reset for cell fate determination. Indeed, we found genome-wide changes in
NANOG-binding patterns between ES cells and EpiLCs, indicating epigenetic
resetting of regulatory elements. Accordingly, we show that NANOG can bind and
activate enhancers of Prdm1 and Prdm14 in EpiLCs in vitro; BLIMP1 (encoded by
Prdm1) then directly induces Tfap2c. Furthermore, while SOX2 and NANOG promote
the pluripotent state in ES cells, they show contrasting roles in EpiLCs, as Sox2
specifically represses PGCLC induction by Nanog. This study demonstrates a
broadly applicable mechanistic principle for how cells acquire competence for
cell fate determination, resulting in the context-dependent roles of key
transcription factors during development.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous and clinically aggressive
disease for which there is no targeted therapy. BET bromodomain inhibitors, which
have shown efficacy in several models of cancer, have not been evaluated in TNBC.
These inhibitors displace BET bromodomain proteins such as BRD4 from chromatin by
competing with their acetyl-lysine recognition modules, leading to inhibition of 
oncogenic transcriptional programs. Here we report the preferential sensitivity
of TNBCs to BET bromodomain inhibition in vitro and in vivo, establishing a
rationale for clinical investigation and further motivation to understand
mechanisms of resistance. In paired cell lines selected for acquired resistance
to BET inhibition from previously sensitive TNBCs, we failed to identify
gatekeeper mutations, new driver events or drug pump activation. BET-resistant
TNBC cells remain dependent on wild-type BRD4, which supports transcription and
cell proliferation in a bromodomain-independent manner. Proteomic studies of
resistant TNBC identify strong association with MED1 and hyper-phosphorylation of
BRD4 attributable to decreased activity of PP2A, identified here as a principal
BRD4 serine phosphatase. Together, these studies provide a rationale for BET
inhibition in TNBC and present mechanism-based combination strategies to
anticipate clinical drug resistance.

In the vertebrate visual system, all output of the retina is carried by retinal
ganglion cells. Each type encodes distinct visual features in parallel for
transmission to the brain. How many such 'output channels' exist and what each
encodes are areas of intense debate. In the mouse, anatomical estimates range
from 15 to 20 channels, and only a handful are functionally understood. By
combining two-photon calcium imaging to obtain dense retinal recordings and
unsupervised clustering of the resulting sample of more than 11,000 cells, here
we show that the mouse retina harbours substantially more than 30 functional
output channels. These include all known and several new ganglion cell types, as 
verified by genetic and anatomical criteria. Therefore, information channels from
the mouse eye to the mouse brain are considerably more diverse than shown thus
far by anatomical studies, suggesting an encoding strategy resembling that used
in state-of-the-art artificial vision systems.

Magnetic fields play a part in almost all stages of stellar evolution. Most
low-mass stars, including the Sun, show surface fields that are generated by
dynamo processes in their convective envelopes. Intermediate-mass stars do not
have deep convective envelopes, although 10 per cent exhibit strong surface
fields that are presumed to be residuals from the star formation process. These
stars do have convective cores that might produce internal magnetic fields, and
these fields might survive into later stages of stellar evolution, but
information has been limited by our inability to measure the fields below the
stellar surface. Here we report the strength of dipolar oscillation modes for a
sample of 3,600 red giant stars. About 20 per cent of our sample show mode
suppression, by strong magnetic fields in the cores, but this fraction is a
strong function of mass. Strong core fields occur only in red giants heavier than
1.1 solar masses, and the occurrence rate is at least 50 per cent for
intermediate-mass stars (1.6-2.0 solar masses), indicating that powerful dynamos 
were very common in the previously convective cores of these stars.

Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are very large proteins that produce
small peptide molecules with wide-ranging biological activities, including
environmentally friendly chemicals and many widely used therapeutics. NRPSs are
macromolecular machines, with modular assembly-line logic, a complex catalytic
cycle, moving parts and many active sites. In addition to the core domains
required to link the substrates, they often include specialized tailoring
domains, which introduce chemical modifications and allow the product to access a
large expanse of chemical space. It is still unknown how the NRPS tailoring
domains are structurally accommodated into megaenzymes or how they have adapted
to function in nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Here we present a series of
crystal structures of the initiation module of an antibiotic-producing NRPS,
linear gramicidin synthetase. This module includes the specialized tailoring
formylation domain, and states are captured that represent every major step of
the assembly-line synthesis in the initiation module. The transitions between
conformations are large in scale, with both the peptidyl carrier protein domain
and the adenylation subdomain undergoing huge movements to transport substrate
between distal active sites. The structures highlight the great versatility of
NRPSs, as small domains repurpose and recycle their limited interfaces to
interact with their various binding partners. Understanding tailoring domains is 
important if NRPSs are to be utilized in the production of novel therapeutics.

Many important natural products are produced by multidomain non-ribosomal peptide
synthetases (NRPSs). During synthesis, intermediates are covalently bound to
integrated carrier domains and transported to neighbouring catalytic domains in
an assembly line fashion. Understanding the structural basis for catalysis with
non-ribosomal peptide synthetases will facilitate bioengineering to create novel 
products. Here we describe the structures of two different holo-non-ribosomal
peptide synthetase modules, each revealing a distinct step in the catalytic
cycle. One structure depicts the carrier domain cofactor bound to the peptide
bond-forming condensation domain, whereas a second structure captures the
installation of the amino acid onto the cofactor within the adenylation domain.
These structures demonstrate that a conformational change within the adenylation 
domain guides transfer of intermediates between domains. Furthermore, one
structure shows that the condensation and adenylation domains simultaneously
adopt their catalytic conformations, increasing the overall efficiency in a
revised structural cycle. These structures and the single-particle electron
microscopy analysis demonstrate a highly dynamic domain architecture and provide 
the foundation for understanding the structural mechanisms that could enable
engineering of novel non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.

    Trends Parasitol. 2016 Aug;32(8):583-5.

Helminth parasitic infections are a major global health and social burden. The
host defence against helminths such as Nippostrongylus brasiliensis is
orchestrated by type 2 cell-mediated immunity. Induction of type 2 cytokines,
including interleukins (IL) IL-4 and IL-13, induce goblet cell hyperplasia with
mucus production, ultimately resulting in worm expulsion. However, the mechanisms
underlying the initiation of type 2 responses remain incompletely understood.
Here we show that tuft cells, a rare epithelial cell type in the steady-state
intestinal epithelium, are responsible for initiating type 2 responses to
parasites by a cytokine-mediated cellular relay. Tuft cells have a Th2-related
gene expression signature and we demonstrate that they undergo a rapid and
extensive IL-4Rα-dependent amplification following infection with helminth
parasites, owing to direct differentiation of epithelial crypt progenitor cells. 
We find that the Pou2f3 gene is essential for tuft cell specification.
Pou2f3(-/-) mice lack intestinal tuft cells and have defective mucosal type 2
responses to helminth infection; goblet cell hyperplasia is abrogated and worm
expulsion is compromised. Notably, IL-4Rα signalling is sufficient to induce
expansion of the tuft cell lineage, and ectopic stimulation of this signalling
cascade obviates the need for tuft cells in the epithelial cell remodelling of
the intestine. Moreover, tuft cells secrete IL-25, thereby regulating type 2
immune responses. Our data reveal a novel function of intestinal epithelial tuft 
cells and demonstrate a cellular relay required for initiating mucosal type 2
immunity to helminth infection.

The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in
many aspects of human biology, including immune function and metabolism. The
reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in Western populations compared to that
in populations living traditional lifestyles presents the question of which
factors have driven microbiota change during modernization. Microbiota-accessible
carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fibre have a crucial involvement in shaping
this microbial ecosystem, and are notably reduced in the Western diet (high in
fat and simple carbohydrates, low in fibre) compared with a more traditional
diet. Here we show that changes in the microbiota of mice consuming a low-MAC
diet and harbouring a human microbiota are largely reversible within a single
generation. However, over several generations, a low-MAC diet results in a
progressive loss of diversity, which is not recoverable after the reintroduction 
of dietary MACs. To restore the microbiota to its original state requires the
administration of missing taxa in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Our
data illustrate that taxa driven to low abundance when dietary MACs are scarce
are inefficiently transferred to the next generation, and are at increased risk
of becoming extinct within an isolated population. As more diseases are linked to
the Western microbiota and the microbiota is targeted therapeutically, microbiota
reprogramming may need to involve strategies that incorporate dietary MACs as
well as taxa not currently present in the Western gut.

Sulawesi is the largest and oldest island within Wallacea, a vast zone of oceanic
islands separating continental Asia from the Pleistocene landmass of Australia
and Papua (Sahul). By one million years ago an unknown hominin lineage had
colonized Flores immediately to the south, and by about 50 thousand years ago,
modern humans (Homo sapiens) had crossed to Sahul. On the basis of position,
oceanic currents and biogeographical context, Sulawesi probably played a pivotal 
part in these dispersals. Uranium-series dating of speleothem deposits associated
with rock art in the limestone karst region of Maros in southwest Sulawesi has
revealed that humans were living on the island at least 40 thousand years ago
(ref. 5). Here we report new excavations at Talepu in the Walanae Basin northeast
of Maros, where in situ stone artefacts associated with fossil remains of
megafauna (Bubalus sp., Stegodon and Celebochoerus) have been recovered from
stratified deposits that accumulated from before 200 thousand years ago until
about 100 thousand years ago. Our findings suggest that Sulawesi, like Flores,
was host to a long-established population of archaic hominins, the ancestral
origins and taxonomic status of which remain elusive.

The past rapid growth of Northern Hemisphere continental ice sheets, which
terminated warm and stable climate periods, is generally attributed to reduced
summer insolation in boreal latitudes. Yet such summer insolation is near to its 
minimum at present, and there are no signs of a new ice age. This challenges our 
understanding of the mechanisms driving glacial cycles and our ability to predict
the next glacial inception. Here we propose a critical functional relationship
between boreal summer insolation and global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration,
which explains the beginning of the past eight glacial cycles and might
anticipate future periods of glacial inception. Using an ensemble of simulations 
generated by an Earth system model of intermediate complexity constrained by
palaeoclimatic data, we suggest that glacial inception was narrowly missed before
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The missed inception can be accounted
for by the combined effect of relatively high late-Holocene CO2 concentrations
and the low orbital eccentricity of the Earth. Additionally, our analysis
suggests that even in the absence of human perturbations no substantial build-up 
of ice sheets would occur within the next several thousand years and that the
current interglacial would probably last for another 50,000 years. However,
moderate anthropogenic cumulative CO2 emissions of 1,000 to 1,500 gigatonnes of
carbon will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years. Our
simulations demonstrate that under natural conditions alone the Earth system
would be expected to remain in the present delicately balanced interglacial
climate state, steering clear of both large-scale glaciation of the Northern
Hemisphere and its complete deglaciation, for an unusually long time.

A thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of
a drug in animal models is a critical component of drug discovery and
development. Such studies are performed in vivo and in vitro at various stages of
the development process--ranging from preclinical absorption, distribution,
metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies to late-stage human clinical trials--to
elucidate a drug molecule's metabolic profile and to assess its toxicity.
Radiolabelled compounds, typically those that contain (14)C or (3)H isotopes, are
one of the most powerful and widely deployed diagnostics for these studies. The
introduction of radiolabels using synthetic chemistry enables the direct tracing 
of the drug molecule without substantially altering its structure or function.
The ubiquity of C-H bonds in drugs and the relative ease and low cost associated 
with tritium ((3)H) make it an ideal radioisotope with which to conduct ADME
studies early in the drug development process. Here we describe an iron-catalysed
method for the direct (3)H labelling of pharmaceuticals by hydrogen isotope
exchange, using tritium gas as the source of the radioisotope. The site
selectivity of the iron catalyst is orthogonal to currently used iridium
catalysts and allows isotopic labelling of complementary positions in drug
molecules, providing a new diagnostic tool in drug development.

One of the key questions in observational cosmology is the identification of the 
sources responsible for ionization of the Universe after the cosmic 'Dark Ages', 
when the baryonic matter was neutral. The currently identified distant galaxies
are insufficient to fully reionize the Universe by redshift z ≈ 6 (refs 1-3), but
low-mass, star-forming galaxies are thought to be responsible for the bulk of the
ionizing radiation. As direct observations at high redshift are difficult for a
variety of reasons, one solution is to identify local proxies of this galaxy
population. Starburst galaxies at low redshifts, however, generally are opaque to
Lyman continuum photons. Small escape fractions of about 1 to 3 per cent,
insufficient to ionize much surrounding gas, have been detected only in three
low-redshift galaxies. Here we report far-ultraviolet observations of the nearby 
low-mass star-forming galaxy J0925+1403. The galaxy is leaking ionizing radiation
with an escape fraction of about 8 per cent. The total number of photons emitted 
during the starburst phase is sufficient to ionize intergalactic medium material 
that is about 40 times as massive as the stellar mass of the galaxy.

Mechanisms that maintain cancer stem cells are crucial to tumour progression. The
ID2 protein supports cancer hallmarks including the cancer stem cell state. HIFα 
transcription factors, most notably HIF2α (also known as EPAS1), are expressed in
and required for maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the pathways
that are engaged by ID2 or drive HIF2α accumulation in CSCs have remained
unclear. Here we report that DYRK1A and DYRK1B kinases phosphorylate ID2 on
threonine 27 (Thr27). Hypoxia downregulates this phosphorylation via inactivation
of DYRK1A and DYRK1B. The activity of these kinases is stimulated in normoxia by 
the oxygen-sensing prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 (also known as EGLN2). ID2 binds to
the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex, displaces VHL-associated Cullin 2, and impairs 
HIF2α ubiquitylation and degradation. Phosphorylation of Thr27 of ID2 by DYRK1
blocks ID2-VHL interaction and preserves HIF2α ubiquitylation. In glioblastoma,
ID2 positively modulates HIF2α activity. Conversely, elevated expression of DYRK1
phosphorylates Thr27 of ID2, leading to HIF2α destabilization, loss of glioma
stemness, inhibition of tumour growth, and a more favourable outcome for patients
with glioblastoma.

Endothelial cells (ECs) are plastic cells that can switch between growth states
with different bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements. Although quiescent in 
most healthy tissues, ECs divide and migrate rapidly upon proangiogenic
stimulation. Adjusting endothelial metabolism to the growth state is central to
normal vessel growth and function, yet it is poorly understood at the molecular
level. Here we report that the forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor FOXO1
is an essential regulator of vascular growth that couples metabolic and
proliferative activities in ECs. Endothelial-restricted deletion of FOXO1 in mice
induces a profound increase in EC proliferation that interferes with coordinated 
sprouting, thereby causing hyperplasia and vessel enlargement. Conversely, forced
expression of FOXO1 restricts vascular expansion and leads to vessel thinning and
hypobranching. We find that FOXO1 acts as a gatekeeper of endothelial quiescence,
which decelerates metabolic activity by reducing glycolysis and mitochondrial
respiration. Mechanistically, FOXO1 suppresses signalling by MYC (also known as
c-MYC), a powerful driver of anabolic metabolism and growth. MYC ablation impairs
glycolysis, mitochondrial function and proliferation of ECs while its EC-specific
overexpression fuels these processes. Moreover, restoration of MYC signalling in 
FOXO1-overexpressing endothelium normalizes metabolic activity and branching
behaviour. Our findings identify FOXO1 as a critical rheostat of vascular
expansion and define the FOXO1-MYC transcriptional network as a novel metabolic
checkpoint during endothelial growth and proliferation.

Catalysis in biology is restricted to RNA (ribozymes) and protein enzymes, but
synthetic biomolecular catalysts can also be made of DNA (deoxyribozymes) or
synthetic genetic polymers. In vitro selection from synthetic random DNA
libraries identified DNA catalysts for various chemical reactions beyond RNA
backbone cleavage. DNA-catalysed reactions include RNA and DNA ligation in
various topologies, hydrolytic cleavage and photorepair of DNA, as well as
reactions of peptides and small molecules. In spite of comprehensive biochemical 
studies of DNA catalysts for two decades, fundamental mechanistic understanding
of their function is lacking in the absence of three-dimensional models at atomic
resolution. Early attempts to solve the crystal structure of an RNA-cleaving
deoxyribozyme resulted in a catalytically irrelevant nucleic acid fold. Here we
report the crystal structure of the RNA-ligating deoxyribozyme 9DB1 (ref. 14) at 
2.8 Å resolution. The structure captures the ligation reaction in the
post-catalytic state, revealing a compact folding unit stabilized by numerous
tertiary interactions, and an unanticipated organization of the catalytic centre.
Structure-guided mutagenesis provided insights into the basis for
regioselectivity of the ligation reaction and allowed remarkable manipulation of 
substrate recognition and reaction rate. Moreover, the structure highlights how
the specific properties of deoxyribose are reflected in the backbone conformation
of the DNA catalyst, in support of its intricate three-dimensional organization. 
The structural principles underlying the catalytic ability of DNA elucidate
differences and similarities in DNA versus RNA catalysts, which is relevant for
comprehending the privileged position of folded RNA in the prebiotic world and in
current organisms.

A knowledge of stellar ages is crucial for our understanding of many
astrophysical phenomena, and yet ages can be difficult to determine. As they
become older, stars lose mass and angular momentum, resulting in an observed
slowdown in surface rotation. The technique of 'gyrochronology' uses the rotation
period of a star to calculate its age. However, stars of known age must be used
for calibration, and, until recently, the approach was untested for old stars
(older than 1 gigayear, Gyr). Rotation periods are now known for stars in an open
cluster of intermediate age (NGC 6819; 2.5 Gyr old), and for old field stars
whose ages have been determined with asteroseismology. The data for the cluster
agree with previous period-age relations, but these relations fail to describe
the asteroseismic sample. Here we report stellar evolutionary modelling, and
confirm the presence of unexpectedly rapid rotation in stars that are more
evolved than the Sun. We demonstrate that models that incorporate dramatically
weakened magnetic braking for old stars can--unlike existing models--reproduce
both the asteroseismic and the cluster data. Our findings might suggest a
fundamental change in the nature of ageing stellar dynamos, with the Sun being
close to the critical transition to much weaker magnetized winds. This weakened
braking limits the diagnostic power of gyrochronology for those stars that are
more than halfway through their main-sequence lifetimes.

Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet
comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable 
in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major
traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of
vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional 
trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs.
Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global
spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane
reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf 
economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth
potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating
constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and
for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation
in plant form and function.

To understand the complex physics of a system with strong electron-electron
interactions, the ideal is to control and monitor its properties while tuning an 
external electric field applied to the system (the electric-field effect).
Indeed, complete electric-field control of many-body states in strongly
correlated electron systems is fundamental to the next generation of condensed
matter research and devices. However, the material must be thin enough to avoid
shielding of the electric field in the bulk material. Two-dimensional materials
do not experience electrical screening, and their charge-carrier density can be
controlled by gating. Octahedral titanium diselenide (1T-TiSe2) is a prototypical
two-dimensional material that reveals a charge-density wave (CDW) and
superconductivity in its phase diagram, presenting several similarities with
other layered systems such as copper oxides, iron pnictides, and crystals of
rare-earth elements and actinide atoms. By studying 1T-TiSe2 single crystals with
thicknesses of 10 nanometres or less, encapsulated in two-dimensional layers of
hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition
temperature (tuned from 170 kelvin to 40 kelvin), and over the superconductivity 
transition temperature (tuned from a quantum critical point at 0 kelvin up to
3 kelvin). Electrically driving TiSe2 over different ordered electronic phases
allows us to study the details of the phase transitions between many-body states.
Observations of periodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the
Little-Parks effect show that the appearance of superconductivity is directly
correlated with the spatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the
superconductivity order parameter, corresponding to a two-dimensional matrix of
superconductivity. We infer that this superconductivity matrix is supported by a 
matrix of incommensurate CDW states embedded in the commensurate CDW states. Our 
results show that spatially modulated electronic states are fundamental to the
appearance of two-dimensional superconductivity.

Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have
globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions, but how 
these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community
assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear. Here we use growth data
from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how
three key functional traits--wood density, specific leaf area and maximum
height--consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a
species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and
positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also 
correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive
effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low
competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with
competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in
the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via
differentiation in their successional strategies. Competition within species was 
stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between
species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of
dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a
weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait-based approach to modelling
competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the
world and their highly diverse species composition.

polymer.

The global occurrence in water resources of organic micropollutants, such as
pesticides and pharmaceuticals, has raised concerns about potential negative
effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. Activated carbons are the most
widespread adsorbent materials used to remove organic pollutants from water but
they have several deficiencies, including slow pollutant uptake (of the order of 
hours) and poor removal of many relatively hydrophilic micropollutants.
Furthermore, regenerating spent activated carbon is energy intensive (requiring
heating to 500-900 degrees Celsius) and does not fully restore performance.
Insoluble polymers of β-cyclodextrin, an inexpensive, sustainably produced
macrocycle of glucose, are likewise of interest for removing micropollutants from
water by means of adsorption. β-cyclodextrin is known to encapsulate pollutants
to form well-defined host-guest complexes, but until now cross-linked
β-cyclodextrin polymers have had low surface areas and poor removal performance
compared to conventional activated carbons. Here we crosslink β-cyclodextrin with
rigid aromatic groups, providing a high-surface-area, mesoporous polymer of
β-cyclodextrin. It rapidly sequesters a variety of organic micropollutants with
adsorption rate constants 15 to 200 times greater than those of activated carbons
and non-porous β-cyclodextrin adsorbent materials. In addition, the polymer can
be regenerated several times using a mild washing procedure with no loss in
performance. Finally, the polymer outperformed a leading activated carbon for the
rapid removal of a complex mixture of organic micropollutants at environmentally 
relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate the promise of porous
cyclodextrin-based polymers for rapid, flow-through water treatment.

Parasitic helminths and allergens induce a type 2 immune response leading to
profound changes in tissue physiology, including hyperplasia of mucus-secreting
goblet cells and smooth muscle hypercontractility. This response, known as 'weep 
and sweep', requires interleukin (IL)-13 production by tissue-resident group 2
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and recruited type 2 helper T cells (TH2 cells).
Experiments in mice and humans have demonstrated requirements for the epithelial 
cytokines IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-25 in the activation 
of ILC2s, but the sources and regulation of these signals remain poorly defined. 
In the small intestine, the epithelium consists of at least five distinct
cellular lineages, including the tuft cell, whose function is unclear. Here we
show that tuft cells constitutively express IL-25 to sustain ILC2 homeostasis in 
the resting lamina propria in mice. After helminth infection, tuft-cell-derived
IL-25 further activates ILC2s to secrete IL-13, which acts on epithelial crypt
progenitors to promote differentiation of tuft and goblet cells, leading to
increased frequencies of both. Tuft cells, ILC2s and epithelial progenitors
therefore comprise a response circuit that mediates epithelial remodelling
associated with type 2 immunity in the small intestine, and perhaps at other
mucosal barriers populated by these cells.

Influenza pandemics occur unpredictably when zoonotic influenza viruses with
novel antigenicity acquire the ability to transmit amongst humans. Host range
breaches are limited by incompatibilities between avian virus components and the 
human host. Barriers include receptor preference, virion stability and poor
activity of the avian virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in human cells. Mutants 
of the heterotrimeric viral polymerase components, particularly PB2 protein, are 
selected during mammalian adaptation, but their mode of action is unknown. We
show that a species-specific difference in host protein ANP32A accounts for the
suboptimal function of avian virus polymerase in mammalian cells. Avian ANP32A
possesses an additional 33 amino acids between the leucine-rich repeats and
carboxy-terminal low-complexity acidic region domains. In mammalian cells, avian 
ANP32A rescued the suboptimal function of avian virus polymerase to levels
similar to mammalian-adapted polymerase. Deletion of the avian-specific sequence 
from chicken ANP32A abrogated this activity, whereas its insertion into human
ANP32A, or closely related ANP32B, supported avian virus polymerase function.
Substitutions, such as PB2(E627K), were rapidly selected upon infection of humans
with avian H5N1 or H7N9 influenza viruses, adapting the viral polymerase for the 
shorter mammalian ANP32A. Thus ANP32A represents an essential host partner
co-opted to support influenza virus replication and is a candidate host target
for novel antivirals.

It has been known for more than 70 years that synaptic strength is dynamically
regulated in a use-dependent manner. At synapses with a low initial release
probability, closely spaced presynaptic action potentials can result in
facilitation, a short-term form of enhancement in which each subsequent action
potential evokes greater neurotransmitter release. Facilitation can enhance
neurotransmitter release considerably and can profoundly influence information
transfer across synapses, but the underlying mechanism remains a mystery. One
proposed mechanism is that a specialized calcium sensor for facilitation
transiently increases the probability of release, and this sensor is distinct
from the fast sensors that mediate rapid neurotransmitter release. Yet such a
sensor has never been identified, and its very existence has been disputed. Here 
we show that synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) is a calcium sensor that is required for
facilitation at several central synapses. In Syt7-knockout mice, facilitation is 
eliminated even though the initial probability of release and the presynaptic
residual calcium signals are unaltered. Expression of wild-type Syt7 in
presynaptic neurons restored facilitation, whereas expression of a mutated Syt7
with a calcium-insensitive C2A domain did not. By revealing the role of Syt7 in
synaptic facilitation, these results resolve a longstanding debate about a
widespread form of short-term plasticity, and will enable future studies that may
lead to a deeper understanding of the functional importance of facilitation.

In recent years, several extreme weather disasters have partially or completely
damaged regional crop production. While detailed regional accounts of the effects
of extreme weather disasters exist, the global scale effects of droughts, floods 
and extreme temperature on crop production are yet to be quantified. Here we
estimate for the first time, to our knowledge, national cereal production losses 
across the globe resulting from reported extreme weather disasters during
1964-2007. We show that droughts and extreme heat significantly reduced national 
cereal production by 9-10%, whereas our analysis could not identify an effect
from floods and extreme cold in the national data. Analysing the underlying
processes, we find that production losses due to droughts were associated with a 
reduction in both harvested area and yields, whereas extreme heat mainly
decreased cereal yields. Furthermore, the results highlight ~7% greater
production damage from more recent droughts and 8-11% more damage in developed
countries than in developing ones. Our findings may help to guide agricultural
priorities in international disaster risk reduction and adaptation efforts.

Slab melting as a barrier to deep carbon subduction.

Interactions between crustal and mantle reservoirs dominate the surface inventory
of volatile elements over geological time, moderating atmospheric composition and
maintaining a life-supporting planet. While volcanoes expel volatile components
into surface reservoirs, subduction of oceanic crust is responsible for
replenishment of mantle reservoirs. Many natural, 'superdeep' diamonds
originating in the deep upper mantle and transition zone host mineral inclusions,
indicating an affinity to subducted oceanic crust. Here we show that the majority
of slab geotherms will intersect a deep depression along the melting curve of
carbonated oceanic crust at depths of approximately 300 to 700 kilometres,
creating a barrier to direct carbonate recycling into the deep mantle. Low-degree
partial melts are alkaline carbonatites that are highly reactive with reduced
ambient mantle, producing diamond. Many inclusions in superdeep diamonds are best
explained by carbonate melt-peridotite reaction. A deep carbon barrier may
dominate the recycling of carbon in the mantle and contribute to chemical and
isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle reservoir.

Electroreduction of CO2 into useful fuels, especially if driven by renewable
energy, represents a potentially 'clean' strategy for replacing fossil feedstocks
and dealing with increasing CO2 emissions and their adverse effects on climate.
The critical bottleneck lies in activating CO2 into the CO2(•-) radical anion or 
other intermediates that can be converted further, as the activation usually
requires impractically high overpotentials. Recently, electrocatalysts based on
oxide-derived metal nanostructures have been shown to enable CO2 reduction at low
overpotentials. However, it remains unclear how the electrocatalytic activity of 
these metals is influenced by their native oxides, mainly because microstructural
features such as interfaces and defects influence CO2 reduction activity yet are 
difficult to control. To evaluate the role of the two different catalytic sites, 
here we fabricate two kinds of four-atom-thick layers: pure cobalt metal, and
co-existing domains of cobalt metal and cobalt oxide. Cobalt mainly produces
formate (HCOO(-)) during CO2 electroreduction; we find that surface cobalt atoms 
of the atomically thin layers have higher intrinsic activity and selectivity
towards formate production, at lower overpotentials, than do surface cobalt atoms
on bulk samples. Partial oxidation of the atomic layers further increases their
intrinsic activity, allowing us to realize stable current densities of about 10
milliamperes per square centimetre over 40 hours, with approximately 90 per cent 
formate selectivity at an overpotential of only 0.24 volts, which outperforms
previously reported metal or metal oxide electrodes evaluated under comparable
conditions. The correct morphology and oxidation state can thus transform a
material from one considered nearly non-catalytic for the CO2 electroreduction
reaction into an active catalyst. These findings point to new opportunities for
manipulating and improving the CO2 electroreduction properties of metal systems, 
especially once the influence of both the atomic-scale structure and the presence
of oxide are mechanistically better understood.

Evidence for a new phase of dense hydrogen above 325 gigapascals.

Almost 80 years ago it was predicted that, under sufficient compression, the H-H 
bond in molecular hydrogen (H2) would break, forming a new, atomic, metallic,
solid state of hydrogen. Reaching this predicted state experimentally has been
one of the principal goals in high-pressure research for the past 30 years. Here,
using in situ high-pressure Raman spectroscopy, we present evidence that at
pressures greater than 325 gigapascals at 300 kelvin, H2 and hydrogen deuteride
(HD) transform to a new phase--phase V. This new phase of hydrogen is
characterized by substantial weakening of the vibrational Raman activity, a
change in pressure dependence of the fundamental vibrational frequency and
partial loss of the low-frequency excitations. We map out the domain in
pressure-temperature space of the suggested phase V in H2 and HD up to 388
gigapascals at 300 kelvin, and up to 465 kelvin at 350 gigapascals; we do not
observe phase V in deuterium (D2). However, we show that the transformation to
phase IV' in D2 occurs above 310 gigapascals and 300 kelvin. These values
represent the largest known isotropic shift in pressure, and hence the largest
possible pressure difference between the H2 and D2 phases, which implies that the
appearance of phase V of D2 must occur at a pressure of above 380 gigapascals.
These experimental data provide a glimpse of the physical properties of dense
hydrogen above 325 gigapascals and constrain the pressure and temperature
conditions at which the new phase exists. We speculate that phase V may be the
precursor to the non-molecular (atomic and metallic) state of hydrogen that was
predicted 80 years ago.

How black holes accrete surrounding matter is a fundamental yet unsolved question
in astrophysics. It is generally believed that matter is absorbed into black
holes via accretion disks, the state of which depends primarily on the
mass-accretion rate. When this rate approaches the critical rate (the Eddington
limit), thermal instability is supposed to occur in the inner disk, causing
repetitive patterns of large-amplitude X-ray variability (oscillations) on
timescales of minutes to hours. In fact, such oscillations have been observed
only in sources with a high mass-accretion rate, such as GRS 1915+105 (refs 2,
3). These large-amplitude, relatively slow timescale, phenomena are thought to
have physical origins distinct from those of X-ray or optical variations with
small amplitudes and fast timescales (less than about 10 seconds) often observed 
in other black-hole binaries-for example, XTE J1118+480 (ref. 4) and GX 339-4
(ref. 5). Here we report an extensive multi-colour optical photometric data set
of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient source containing a black hole of nine solar
masses (and a companion star) at a distance of 2.4 kiloparsecs (ref. 8). Our data
show that optical oscillations on timescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can
occur at mass-accretion rates more than ten times lower than previously thought. 
This suggests that the accretion rate is not the critical parameter for inducing 
inner-disk instabilities. Instead, we propose that a long orbital period is a key
condition for these large-amplitude oscillations, because the outer part of the
large disk in binaries with long orbital periods will have surface densities too 
low to maintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disk. The lack 
of sustained accretion--not the actual rate--would then be the critical factor
causing large-amplitude oscillations in long-period systems.

During ageing, muscle stem-cell regenerative function declines. At advanced
geriatric age, this decline is maximal owing to transition from a normal
quiescence into an irreversible senescence state. How satellite cells maintain
quiescence and avoid senescence until advanced age remains unknown. Here we
report that basal autophagy is essential to maintain the stem-cell quiescent
state in mice. Failure of autophagy in physiologically aged satellite cells or
genetic impairment of autophagy in young cells causes entry into senescence by
loss of proteostasis, increased mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress,
resulting in a decline in the function and number of satellite cells.
Re-establishment of autophagy reverses senescence and restores regenerative
functions in geriatric satellite cells. As autophagy also declines in human
geriatric satellite cells, our findings reveal autophagy to be a decisive
stem-cell-fate regulator, with implications for fostering muscle regeneration in 
sarcopenia.

Gain-of-function IDH mutations are initiating events that define major clinical
and prognostic classes of gliomas. Mutant IDH protein produces a new
onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with iron-dependent
hydroxylases, including the TET family of 5'-methylcytosine hydroxylases. TET
enzymes catalyse a key step in the removal of DNA methylation. IDH mutant gliomas
thus manifest a CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), although the functional
importance of this altered epigenetic state remains unclear. Here we show that
human IDH mutant gliomas exhibit hypermethylation at cohesin and CCCTC-binding
factor (CTCF)-binding sites, compromising binding of this methylation-sensitive
insulator protein. Reduced CTCF binding is associated with loss of insulation
between topological domains and aberrant gene activation. We specifically
demonstrate that loss of CTCF at a domain boundary permits a constitutive
enhancer to interact aberrantly with the receptor tyrosine kinase gene PDGFRA, a 
prominent glioma oncogene. Treatment of IDH mutant gliomaspheres with a
demethylating agent partially restores insulator function and downregulates
PDGFRA. Conversely, CRISPR-mediated disruption of the CTCF motif in IDH wild-type
gliomaspheres upregulates PDGFRA and increases proliferation. Our study suggests 
that IDH mutations promote gliomagenesis by disrupting chromosomal topology and
allowing aberrant regulatory interactions that induce oncogene expression.

Plasmodium falciparum antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes 
are important targets of naturally acquired immunity against malaria, but their
high number and variability provide the pathogen with a powerful means of escape 
from host antibodies. Although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens
could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design, their identification has
proven elusive. Here we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that 
recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize 
these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired 
broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment
between the V and DJ segments. The insert, which is both necessary and sufficient
for binding to RIFINs, encodes the entire 98 amino acid collagen-binding domain
of LAIR1, an immunoglobulin superfamily inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome
19. In each of the two donors studied, the antibodies are produced by a single
expanded B-cell clone and carry distinct somatic mutations in the LAIR1 domain
that abolish binding to collagen and increase binding to infected erythrocytes.
These findings illustrate, with a biologically relevant example, a novel
mechanism of antibody diversification by interchromosomal DNA transposition and
demonstrate the existence of conserved epitopes that may be suitable candidates
for the development of a malaria vaccine.

Colorectal cancer remains a major unmet medical need, prompting large-scale
genomics efforts in the field to identify molecular drivers for which targeted
therapies might be developed. We previously reported the identification of
recurrent translocations in R-spondin genes present in a subset of colorectal
tumours. Here we show that targeting RSPO3 in PTPRK-RSPO3-fusion-positive human
tumour xenografts inhibits tumour growth and promotes differentiation. Notably,
genes expressed in the stem-cell compartment of the intestine were among those
most sensitive to anti-RSPO3 treatment. This observation, combined with
functional assays, suggests that a stem-cell compartment drives PTPRK-RSPO3
colorectal tumour growth and indicates that the therapeutic targeting of
stem-cell properties within tumours may be a clinically relevant approach for the
treatment of colorectal tumours.

The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) subunit
POLR2A is a platform for modifications specifying the recruitment of factors that
regulate transcription, mRNA processing, and chromatin remodelling. Here we show 
that a CTD arginine residue (R1810 in human) that is conserved across vertebrates
is symmetrically dimethylated (me2s). This R1810me2s modification requires
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and recruits the Tudor domain of the
survival of motor neuron (SMN, also known as GEMIN1) protein, which is mutated in
spinal muscular atrophy. SMN interacts with senataxin, which is sometimes mutated
in ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because
POLR2A R1810me2s and SMN, like senataxin, are required for resolving RNA-DNA
hybrids created by RNA polymerase II that form R-loops in transcription
termination regions, we propose that R1810me2s, SMN, and senataxin are components
of an R-loop resolution pathway. Defects in this pathway can influence
transcription termination and may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders.

Carbon dioxide is the ultimate source of the fossil fuels that are both central
to modern life and problematic: their use increases atmospheric levels of
greenhouse gases, and their availability is geopolitically constrained. Using
carbon dioxide as a feedstock to produce synthetic fuels might, in principle,
alleviate these concerns. Although many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts
convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, further deoxygenative coupling of
carbon monoxide to generate useful multicarbon products is challenging.
Molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases are capable of converting carbon monoxide
into hydrocarbons under mild conditions, using discrete electron and proton
sources. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide on copper catalysts also
uses a combination of electrons and protons, while the industrial Fischer-Tropsch
process uses dihydrogen as a combined source of electrons and electrophiles for
carbon monoxide coupling at high temperatures and pressures. However, these
enzymatic and heterogeneous systems are difficult to probe mechanistically.
Molecular catalysts have been studied extensively to investigate the elementary
steps by which carbon monoxide is deoxygenated and coupled, but a single metal
site that can efficiently induce the required scission of carbon-oxygen bonds and
generate carbon-carbon bonds has not yet been documented. Here we describe a
molybdenum compound, supported by a terphenyl-diphosphine ligand, that activates 
and cleaves the strong carbon-oxygen bond of carbon monoxide, enacts
carbon-carbon coupling, and spontaneously dissociates the resulting fragment.
This complex four-electron transformation is enabled by the terphenyl-diphosphine
ligand, which acts as an electron reservoir and exhibits the coordinative
flexibility needed to stabilize the different intermediates involved in the
overall reaction sequence. We anticipate that these design elements might help in
the development of efficient catalysts for converting carbon monoxide to chemical
fuels, and should prove useful in the broader context of performing complex
multi-electron transformations at a single metal site.

Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of
their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and
data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1-1.7 micrometres). 
Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water
absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low
amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances,
which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the
planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion
can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of
obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report 
results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength
range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering
and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse
group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. 
We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and 
infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different
atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, 
so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and
the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly
suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that
clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.

Understanding how ecological communities are organized and how they change
through time is critical to predicting the effects of climate change. Recent work
documenting the co-occurrence structure of modern communities found that most
significant species pairs co-occur less frequently than would be expected by
chance. However, little is known about how co-occurrence structure changes
through time. Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization
over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique
taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences
of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were
spatially aggregated or segregated. Aggregated pairs dominated from the
Carboniferous period (307 million years ago) to the early Holocene epoch (11,700 
years before present), when there was a pronounced shift to more segregated
pairs, a trend that continues in modern assemblages. The shift began during the
Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size and the spread of
agriculture in North America. Before the shift, an average of 64% of significant 
pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37%. The
organization of modern and late Holocene plant and animal assemblages differs
fundamentally from that of assemblages over the past 300 million years that
predate the large-scale impacts of humans. Our results suggest that the rules
governing the assembly of communities have recently been changed by human
activity.

Recent research has highlighted a strong correlation between tissue-specific
cancer risk and the lifetime number of tissue-specific stem-cell divisions.
Whether such correlation implies a high unavoidable intrinsic cancer risk has
become a key public health debate with the dissemination of the 'bad luck'
hypothesis. Here we provide evidence that intrinsic risk factors contribute only 
modestly (less than ~10-30% of lifetime risk) to cancer development. First, we
demonstrate that the correlation between stem-cell division and cancer risk does 
not distinguish between the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We then
show that intrinsic risk is better estimated by the lower bound risk controlling 
for total stem-cell divisions. Finally, we show that the rates of endogenous
mutation accumulation by intrinsic processes are not sufficient to account for
the observed cancer risks. Collectively, we conclude that cancer risk is heavily 
influenced by extrinsic factors. These results are important for strategizing
cancer prevention, research and public health.

Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) is a critical regulator of an
organism's most important biological decisions from growth, development, and
metabolism to reproduction and longevity. It primarily does so through the
activity of the DAF-16 transcription factor (forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue),
whose global targets were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans using whole-worm
transcriptional analyses more than a decade ago. IIS and FOXO also regulate
important neuronal and adult behavioural phenotypes, such as the maintenance of
memory and axon regeneration with age, in both mammals and C. elegans, but the
neuron-specific IIS/FOXO targets that regulate these functions are still unknown.
By isolating adult C. elegans neurons for transcriptional profiling, we
identified both the wild-type and IIS/FOXO mutant adult neuronal transcriptomes
for the first time. IIS/FOXO neuron-specific targets are distinct from canonical 
IIS/FOXO-regulated longevity and metabolism targets, and are required for
extended memory in IIS daf-2 mutants. The activity of the forkhead transcription 
factor FKH-9 in neurons is required for the ability of daf-2 mutants to
regenerate axons with age, and its activity in non-neuronal tissues is required
for the long lifespan of daf-2 mutants. Together, neuron-specific and canonical
IIS/FOXO-regulated targets enable the coordinated extension of neuronal
activities, metabolism, and longevity under low-insulin signalling conditions.
