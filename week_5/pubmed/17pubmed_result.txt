Piezo1 and Piezo2 are mechanically activated ion channels that mediate touch
perception, proprioception and vascular development. Piezo proteins are distinct 
from other ion channels and their structure remains poorly defined, which impedes
detailed study of their gating and ion permeation properties. Here we report a
high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the mouse Piezo1 trimer.
The detergent-solubilized complex adopts a three-bladed propeller shape with a
curved transmembrane region containing at least 26 transmembrane helices per
protomer. The flexible propeller blades can adopt distinct conformations, and
consist of a series of four-transmembrane helical bundles that we term Piezo
repeats. Carboxy-terminal domains line the central ion pore, and the channel is
closed by constrictions in the cytosol. A kinked helical beam and anchor domain
link the Piezo repeats to the pore, and are poised to control gating
allosterically. The structure provides a foundation to dissect further how Piezo 
channels are regulated by mechanical force.

GW170817 was the first gravitational-wave detection of a binary neutron-star
merger. It was accompanied by radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum and
localized to the galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. It has been
proposed that the observed γ-ray, X-ray and radio emission is due to an
ultra-relativistic jet being launched during the merger (and successfully
breaking out of the surrounding material), directed away from our line of sight
(off-axis). The presence of such a jet is predicted from models that posit
neutron-star mergers as the drivers of short hard-γ-ray bursts. Here we report
that the radio light curve of GW170817 has no direct signature of the afterglow
of an off-axis jet. Although we cannot completely rule out the existence of a jet
directed away from the line of sight, the observed γ-ray emission could not have 
originated from such a jet. Instead, the radio data require the existence of a
mildly relativistic wide-angle outflow moving towards us. This outflow could be
the high-velocity tail of the neutron-rich material that was ejected dynamically 
during the merger, or a cocoon of material that breaks out when a jet launched
during the merger transfers its energy to the dynamical ejecta. Because the
cocoon model explains the radio light curve of GW170817, as well as the γ-ray and
X-ray emission (and possibly also the ultraviolet and optical emission), it is
the model that is most consistent with the observational data. Cocoons may be a
ubiquitous phenomenon produced in neutron-star mergers, giving rise to a hitherto
unidentified population of radio, ultraviolet, X-ray and γ-ray transients in the 
local Universe.

The angle between the spin of a star and the orbital planes of its planets traces
the history of the planetary system. Exoplanets orbiting close to cool stars are 
expected to be on circular, aligned orbits because of strong tidal interactions
with the stellar convective envelope. Spin-orbit alignment can be measured when
the planet transits its star, but such ground-based spectroscopic measurements
are challenging for cool, slowly rotating stars. Here we report the
three-dimensional characterization of the trajectory of an exoplanet around an M 
dwarf star, derived by mapping the spectrum of the stellar photosphere along the 
chord transited by the planet. We find that the eccentric orbit of the
Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b is nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator.
Both eccentricity and misalignment, surprising around a cool star, can result
from dynamical interactions (via Kozai migration) with a yet-undetected outer
companion. This inward migration of GJ 436b could have triggered the atmospheric 
escape that now sustains its giant exosphere.

Quasars are the most luminous non-transient objects known and as a result they
enable studies of the Universe at the earliest cosmic epochs. Despite extensive
efforts, however, the quasar ULAS J1120 + 0641 at redshift z = 7.09 has remained 
the only one known at z > 7 for more than half a decade. Here we report
observations of the quasar ULAS J134208.10 + 092838.61 (hereafter J1342 + 0928)
at redshift z = 7.54. This quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 4 × 1013 times
the luminosity of the Sun and a black-hole mass of 8 × 108 solar masses. The
existence of this supermassive black hole when the Universe was only 690 million 
years old-just five per cent of its current age-reinforces models of early
black-hole growth that allow black holes with initial masses of more than about
104 solar masses or episodic hyper-Eddington accretion. We see strong evidence of
absorption of the spectrum of the quasar redwards of the Lyman α emission line
(the Gunn-Peterson damping wing), as would be expected if a significant amount
(more than 10 per cent) of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium surrounding
J1342 + 0928 is neutral. We derive such a significant fraction of neutral
hydrogen, although the exact fraction depends on the modelling. However, even in 
our most conservative analysis we find a fraction of more than 0.33 (0.11) at 68 
per cent (95 per cent) probability, indicating that we are probing well within
the reionization epoch of the Universe.

Convection plays a major part in many astrophysical processes, including energy
transport, pulsation, dynamos and winds on evolved stars, in dust clouds and on
brown dwarfs. Most of our knowledge about stellar convection has come from
studying the Sun: about two million convective cells with typical sizes of around
2,000 kilometres across are present on the surface of the Sun-a phenomenon known 
as granulation. But on the surfaces of giant and supergiant stars there should be
only a few large (several tens of thousands of times larger than those on the
Sun) convective cells, owing to low surface gravity. Deriving the characteristic 
properties of convection (such as granule size and contrast) for the most evolved
giant and supergiant stars is challenging because their photospheres are obscured
by dust, which partially masks the convective patterns. These properties can be
inferred from geometric model fitting, but this indirect method does not provide 
information about the physical origin of the convective cells. Here we report
interferometric images of the surface of the evolved giant star π1 Gruis, of
spectral type S5,7. Our images show a nearly circular, dust-free atmosphere,
which is very compact and only weakly affected by molecular opacity. We find that
the stellar surface has a complex convective pattern with an average intensity
contrast of 12 per cent, which increases towards shorter wavelengths. We derive a
characteristic horizontal granule size of about 1.2 × 1011 metres, which
corresponds to 27 per cent of the diameter of the star. Our measurements fall
along the scaling relations between granule size, effective temperature and
surface gravity that are predicted by simulations of stellar surface convection.

Although genetic factors contribute to almost half of all cases of deafness,
treatment options for genetic deafness are limited. We developed a genome-editing
approach to target a dominantly inherited form of genetic deafness. Here we show 
that cationic lipid-mediated in vivo delivery of Cas9-guide RNA complexes can
ameliorate hearing loss in a mouse model of human genetic deafness. We designed
and validated, both in vitro and in primary fibroblasts, genome editing agents
that preferentially disrupt the dominant deafness-associated allele in the Tmc1
(transmembrane channel-like gene family 1) Beethoven (Bth) mouse model, even
though the mutant Tmc1Bth allele differs from the wild-type allele at only a
single base pair. Injection of Cas9-guide RNA-lipid complexes targeting the
Tmc1Bth allele into the cochlea of neonatal Tmc1Bth/+ mice substantially reduced 
progressive hearing loss. We observed higher hair cell survival rates and lower
auditory brainstem response thresholds in injected ears than in uninjected ears
or ears injected with control complexes that targeted an unrelated gene. Enhanced
acoustic startle responses were observed among injected compared to uninjected
Tmc1Bth/+ mice. These findings suggest that protein-RNA complex delivery of
target gene-disrupting agents in vivo is a potential strategy for the treatment
of some types of autosomal-dominant hearing loss.

Understanding global patterns of biodiversity change is crucial for conservation 
research, policies and practices. However, for most ecosystems, the lack of
systematically collected data at a global level limits our understanding of
biodiversity changes and their local-scale drivers. Here we address this
challenge by focusing on wetlands, which are among the most biodiverse and
productive of any environments and which provide essential ecosystem services,
but are also amongst the most seriously threatened ecosystems. Using birds as an 
indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, we model time-series abundance data for 
461 waterbird species at 25,769 survey sites across the globe. We show that the
strongest predictor of changes in waterbird abundance, and of conservation
efforts having beneficial effects, is the effective governance of a country. In
areas in which governance is on average less effective, such as western and
central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, waterbird declines are
particularly pronounced; a higher protected area coverage of wetland environments
facilitates waterbird increases, but only in countries with more effective
governance. Our findings highlight that sociopolitical instability can lead to
biodiversity loss and undermine the benefit of existing conservation efforts,
such as the expansion of protected area coverage. Furthermore, data deficiencies 
in areas with less effective governance could lead to underestimations of the
extent of the current biodiversity crisis.

Calcium-selective transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6
(TRPV6) channels play a critical role in calcium uptake in epithelial tissues.
Altered TRPV6 expression is associated with a variety of human diseases,
including cancers. TRPV6 channels are constitutively active and their open
probability depends on the lipidic composition of the membrane in which they
reside; it increases substantially in the presence of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate. Crystal structures of detergent-solubilized rat TRPV6 in the
closed state have previously been solved. Corroborating electrophysiological
results, these structures demonstrated that the Ca2+ selectivity of TRPV6 arises 
from a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter that binds Ca2+
tightly. However, how TRPV6 channels open and close their pores for ion
permeation has remained unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy
structures of human TRPV6 in the open and closed states. The channel selectivity 
filter adopts similar conformations in both states, consistent with its explicit 
role in ion permeation. The iris-like channel opening is accompanied by an
α-to-π-helical transition in the pore-lining transmembrane helix S6 at an alanine
hinge just below the selectivity filter. As a result of this transition, the S6
helices bend and rotate, exposing different residues to the ion channel pore in
the open and closed states. This gating mechanism, which defines the constitutive
activity of TRPV6, is, to our knowledge, unique among tetrameric ion channels and
provides structural insights for understanding their diverse roles in physiology 
and disease.

Fire frequency is changing globally and is projected to affect the global carbon 
cycle and climate. However, uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal
changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered
fire regimes on the carbon cycle; for instance, we do not fully understand the
long-term effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage, or whether
fire-driven nutrient losses limit plant productivity. Here we analyse data from
48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning
up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each
site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil 
carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent (±13
per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent (±16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years
than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses 
were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in
temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon
and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model
simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term
losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn
decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20
per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same
period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on
ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include
multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands.
Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing
soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon
sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests.

Transposable elements, also known as transposons, are now recognized not only as 
parasitic DNA, the spread of which in the genome must be controlled by the host, 
but also as major players in genome evolution and regulation. Long interspersed
element-1 (LINE-1, also known as L1), the only currently autonomous mobile
transposon in humans, occupies 17% of the genome and generates inter- and
intra-individual genetic variation, in some cases resulting in disease. However, 
how L1 activity is controlled and the function of L1s in host gene regulation are
not completely understood. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 screening strategies in two
distinct human cell lines to provide a genome-wide survey of genes involved in
the control of L1 retrotransposition. We identify functionally diverse genes that
either promote or restrict L1 retrotransposition. These genes, which are often
associated with human diseases, control the L1 life cycle at the transcriptional 
or the post-transcriptional level in a manner that can depend on the endogenous
L1 nucleotide sequence, underscoring the complexity of L1 regulation. We further 
investigate the restriction of L1 by the protein MORC2 and by the human silencing
hub (HUSH) complex subunits MPP8 and TASOR. HUSH and MORC2 can selectively bind
evolutionarily young, full-length L1s located within transcriptionally permissive
euchromatic environments, and promote deposition of histone H3 Lys9
trimethylation (H3K9me3) for transcriptional silencing. Notably, these silencing 
events often occur within introns of transcriptionally active genes, and lead to 
the downregulation of host gene expression in a HUSH-, MORC2-, and L1-dependent
manner. Together, these results provide a rich resource for studies of L1
retrotransposition, elucidate a novel L1 restriction pathway and illustrate how
epigenetic silencing of transposable elements rewires host gene expression
programs.

Genomic sequencing has driven precision-based oncology therapy; however, the
genetic drivers of many malignancies remain unknown or non-targetable, so
alternative approaches to the identification of therapeutic leads are necessary. 
Ependymomas are chemotherapy-resistant brain tumours, which, despite genomic
sequencing, lack effective molecular targets. Intracranial ependymomas are
segregated on the basis of anatomical location (supratentorial region or
posterior fossa) and further divided into distinct molecular subgroups that
reflect differences in the age of onset, gender predominance and response to
therapy. The most common and aggressive subgroup, posterior fossa ependymoma
group A (PF-EPN-A), occurs in young children and appears to lack recurrent
somatic mutations. Conversely, posterior fossa ependymoma group B (PF-EPN-B)
tumours display frequent large-scale copy number gains and losses but have
favourable clinical outcomes. More than 70% of supratentorial ependymomas are
defined by highly recurrent gene fusions in the NF-κB subunit gene RELA
(ST-EPN-RELA), and a smaller number involve fusion of the gene encoding the
transcriptional activator YAP1 (ST-EPN-YAP1). Subependymomas, a distinct
histologic variant, can also be found within the supratetorial and posterior
fossa compartments, and account for the majority of tumours in the molecular
subgroups ST-EPN-SE and PF-EPN-SE. Here we describe mapping of active chromatin
landscapes in 42 primary ependymomas in two non-overlapping primary ependymoma
cohorts, with the goal of identifying essential super-enhancer-associated genes
on which tumour cells depend. Enhancer regions revealed putative oncogenes,
molecular targets and pathways; inhibition of these targets with small molecule
inhibitors or short hairpin RNA diminished the proliferation of patient-derived
neurospheres and increased survival in mouse models of ependymomas. Through
profiling of transcriptional enhancers, our study provides a framework for target
and drug discovery in other cancers that lack known genetic drivers and are
therefore difficult to treat.

Cellular senescence is a stress-responsive cell-cycle arrest program that
terminates the further expansion of (pre-)malignant cells. Key signalling
components of the senescence machinery, such as p16INK4a, p21CIP1 and p53, as
well as trimethylation of lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3K9me3), also operate as
critical regulators of stem-cell functions (which are collectively termed
'stemness'). In cancer cells, a gain of stemness may have profound implications
for tumour aggressiveness and clinical outcome. Here we investigated whether
chemotherapy-induced senescence could change stem-cell-related properties of
malignant cells. Gene expression and functional analyses comparing senescent and 
non-senescent B-cell lymphomas from Eμ-Myc transgenic mice revealed substantial
upregulation of an adult tissue stem-cell signature, activated Wnt signalling,
and distinct stem-cell markers in senescence. Using genetically switchable models
of senescence targeting H3K9me3 or p53 to mimic spontaneous escape from the
arrested condition, we found that cells released from senescence re-entered the
cell cycle with strongly enhanced and Wnt-dependent clonogenic growth potential
compared to virtually identical populations that had been equally exposed to
chemotherapy but had never been senescent. In vivo, these previously senescent
cells presented with a much higher tumour initiation potential. Notably, the
temporary enforcement of senescence in p53-regulatable models of acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia was found to reprogram
non-stem bulk leukaemia cells into self-renewing, leukaemia-initiating stem
cells. Our data, which are further supported by consistent results in human
cancer cell lines and primary samples of human haematological malignancies,
reveal that senescence-associated stemness is an unexpected, cell-autonomous
feature that exerts its detrimental, highly aggressive growth potential upon
escape from cell-cycle blockade, and is enriched in relapse tumours. These
findings have profound implications for cancer therapy, and provide new
mechanistic insights into the plasticity of cancer cells.

Designing materials to function in harsh environments, such as conductive aqueous
media, is a problem of broad interest to a range of technologies, including
energy, ocean monitoring and biological applications. The main challenge is to
retain the stability and morphology of the material as it interacts dynamically
with the surrounding environment. Materials that respond to mild stimuli through 
collective phase transitions and amplify signals could open up new avenues for
sensing. Here we present the discovery of an electric-field-driven,
water-mediated reversible phase change in a perovskite-structured nickelate,
SmNiO3. This prototypical strongly correlated quantum material is stable in salt 
water, does not corrode, and allows exchange of protons with the surrounding
water at ambient temperature, with the concurrent modification in electrical
resistance and optical properties being capable of multi-modal readout. Besides
operating both as thermistors and pH sensors, devices made of this material can
detect sub-volt electric potentials in salt water. We postulate that such devices
could be used in oceanic environments for monitoring electrical signals from
various maritime vessels and sea creatures.

Carbon stocks in vegetation have a key role in the climate system. However, the
magnitude, patterns and uncertainties of carbon stocks and the effect of land use
on the stocks remain poorly quantified. Here we show, using state-of-the-art
datasets, that vegetation currently stores around 450 petagrams of carbon. In the
hypothetical absence of land use, potential vegetation would store around 916
petagrams of carbon, under current climate conditions. This difference highlights
the massive effect of land use on biomass stocks. Deforestation and other
land-cover changes are responsible for 53-58% of the difference between current
and potential biomass stocks. Land management effects (the biomass stock changes 
induced by land use within the same land cover) contribute 42-47%, but have been 
underestimated in the literature. Therefore, avoiding deforestation is necessary 
but not sufficient for mitigation of climate change. Our results imply that
trade-offs exist between conserving carbon stocks on managed land and raising the
contribution of biomass to raw material and energy supply for the mitigation of
climate change. Efforts to raise biomass stocks are currently verifiable only in 
temperate forests, where their potential is limited. By contrast, large
uncertainties hinder verification in the tropical forest, where the largest
potential is located, pointing to challenges for the upcoming stocktaking
exercises under the Paris agreement.

It has been hypothesized that a condensed nervous system with a medial ventral
nerve cord is an ancestral character of Bilateria. The presence of similar
dorsoventral molecular patterns along the nerve cords of vertebrates, flies, and 
an annelid has been interpreted as support for this scenario. Whether these
similarities are generally found across the diversity of bilaterian
neuroanatomies is unclear, and thus the evolutionary history of the nervous
system is still contentious. Here we study representatives of Xenacoelomorpha,
Rotifera, Nemertea, Brachiopoda, and Annelida to assess the conservation of the
dorsoventral nerve cord patterning. None of the studied species show a conserved 
dorsoventral molecular regionalization of their nerve cords, not even the annelid
Owenia fusiformis, whose trunk neuroanatomy parallels that of vertebrates and
flies. Our findings restrict the use of molecular patterns to explain nervous
system evolution, and suggest that the similarities in dorsoventral patterning
and trunk neuroanatomies evolved independently in Bilateria.

According to the current understanding of cosmic structure formation, the
precursors of the most massive structures in the Universe began to form shortly
after the Big Bang, in regions corresponding to the largest fluctuations in the
cosmic density field. Observing these structures during their period of active
growth and assembly-the first few hundred million years of the Universe-is
challenging because it requires surveys that are sensitive enough to detect the
distant galaxies that act as signposts for these structures and wide enough to
capture the rarest objects. As a result, very few such objects have been detected
so far. Here we report observations of a far-infrared-luminous object at redshift
6.900 (less than 800 million years after the Big Bang) that was discovered in a
wide-field survey. High-resolution imaging shows it to be a pair of extremely
massive star-forming galaxies. The larger is forming stars at a rate of 2,900
solar masses per year, contains 270 billion solar masses of gas and 2.5 billion
solar masses of dust, and is more massive than any other known object at a
redshift of more than 6. Its rapid star formation is probably triggered by its
companion galaxy at a projected separation of 8 kiloparsecs. This merging
companion hosts 35 billion solar masses of stars and has a star-formation rate of
540 solar masses per year, but has an order of magnitude less gas and dust than
its neighbour and physical conditions akin to those observed in lower-metallicity
galaxies in the nearby Universe. These objects suggest the presence of a
dark-matter halo with a mass of more than 100 billion solar masses, making it
among the rarest dark-matter haloes that should exist in the Universe at this
epoch.

Treatments that target immune checkpoints, such as the one mediated by programmed
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, have been approved for treating
human cancers with durable clinical benefit. However, many patients with cancer
fail to respond to compounds that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, and the 
underlying mechanism(s) is not well understood. Recent studies revealed that
response to PD-1-PD-L1 blockade might correlate with PD-L1 expression levels in
tumour cells. Hence, it is important to understand the mechanistic pathways that 
control PD-L1 protein expression and stability, which can offer a molecular basis
to improve the clinical response rate and efficacy of PD-1-PD-L1 blockade in
patients with cancer. Here we show that PD-L1 protein abundance is regulated by
cyclin D-CDK4 and the cullin 3-SPOP E3 ligase via proteasome-mediated
degradation. Inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 (hereafter CDK4/6) in vivo increases
PD-L1 protein levels by impeding cyclin D-CDK4-mediated phosphorylation of
speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) and thereby promoting SPOP degradation by the
anaphase-promoting complex activator FZR1. Loss-of-function mutations in SPOP
compromise ubiquitination-mediated PD-L1 degradation, leading to increased PD-L1 
levels and reduced numbers of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in mouse tumours
and in primary human prostate cancer specimens. Notably, combining CDK4/6
inhibitor treatment with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy enhances tumour regression and
markedly improves overall survival rates in mouse tumour models. Our study
uncovers a novel molecular mechanism for regulating PD-L1 protein stability by a 
cell cycle kinase and reveals the potential for using combination treatment with 
CDK4/6 inhibitors and PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade to enhance
therapeutic efficacy for human cancers.

Vesicular carriers transport proteins and lipids from one organelle to another,
recognizing specific identifiers for the donor and acceptor membranes. Two
important identifiers are phosphoinositides and GTP-bound GTPases, which provide 
well-defined but mutable labels. Phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated
derivatives are present on the cytosolic faces of most cellular membranes.
Reversible phosphorylation of its headgroup produces seven distinct
phosphoinositides. In endocytic traffic, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
marks the plasma membrane, and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate mark distinct endosomal compartments. It is
unknown what sequence of changes in lipid content confers on the vesicles their
distinct identity at each intermediate step. Here we describe
'coincidence-detecting' sensors that selectively report the phosphoinositide
composition of clathrin-associated structures, and the use of these sensors to
follow the dynamics of phosphoinositide conversion during endocytosis. The
membrane of an assembling coated pit, in equilibrium with the surrounding plasma 
membrane, contains phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate and a smaller amount of
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Closure of the vesicle interrupts free exchange
with the plasma membrane. A substantial burst of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
immediately after budding coincides with a burst of
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, distinct from any later encounter with the
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate pool in early endosomes;
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate and the GTPase Rab5 then appear and remain
as the uncoating vesicles mature into Rab5-positive endocytic intermediates. Our 
observations show that a cascade of molecular conversions, made possible by the
separation of a vesicle from its parent membrane, can label membrane-traffic
intermediates and determine their destinations.

The Galaxy is filled with cosmic-ray particles, mostly protons with kinetic
energies greater than hundreds of megaelectronvolts. Around Earth, trapped
energetic protons, electrons and other particles circulate at altitudes from
about 500 to 40,000 kilometres in the Van Allen radiation belts. Soon after these
radiation belts were discovered six decades ago, it was recognized that the main 
source of inner-belt protons (with kinetic energies of tens to hundreds of
megaelectronvolts) is cosmic-ray albedo neutron decay (CRAND). In this process,
cosmic rays that reach the upper atmosphere interact with neutral atoms to
produce albedo neutrons, which, being prone to β-decay, are a possible source of 
geomagnetically trapped protons and electrons. These protons would retain most of
the kinetic energy of the neutrons, while the electrons would have lower
energies, mostly less than one megaelectronvolt. The viability of CRAND as an
electron source has, however, been uncertain, because measurements have shown
that the electron intensity in the inner Van Allen belt can vary greatly, while
the neutron-decay rate should be almost constant. Here we report measurements of 
relativistic electrons near the inner edge of the inner radiation belt. We
demonstrate that the main source of these electrons is indeed CRAND, and that
this process also contributes to electrons in the inner belt elsewhere.
Furthermore, measurement of the intensity of electrons generated by CRAND
provides an experimental determination of the neutron density in near-Earth
space-2 × 10-9 per cubic centimetre-confirming theoretical estimates.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and
metabolism in response to nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors. It
contains the atypical kinase mTOR and the RAPTOR subunit that binds to the Tor
signalling sequence (TOS) motif of substrates and regulators. mTORC1 is activated
by the small GTPase RHEB (Ras homologue enriched in brain) and inhibited by
PRAS40. Here we present the 3.0 ångström cryo-electron microscopy structure of
mTORC1 and the 3.4 ångström structure of activated RHEB-mTORC1. RHEB binds to
mTOR distally from the kinase active site, yet causes a global conformational
change that allosterically realigns active-site residues, accelerating catalysis.
Cancer-associated hyperactivating mutations map to structural elements that
maintain the inactive state, and we provide biochemical evidence that they mimic 
RHEB relieving auto-inhibition. We also present crystal structures of RAPTOR-TOS 
motif complexes that define the determinants of TOS recognition, of an mTOR
FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain-substrate complex that establishes a second
substrate-recruitment mechanism, and of a truncated mTOR-PRAS40 complex that
reveals PRAS40 inhibits both substrate-recruitment sites. These findings help
explain how mTORC1 selects its substrates, how its kinase activity is controlled,
and how it is activated by cancer-associated mutations.

Activation mechanism of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A revealed

The calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A is a ligand-gated anion channel
that opens in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The
protein is broadly expressed and contributes to diverse physiological processes, 
including transepithelial chloride transport and the control of electrical
signalling in smooth muscles and certain neurons. As a member of the TMEM16 (or
anoctamin) family of membrane proteins, TMEM16A is closely related to paralogues 
that function as scramblases, which facilitate the bidirectional movement of
lipids across membranes. The unusual functional diversity of the TMEM16 family
and the relationship between two seemingly incompatible transport mechanisms has 
been the focus of recent investigations. Previous breakthroughs were obtained
from the X-ray structure of the lipid scramblase of the fungus Nectria
haematococca (nhTMEM16), and from the cryo-electron microscopy structure of mouse
TMEM16A at 6.6 Å (ref. 14). Although the latter structure disclosed the
architectural differences that distinguish ion channels from lipid scramblases,
its low resolution did not permit a detailed molecular description of the protein
or provide any insight into its activation by Ca2+. Here we describe the
structures of mouse TMEM16A at high resolution in the presence and absence of
Ca2+. These structures reveal the differences between ligand-bound and
ligand-free states of a calcium-activated chloride channel, and when combined
with functional experiments suggest a mechanism for gating. During activation,
the binding of Ca2+ to a site located within the transmembrane domain, in the
vicinity of the pore, alters the electrostatic properties of the ion conduction
path and triggers a conformational rearrangement of an α-helix that comes into
physical contact with the bound ligand, and thereby directly couples ligand
binding and pore opening. Our study describes a process that is unique among
channel proteins, but one that is presumably general for both functional branches
of the TMEM16 family.

The challenges of evolution in a complex biochemical environment, coupling
genotype to phenotype and protecting the genetic material, are solved elegantly
in biological systems by the encapsulation of nucleic acids. In the simplest
examples, viruses use capsids to surround their genomes. Although these naturally
occurring systems have been modified to change their tropism and to display
proteins or peptides, billions of years of evolution have favoured efficiency at 
the expense of modularity, making viral capsids difficult to engineer. Synthetic 
systems composed of non-viral proteins could provide a 'blank slate' to evolve
desired properties for drug delivery and other biomedical applications, while
avoiding the safety risks and engineering challenges associated with viruses.
Here we create synthetic nucleocapsids, which are computationally designed
icosahedral protein assemblies with positively charged inner surfaces that can
package their own full-length mRNA genomes. We explore the ability of these
nucleocapsids to evolve virus-like properties by generating diversified
populations using Escherichia coli as an expression host. Several generations of 
evolution resulted in markedly improved genome packaging (more than 133-fold),
stability in blood (from less than 3.7% to 71% of packaged RNA protected after
6 hours of treatment), and in vivo circulation time (from less than 5 minutes to 
approximately 4.5 hours). The resulting synthetic nucleocapsids package one
full-length RNA genome for every 11 icosahedral assemblies, similar to the best
recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. Our results show that there are
simple evolutionary paths through which protein assemblies can acquire virus-like
genome packaging and protection. Considerable effort has been directed at
'top-down' modification of viruses to be safe and effective for drug delivery and
vaccine applications; the ability to design synthetic nanomaterials
computationally and to optimize them through evolution now enables a
complementary 'bottom-up' approach with considerable advantages in
programmability and control.

The differentiation of human memory CD8 T cells is not well understood. Here we
address this issue using the live yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine, which induces
long-term immunity in humans. We used in vivo deuterium labelling to mark CD8 T
cells that proliferated in response to the virus and then assessed cellular
turnover and longevity by quantifying deuterium dilution kinetics in YFV-specific
CD8 T cells using mass spectrometry. This longitudinal analysis showed that the
memory pool originates from CD8 T cells that divided extensively during the first
two weeks after infection and is maintained by quiescent cells that divide less
than once every year (doubling time of over 450 days). Although these long-lived 
YFV-specific memory CD8 T cells did not express effector molecules, their
epigenetic landscape resembled that of effector CD8 T cells. This open chromatin 
profile at effector genes was maintained in memory CD8 T cells isolated even a
decade after vaccination, indicating that these cells retain an epigenetic
fingerprint of their effector history and remain poised to respond rapidly upon
re-exposure to the pathogen.

Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) encoded by TMEM16A control neuronal
signalling, smooth muscle contraction, airway and exocrine gland secretion, and
rhythmic movements of the gastrointestinal system. To understand how CaCCs
mediate and control anion permeation to fulfil these physiological functions,
knowledge of the mammalian TMEM16A structure and identification of its
pore-lining residues are essential. TMEM16A forms a dimer with two pores.
Previous CaCC structural analyses have relied on homology modelling of a
homologue (nhTMEM16) from the fungus Nectria haematococca that functions
primarily as a lipid scramblase, as well as subnanometre-resolution electron
cryo-microscopy. Here we present de novo atomic structures of the transmembrane
domains of mouse TMEM16A in nanodiscs and in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol as
determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. These structures reveal
the ion permeation pore and represent different functional states. The structure 
in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol has one Ca2+ ion resolved within each monomer 
with a constricted pore; this is likely to correspond to a closed state, because 
a CaCC with a single Ca2+ occupancy requires membrane depolarization in order to 
open (C.J.P. et al., manuscript submitted). The structure in nanodiscs has two
Ca2+ ions per monomer and its pore is in a closed conformation; this probably
reflects channel rundown, which is the gradual loss of channel activity that
follows prolonged CaCC activation in 1 mM Ca2+. Our mutagenesis and
electrophysiological studies, prompted by analyses of the structures, identified 
ten residues distributed along the pore that interact with permeant anions and
affect anion selectivity, as well as seven pore-lining residues that cluster near
pore constrictions and regulate channel gating. Together, these results clarify
the basis of CaCC anion conduction.

Memory CD8 T cells that circulate in the blood and are present in lymphoid organs
are an essential component of long-lived T cell immunity. These memory CD8 T
cells remain poised to rapidly elaborate effector functions upon re-exposure to
pathogens, but also have many properties in common with naive cells, including
pluripotency and the ability to migrate to the lymph nodes and spleen. Thus,
memory cells embody features of both naive and effector cells, fuelling a
long-standing debate centred on whether memory T cells develop from effector
cells or directly from naive cells. Here we show that long-lived memory CD8 T
cells are derived from a subset of effector T cells through a process of
dedifferentiation. To assess the developmental origin of memory CD8 T cells, we
investigated changes in DNA methylation programming at naive and effector
cell-associated genes in virus-specific CD8 T cells during acute lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus infection in mice. Methylation profiling of terminal
effector versus memory-precursor CD8 T cell subsets showed that, rather than
retaining a naive epigenetic state, the subset of cells that gives rise to memory
cells acquired de novo DNA methylation programs at naive-associated genes and
became demethylated at the loci of classically defined effector molecules.
Conditional deletion of the de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3a at an early stage of
effector differentiation resulted in reduced methylation and faster re-expression
of naive-associated genes, thereby accelerating the development of memory cells. 
Longitudinal phenotypic and epigenetic characterization of the memory-precursor
effector subset of virus-specific CD8 T cells transferred into antigen-free mice 
revealed that differentiation to memory cells was coupled to erasure of de novo
methylation programs and re-expression of naive-associated genes. Thus,
epigenetic repression of naive-associated genes in effector CD8 T cells can be
reversed in cells that develop into long-lived memory CD8 T cells while key
effector genes remain demethylated, demonstrating that memory T cells arise from 
a subset of fate-permissive effector T cells.

Blazars are active galactic nuclei, which are powerful sources of radiation whose
central engine is located in the core of the host galaxy. Blazar emission is
dominated by non-thermal radiation from a jet that moves relativistically towards
us, and therefore undergoes Doppler beaming. This beaming causes flux enhancement
and contraction of the variability timescales, so that most blazars appear as
luminous sources characterized by noticeable and fast changes in brightness at
all frequencies. The mechanism that produces this unpredictable variability is
under debate, but proposed mechanisms include injection, acceleration and cooling
of particles, with possible intervention of shock waves or turbulence. Changes in
the viewing angle of the observed emitting knots or jet regions have also been
suggested as an explanation of flaring events and can also explain specific
properties of blazar emission, such as intra-day variability, quasi-periodicity
and the delay of radio flux variations relative to optical changes. Such a
geometric interpretation, however, is not universally accepted because
alternative explanations based on changes in physical conditions-such as the size
and speed of the emitting zone, the magnetic field, the number of emitting
particles and their energy distribution-can explain snapshots of the spectral
behaviour of blazars in many cases. Here we report the results of
optical-to-radio-wavelength monitoring of the blazar CTA 102 and show that the
observed long-term trends of the flux and spectral variability are best explained
by an inhomogeneous, curved jet that undergoes changes in orientation over time. 
We propose that magnetohydrodynamic instabilities or rotation of the twisted jet 
cause different jet regions to change their orientation and hence their relative 
Doppler factors. In particular, the extreme optical outburst of 2016-2017
(brightness increase of six magnitudes) occurred when the corresponding emitting 
region had a small viewing angle. The agreement between observations and
theoretical predictions can be seen as further validation of the relativistic
beaming theory.

Cultivation-independent surveys have shown that the desert soils of Antarctica
harbour surprisingly rich microbial communities. Given that phototroph abundance 
varies across these Antarctic soils, an enduring question is what supports life
in those communities with low photosynthetic capacity. Here we provide evidence
that atmospheric trace gases are the primary energy sources of two Antarctic
surface soil communities. We reconstructed 23 draft genomes from metagenomic
reads, including genomes from the candidate bacterial phyla WPS-2 and AD3. The
dominant community members encoded and expressed high-affinity hydrogenases,
carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, and a RuBisCO lineage known to support
chemosynthetic carbon fixation. Soil microcosms aerobically scavenged atmospheric
H2 and CO at rates sufficient to sustain their theoretical maintenance energy and
mediated substantial levels of chemosynthetic but not photosynthetic CO2
fixation. We propose that atmospheric H2, CO2 and CO provide dependable sources
of energy and carbon to support these communities, which suggests that
atmospheric energy sources can provide an alternative basis for ecosystem
function to solar or geological energy sources. Although more extensive sampling 
is required to verify whether this process is widespread in terrestrial
Antarctica and other oligotrophic habitats, our results provide new understanding
of the minimal nutritional requirements for life and open the possibility that
atmospheric gases support life on other planets.

Maniraptora includes birds and their closest relatives among theropod dinosaurs. 
During the Cretaceous period, several maniraptoran lineages diverged from the
ancestral coelurosaurian bauplan and evolved novel ecomorphologies, including
active flight, gigantism, cursoriality and herbivory. Propagation X-ray
phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography of a well-preserved maniraptoran from 
Mongolia, still partially embedded in the rock matrix, revealed a mosaic of
features, most of them absent among non-avian maniraptorans but shared by
reptilian and avian groups with aquatic or semiaquatic ecologies. This new
theropod, Halszkaraptor escuilliei gen. et sp. nov., is related to other
enigmatic Late Cretaceous maniraptorans from Mongolia in a novel clade at the
root of Dromaeosauridae. This lineage adds an amphibious ecomorphology to those
evolved by maniraptorans: it acquired a predatory mode that relied mainly on neck
hyperelongation for food procurement, it coupled the obligatory bipedalism of
theropods with forelimb proportions that may support a swimming function, and it 
developed postural adaptations convergent with short-tailed birds.

The Great Pyramid, or Khufu's Pyramid, was built on the Giza plateau in Egypt
during the fourth dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu (Cheops), who reigned from 2509 bc
to 2483 bc. Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth, there
is no consensus about how it was built. To understand its internal structure
better, we imaged the pyramid using muons, which are by-products of cosmic rays
that are only partially absorbed by stone. The resulting cosmic-ray muon
radiography allows us to visualize the known and any unknown voids in the pyramid
in a non-invasive way. Here we report the discovery of a large void (with a
cross-section similar to that of the Grand Gallery and a minimum length of
30 metres) situated above the Grand Gallery. This constitutes the first major
inner structure found in the Great Pyramid since the nineteenth century. The
void, named ScanPyramids' Big Void, was first observed with nuclear emulsion
films installed in the Queen's chamber, then confirmed with scintillator
hodoscopes set up in the same chamber and finally re-confirmed with gas detectors
outside the pyramid. This large void has therefore been detected with high
confidence by three different muon detection technologies and three independent
analyses. These results constitute a breakthrough for the understanding of the
internal structure of Khufu's Pyramid. Although there is currently no information
about the intended purpose of this void, these findings show how modern particle 
physics can shed new light on the world's archaeological heritage.

None of the approximately 750,000 known asteroids and comets in the Solar System 
is thought to have originated outside it, despite models of the formation of
planetary systems suggesting that orbital migration of giant planets ejects a
large fraction of the original planetesimals into interstellar space. The high
predicted number density of icy interstellar objects (2.4 × 10-4 per cubic
astronomical unit) suggests that some should have been detected, yet hitherto
none has been seen. Many decades of asteroid and comet characterization have
yielded formation models that explain the mass distribution, chemical abundances 
and planetary configuration of the Solar System today, but there has been no way 
of telling whether the Solar System is typical of planetary systems. Here we
report observations and analysis of the object 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua) that
demonstrate its extrasolar trajectory, and that thus enable comparisons to be
made between material from another planetary system and from our own. Our
observations during the brief visit by the object to the inner Solar System
reveal it to be asteroidal, with no hint of cometary activity despite an approach
within 0.25 astronomical units of the Sun. Spectroscopic measurements show that
the surface of the object is spectrally red, consistent with comets or
organic-rich asteroids that reside within the Solar System. Light-curve
observations indicate that the object has an extremely oblong shape, with a
length about ten times its width, and a mean radius of about 102 metres assuming 
an albedo of 0.04. No known objects in the Solar System have such extreme
dimensions. The presence of 'Oumuamua in the Solar System suggests that previous 
estimates of the number density of interstellar objects, based on the assumption 
that all such objects were cometary, were pessimistically low. Planned upgrades
to contemporary asteroid survey instruments and improved data processing
techniques are likely to result in the detection of more interstellar objects in 
the coming years.

The spreading of pathology within and between brain areas is a hallmark of
neurodegenerative disorders. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, deposition of 
amyloid-β is accompanied by activation of the innate immune system and involves
inflammasome-dependent formation of ASC specks in microglia. ASC specks released 
by microglia bind rapidly to amyloid-β and increase the formation of amyloid-β
oligomers and aggregates, acting as an inflammation-driven cross-seed for
amyloid-β pathology. Here we show that intrahippocampal injection of ASC specks
resulted in spreading of amyloid-β pathology in transgenic double-mutant
APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice. By contrast, homogenates from brains of APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice 
failed to induce seeding and spreading of amyloid-β pathology in ASC-deficient
APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice. Moreover, co-application of an anti-ASC antibody blocked the
increase in amyloid-β pathology in APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice. These findings support
the concept that inflammasome activation is connected to seeding and spreading of
amyloid-β pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Despite active transport into Earth's mantle, water has been present on our
planet's surface for most of geological time. Yet water disappeared from the
Martian surface soon after its formation. Although some of the water on Mars was 
lost to space via photolysis following the collapse of the planet's magnetic
field, the widespread serpentinization of Martian crust suggests that metamorphic
hydration reactions played a critical part in the sequestration of the crust.
Here we quantify the relative volumes of water that could be removed from each
planet's surface via the burial and metamorphism of hydrated mafic crusts, and
calculate mineral transition-induced bulk-density changes at conditions of
elevated pressure and temperature for each. The metamorphic mineral assemblages
in relatively FeO-rich Martian lavas can hold about 25 per cent more structurally
bound water than those in metamorphosed terrestrial basalts, and can retain it at
greater depths within Mars. Our calculations suggest that in excess of 9 per cent
by volume of the Martian mantle may contain hydrous mineral species as a
consequence of surface reactions, compared to about 4 per cent by volume of
Earth's mantle. Furthermore, neither primitive nor evolved hydrated Martian crust
show noticeably different bulk densities compared to their anhydrous equivalents,
in contrast to hydrous mafic terrestrial crust, which transforms to denser
eclogite upon dehydration. This would have allowed efficient overplating and
burial of early Martian crust in a stagnant-lid tectonic regime, in which the
lithosphere comprised a single tectonic plate, with only the warmer, lower crust 
involved in mantle convection. This provided an important sink for hydrospheric
water and a mechanism for oxidizing the Martian mantle. Conversely, relatively
buoyant mafic crust and hotter geothermal gradients on Earth reduced the
potential for upper-mantle hydration early in its geological history, leading to 
water being retained close to its surface, and thus creating conditions conducive
for the evolution of complex multicellular life.

Catalytic cross-metathesis is a central transformation in chemistry, yet
corresponding methods for the stereoselective generation of acyclic
trisubstituted alkenes in either the E or the Z isomeric forms are not known. The
key problems are a lack of chemoselectivity-namely, the preponderance of side
reactions involving only the less hindered starting alkene, resulting in
homo-metathesis by-products-and the formation of short-lived methylidene
complexes. By contrast, in catalytic cross-coupling, substrates are more distinct
and homocoupling is less of a problem. Here we show that through cross-metathesis
reactions involving E- or Z-trisubstituted alkenes, which are easily prepared
from commercially available starting materials by cross-coupling reactions, many 
desirable and otherwise difficult-to-access linear E- or Z-trisubstituted alkenes
can be synthesized efficiently and in exceptional stereoisomeric purity (up to 98
per cent E or 95 per cent Z). The utility of the strategy is demonstrated by the 
concise stereoselective syntheses of biologically active compounds, such as the
antifungal indiacen B and the anti-inflammatory coibacin D.

Erratum in
    Nature. 2017 Dec 13;:.

Wetlands are the largest global source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a potent
greenhouse gas. However, methane emission inventories from the Amazon floodplain,
the largest natural geographic source of CH4 in the tropics, consistently
underestimate the atmospheric burden of CH4 determined via remote sensing and
inversion modelling, pointing to a major gap in our understanding of the
contribution of these ecosystems to CH4 emissions. Here we report CH4 fluxes from
the stems of 2,357 individual Amazonian floodplain trees from 13 locations across
the central Amazon basin. We find that escape of soil gas through wetland trees
is the dominant source of regional CH4 emissions. Methane fluxes from Amazon tree
stems were up to 200 times larger than emissions reported for temperate wet
forests and tropical peat swamp forests, representing the largest non-ebullitive 
wetland fluxes observed. Emissions from trees had an average stable carbon
isotope value (δ13C) of -66.2 ± 6.4 per mil, consistent with a soil biogenic
origin. We estimate that floodplain trees emit 15.1 ± 1.8 to 21.2 ± 2.5 teragrams
of CH4 a year, in addition to the 20.5 ± 5.3 teragrams a year emitted regionally 
from other sources. Furthermore, we provide a 'top-down' regional estimate of CH4
emissions of 42.7 ± 5.6 teragrams of CH4 a year for the Amazon basin, based on
regular vertical lower-troposphere CH4 profiles covering the period 2010-2013. We
find close agreement between our 'top-down' and combined 'bottom-up' estimates,
indicating that large CH4 emissions from trees adapted to permanent or seasonal
inundation can account for the emission source that is required to close the
Amazon CH4 budget. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tree stem surfaces 
in mediating approximately half of all wetland CH4 emissions in the Amazon
floodplain, a region that represents up to one-third of the global wetland CH4
source when trees are combined with other emission sources.

Ca2+-activated, non-selective (CAN) ion channels sense increases of the
intracellular Ca2+ concentration, producing a flux of Na+ and/or K+ ions that
depolarizes the cell, thus modulating cellular Ca2+ entry. CAN channels are
involved in cellular responses such as neuronal bursting activity and cardiac
rhythm. Here we report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of the most
widespread CAN channel, human TRPM4, bound to the agonist Ca2+ and the modulator 
decavanadate. Four cytosolic C-terminal domains form an umbrella-like structure
with a coiled-coil domain for the 'pole' and four helical 'ribs' spanning the
N-terminal TRPM homology regions (MHRs), thus holding four subunits in a
crown-like architecture. We observed two decavanadate-binding sites, one in the
C-terminal domain and another in the intersubunit MHR interface. A glutamine in
the selectivity filter may be an important determinant of monovalent selectivity.
Our structure provides new insights into the function and pharmacology of both
the CAN and the TRPM families.

Alzheimer's disease is a common and devastating disease characterized by
aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide. However, we know relatively little about
the underlying molecular mechanisms or how to treat patients with Alzheimer's
disease. Here we provide bioinformatic and experimental evidence of a conserved
mitochondrial stress response signature present in diseases involving amyloid-β
proteotoxicity in human, mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans that involves the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitophagy pathways. Using a worm
model of amyloid-β proteotoxicity, GMC101, we recapitulated mitochondrial
features and confirmed that the induction of this mitochondrial stress response
was essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis and health.
Notably, increasing mitochondrial proteostasis by pharmacologically and
genetically targeting mitochondrial translation and mitophagy increases the
fitness and lifespan of GMC101 worms and reduces amyloid aggregation in cells,
worms and in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Our data support the
relevance of enhancing mitochondrial proteostasis to delay amyloid-β proteotoxic 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness in adults, and is
characterized by progressive loss of vascular cells and slow dissolution of
inter-vascular junctions, which result in vascular leakage and retinal oedema.
Later stages of the disease are characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, 
tissue destruction and neovascularization. Here we identify soluble epoxide
hydrolase (sEH) as a key enzyme that initiates pericyte loss and breakdown of
endothelial barrier function by generating the diol
19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid, derived from docosahexaenoic acid. The
expression of sEH and the accumulation of 19,20-dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid
were increased in diabetic mouse retinas and in the retinas and vitreous humour
of patients with diabetes. Mechanistically, the diol targeted the cell membrane
to alter the localization of cholesterol-binding proteins, and prevented the
association of presenilin 1 with N-cadherin and VE-cadherin, thereby compromising
pericyte-endothelial cell interactions and inter-endothelial cell junctions.
Treating diabetic mice with a specific sEH inhibitor prevented the pericyte loss 
and vascular permeability that are characteristic of non-proliferative diabetic
retinopathy. Conversely, overexpression of sEH in the retinal Müller glial cells 
of non-diabetic mice resulted in similar vessel abnormalities to those seen in
diabetic mice with retinopathy. Thus, increased expression of sEH is a key
determinant in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, and inhibition of sEH
can prevent progression of the disease.

Transposable elements can drive genome evolution, but their enhanced activity is 
detrimental to the host and therefore must be tightly regulated. The
Piwi-interacting small RNA (piRNA) pathway is vital for the regulation of
transposable elements, by inducing transcriptional silencing or
post-transcriptional decay of mRNAs. Here we show that piRNAs and piRNA
biogenesis components regulate precursor mRNA splicing of P-transposable element 
transcripts in vivo, leading to the production of the non-transposase-encoding
mature mRNA isoform in Drosophila germ cells. Unexpectedly, we show that the
piRNA pathway components do not act to reduce transcript levels of the P-element 
transposon during P-M hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome that affects germline
development in Drosophila. Instead, splicing regulation is mechanistically
achieved together with piRNA-mediated changes to repressive chromatin states, and
relies on the function of the Piwi-piRNA complex proteins Asterix (also known as 
Gtsf1) and Panoramix (Silencio), as well as Heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a;
encoded by Su(var)205). Furthermore, we show that this machinery, together with
the piRNA Flamenco cluster, not only controls the accumulation of Gypsy
retrotransposon transcripts but also regulates the splicing of Gypsy mRNAs in
cultured ovarian somatic cells, a process required for the production of
infectious particles that can lead to heritable transposition events. Our
findings identify splicing regulation as a new role and essential function for
the Piwi pathway in protecting the genome against transposon mobility, and
provide a model system for studying the role of chromatin structure in modulating
alternative splicing during development.

Cells can sense the density and distribution of extracellular matrix (ECM)
molecules by means of individual integrin proteins and larger,
integrin-containing adhesion complexes within the cell membrane. This spatial
sensing drives cellular activity in a variety of normal and pathological
contexts. Previous studies of cells on rigid glass surfaces have shown that
spatial sensing of ECM ligands takes place at the nanometre scale, with integrin 
clustering and subsequent formation of focal adhesions impaired when single
integrin-ligand bonds are separated by more than a few tens of nanometres. It has
thus been suggested that a crosslinking 'adaptor' protein of this size might
connect integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, acting as a molecular ruler that
senses ligand spacing directly. Here, we develop gels whose rigidity and
nanometre-scale distribution of ECM ligands can be controlled and altered. We
find that increasing the spacing between ligands promotes the growth of focal
adhesions on low-rigidity substrates, but leads to adhesion collapse on
more-rigid substrates. Furthermore, disordering the ligand distribution
drastically increases adhesion growth, but reduces the rigidity threshold for
adhesion collapse. The growth and collapse of focal adhesions are mirrored by,
respectively, the nuclear or cytosolic localization of the transcriptional
regulator protein YAP. We explain these findings not through direct sensing of
ligand spacing, but by using an expanded computational molecular-clutch model, in
which individual integrin-ECM bonds-the molecular clutches-respond to force
loading by recruiting extra integrins, up to a maximum value. This generates more
clutches, redistributing the overall force among them, and reducing the force
loading per clutch. At high rigidity and high ligand spacing, maximum recruitment
is reached, preventing further force redistribution and leading to adhesion
collapse. Measurements of cellular traction forces and actin flow speeds support 
our model. Our results provide a general framework for how cells sense spatial
and physical information at the nanoscale, precisely tuning the range of
conditions at which they form adhesions and activate transcriptional regulation.

Cancer incidence is rising and this global challenge is further exacerbated by
tumour resistance to available medicines. A promising approach to meet the need
for improved cancer treatment is drug repurposing. Here we highlight the
potential for repurposing disulfiram (also known by the trade name Antabuse), an 
old alcohol-aversion drug that has been shown to be effective against diverse
cancer types in preclinical studies. Our nationwide epidemiological study reveals
that patients who continuously used disulfiram have a lower risk of death from
cancer compared to those who stopped using the drug at their diagnosis. Moreover,
we identify the ditiocarb-copper complex as the metabolite of disulfiram that is 
responsible for its anti-cancer effects, and provide methods to detect
preferential accumulation of the complex in tumours and candidate biomarkers to
analyse its effect on cells and tissues. Finally, our functional and biophysical 
analyses reveal the molecular target of disulfiram's tumour-suppressing effects
as NPL4, an adaptor of p97 (also known as VCP) segregase, which is essential for 
the turnover of proteins involved in multiple regulatory and stress-response
pathways in cells.

TRPM4 is a calcium-activated, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
(PtdIns(4,5)P2) -modulated, non-selective cation channel that belongs to the
family of melastatin-related transient receptor potential (TRPM) channels. Here
we present the electron cryo-microscopy structures of the mouse TRPM4 channel
with and without ATP. TRPM4 consists of multiple transmembrane and cytosolic
domains, which assemble into a three-tiered architecture. The N-terminal
nucleotide-binding domain and the C-terminal coiled-coil participate in the
tetrameric assembly of the channel; ATP binds at the nucleotide-binding domain
and inhibits channel activity. TRPM4 has an exceptionally wide filter but is only
permeable to monovalent cations; filter residue Gln973 is essential in defining
monovalent selectivity. The S1-S4 domain and the post-S6 TRP domain form the
central gating apparatus that probably houses the Ca2+- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding
sites. These structures provide an essential starting point for elucidating the
complex gating mechanisms of TRPM4 and reveal the molecular architecture of the
TRPM family.

Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells are found at common sites of pathogen
exposure, where they elicit rapid and robust protective immune responses.
However, the molecular signals that control TRM cell differentiation and
homeostasis are not fully understood. Here we show that mouse TRM precursor cells
represent a unique CD8+ T cell subset that is distinct from the precursors of
circulating memory cell populations at the levels of gene expression and
chromatin accessibility. Using computational and pooled in vivo RNA interference 
screens, we identify the transcription factor Runx3 as a key regulator of TRM
cell differentiation and homeostasis. Runx3 was required to establish TRM cell
populations in diverse tissue environments, and supported the expression of
crucial tissue-residency genes while suppressing genes associated with tissue
egress and recirculation. Furthermore, we show that human and mouse
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes share a core tissue-residency gene-expression
signature with TRM cells that is associated with Runx3 activity. In a mouse model
of adoptive T cell therapy for melanoma, Runx3-deficient CD8+ tumour-infiltrating
lymphocytes failed to accumulate in tumours, resulting in greater rates of tumour
growth and mortality. Conversely, overexpression of Runx3 enhanced
tumour-specific CD8+ T cell abundance, delayed tumour growth, and prolonged
survival. In addition to establishing Runx3 as a central regulator of TRM cell
differentiation, these results provide insight into the signals that promote T
cell residency in non-lymphoid sites, which could be used to enhance vaccine
efficacy or adoptive cell therapy treatments that target cancer.

Histone modifications, such as the frequently occurring lysine succinylation, are
central to the regulation of chromatin-based processes. However, the mechanism
and functional consequences of histone succinylation are unknown. Here we show
that the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) complex is localized in the
nucleus in human cell lines and binds to lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A, also
known as GCN5) in the promoter regions of genes. We show that succinyl-coenzyme A
(succinyl-CoA) binds to KAT2A. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of
KAT2A in complex with succinyl-CoA at 2.3 Å resolution shows that succinyl-CoA
binds to a deep cleft of KAT2A with the succinyl moiety pointing towards the end 
of a flexible loop 3, which adopts different structural conformations in
succinyl-CoA-bound and acetyl-CoA-bound forms. Site-directed mutagenesis
indicates that tyrosine 645 in this loop has an important role in the selective
binding of succinyl-CoA over acetyl-CoA. KAT2A acts as a succinyltransferase and 
succinylates histone H3 on lysine 79, with a maximum frequency around the
transcription start sites of genes. Preventing the α-KGDH complex from entering
the nucleus, or expression of KAT2A(Tyr645Ala), reduces gene expression and
inhibits tumour cell proliferation and tumour growth. These findings reveal an
important mechanism of histone modification and demonstrate that local generation
of succinyl-CoA by the nuclear α-KGDH complex coupled with the
succinyltransferase activity of KAT2A is instrumental in histone succinylation,
tumour cell proliferation, and tumour development.

    Cell Host Microbe. 2018 Jan 10;23 (1):1-3.

Microbiome-wide association studies have established that numerous diseases are
associated with changes in the microbiota. These studies typically generate a
long list of commensals implicated as biomarkers of disease, with no clear
relevance to disease pathogenesis. If the field is to move beyond correlations
and begin to address causation, an effective system is needed for refining this
catalogue of differentially abundant microbes and to allow subsequent mechanistic
studies. Here we demonstrate that triangulation of microbe-phenotype
relationships is an effective method for reducing the noise inherent in
microbiota studies and enabling identification of causal microbes. We found that 
gnotobiotic mice harbouring different microbial communities exhibited
differential survival in a colitis model. Co-housing of these mice generated
animals that had hybrid microbiotas and displayed intermediate susceptibility to 
colitis. Mapping of microbe-phenotype relationships in parental mouse strains and
in mice with hybrid microbiotas identified the bacterial family Lachnospiraceae
as a correlate for protection from disease. Using directed microbial culture
techniques, we discovered Clostridium immunis, a previously unknown bacterial
species from this family, that-when administered to colitis-prone mice-protected 
them against colitis-associated death. To demonstrate the generalizability of our
approach, we used it to identify several commensal organisms that induce
intestinal expression of an antimicrobial peptide. Thus, we have used
microbe-phenotype triangulation to move beyond the standard correlative
microbiome study and identify causal microbes for two completely distinct
phenotypes. Identification of disease-modulating commensals by microbe-phenotype 
triangulation may be more broadly applicable to human microbiome studies.

The foundations of mammalian development lie in a cluster of embryonic epiblast
stem cells. In response to extracellular matrix signalling, these cells undergo
epithelialization and create an apical surface in contact with a cavity, a
fundamental event for all subsequent development. Concomitantly, epiblast cells
transit through distinct pluripotent states, before lineage commitment at
gastrulation. These pluripotent states have been characterized at the molecular
level, but their biological importance remains unclear. Here we show that exit
from an unrestricted naive pluripotent state is required for epiblast
epithelialization and generation of the pro-amniotic cavity in mouse embryos.
Embryonic stem cells locked in the naive state are able to initiate polarization 
but fail to undergo lumenogenesis. Mechanistically, exit from naive pluripotency 
activates an Oct4-governed transcriptional program that results in expression of 
glycosylated sialomucin proteins and the vesicle tethering and fusion events of
lumenogenesis. Similarly, exit of epiblasts from naive pluripotency in cultured
human post-implantation embryos triggers amniotic cavity formation and
developmental progression. Our results add tissue-level architecture as a new
criterion for the characterization of different pluripotent states, and show the 
relevance of transitions between these states during development of the mammalian
embryo.

Three distinct RNA polymerases transcribe different classes of genes in the
eukaryotic nucleus. RNA polymerase (Pol) III is the essential, evolutionarily
conserved enzyme that generates short, non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs and 5S
rRNA. The historical focus on transcription of protein-coding genes has left the 
roles of Pol III in organismal physiology relatively unexplored. Target of
rapamycin kinase complex 1 (TORC1) regulates Pol III activity, and is also an
important determinant of longevity. This raises the possibility that Pol III is
involved in ageing. Here we show that Pol III limits lifespan downstream of
TORC1. We find that a reduction in Pol III extends chronological lifespan in
yeast and organismal lifespan in worms and flies. Inhibiting the activity of Pol 
III in the gut of adult worms or flies is sufficient to extend lifespan; in
flies, longevity can be achieved by Pol III inhibition specifically in intestinal
stem cells. The longevity phenotype is associated with amelioration of
age-related gut pathology and functional decline, dampened protein synthesis and 
increased tolerance of proteostatic stress. Pol III acts on lifespan downstream
of TORC1, and limiting Pol III activity in the adult gut achieves the full
longevity benefit of systemic TORC1 inhibition. Hence, Pol III is a pivotal
mediator of this key nutrient-signalling network for longevity; the
growth-promoting anabolic activity of Pol III mediates the acceleration of ageing
by TORC1. The evolutionary conservation of Pol III affirms its potential as a
therapeutic target.

The vascular barrier that separates blood from tissues is actively regulated by
the endothelium and is essential for transport, inflammation, and haemostasis.
Haemodynamic shear stress plays a critical role in maintaining endothelial
barrier function, but how this occurs remains unknown. Here we use an engineered 
organotypic model of perfused microvessels to show that activation of the
transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 directly regulates vascular barrier function
through a non-canonical, transcription-independent signalling mechanism that
drives assembly of adherens junctions, and confirm these findings in mouse
models. Shear stress triggers DLL4-dependent proteolytic activation of NOTCH1 to 
expose the transmembrane domain of NOTCH1. This domain mediates establishment of 
the endothelial barrier; expression of the transmembrane domain of NOTCH1 is
sufficient to rescue defects in barrier function induced by knockout of NOTCH1.
The transmembrane domain restores barrier function by catalysing the formation of
a receptor complex in the plasma membrane consisting of vascular endothelial
cadherin, the transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase LAR, and the RAC1
guanidine-exchange factor TRIO. This complex activates RAC1 to drive assembly of 
adherens junctions and establish barrier function. Canonical transcriptional
signalling via Notch is highly conserved in metazoans and is required for many
processes in vascular development, including arterial-venous differentiation,
angiogenesis and remodelling. We establish the existence of a non-canonical
cortical NOTCH1 signalling pathway that regulates vascular barrier function, and 
thus provide a mechanism by which a single receptor might link transcriptional
programs with adhesive and cytoskeletal remodelling.

White dwarfs are often found in binary systems with orbital periods ranging from 
tens of minutes to hours in which they can accrete gas from their companion
stars. In about 15 per cent of these binaries, the magnetic field of the white
dwarf is strong enough (at 106 gauss or more) to channel the accreted matter
along field lines onto the magnetic poles. The remaining systems are referred to 
as 'non-magnetic', because until now there has been no evidence that they have a 
magnetic field that is strong enough to affect the accretion dynamics. Here we
report an analysis of archival optical observations of the 'non-magnetic'
accreting white dwarf in the binary system MV Lyrae, whose light curve displays
quasi-periodic bursts of about 30 minutes duration roughly every 2 hours. The
timescale and amplitude of these bursts indicate the presence of an unstable,
magnetically regulated accretion mode, which in turn implies the existence of
magnetically gated accretion, in which disk material builds up around the
magnetospheric boundary (at the co-rotation radius) and then accretes onto the
white dwarf, producing bursts powered by the release of gravitational potential
energy. We infer a surface magnetic field strength for the white dwarf in MV
Lyrae of between 2 × 104 gauss and 1 × 105 gauss, too low to be detectable by
other current methods. Our discovery provides a new way of studying the strength 
and evolution of magnetic fields in accreting white dwarfs and extends the
connections between accretion onto white dwarfs, young stellar objects and
neutron stars, for which similar magnetically gated accretion cycles have been
identified.

Progress towards the integration of technology into living organisms requires
electrical power sources that are biocompatible, mechanically flexible, and able 
to harness the chemical energy available inside biological systems. Conventional 
batteries were not designed with these criteria in mind. The electric organ of
the knifefish Electrophorus electricus (commonly known as the electric eel) is,
however, an example of an electrical power source that operates within biological
constraints while featuring power characteristics that include peak potential
differences of 600 volts and currents of 1 ampere. Here we introduce an
electric-eel-inspired power concept that uses gradients of ions between miniature
polyacrylamide hydrogel compartments bounded by a repeating sequence of cation-
and anion-selective hydrogel membranes. The system uses a scalable stacking or
folding geometry that generates 110 volts at open circuit or 27 milliwatts per
square metre per gel cell upon simultaneous, self-registered mechanical contact
activation of thousands of gel compartments in series while circumventing power
dissipation before contact. Unlike typical batteries, these systems are soft,
flexible, transparent, and potentially biocompatible. These characteristics
suggest that artificial electric organs could be used to power next-generation
implant materials such as pacemakers, implantable sensors, or prosthetic devices 
in hybrids of living and non-living systems.

Antarctica's continental-scale ice sheets have evolved over the past 50 million
years. However, the dearth of ice-proximal geological records limits our
understanding of past East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) behaviour and thus our
ability to evaluate its response to ongoing environmental change. The EAIS is
marine-terminating and grounded below sea level within the Aurora subglacial
basin, indicating that this catchment, which drains ice to the Sabrina Coast, may
be sensitive to climate perturbations. Here we show, using marine geological and 
geophysical data from the continental shelf seaward of the Aurora subglacial
basin, that marine-terminating glaciers existed at the Sabrina Coast by the early
to middle Eocene epoch. This finding implies the existence of substantial ice
volume in the Aurora subglacial basin before continental-scale ice sheets were
established about 34 million years ago. Subsequently, ice advanced across and
retreated from the Sabrina Coast continental shelf at least 11 times during the
Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Tunnel valleys associated with half of these
glaciations indicate that a surface-meltwater-rich sub-polar glacial system
existed under climate conditions similar to those anticipated with continued
anthropogenic warming. Cooling since the late Miocene resulted in an expanded
polar EAIS and a limited glacial response to Pliocene warmth in the Aurora
subglacial basin catchment. Geological records from the Sabrina Coast shelf
indicate that, in addition to ocean temperature, atmospheric temperature and
surface-derived meltwater influenced East Antarctic ice mass balance under
warmer-than-present climate conditions. Our results imply a dynamic EAIS response
with continued anthropogenic warming and suggest that the EAIS contribution to
future global sea-level projections may be under-estimated.

The most viscous volcanic melts and the largest explosive eruptions on our planet
consist of calcalkaline rhyolites. These eruptions have the potential to
influence global climate. The eruptive products are commonly very crystal-poor
and highly degassed, yet the magma is mostly stored as crystal mushes containing 
small amounts of interstitial melt with elevated water content. It is unclear how
magma mushes are mobilized to create large batches of eruptible crystal-free
magma. Further, rhyolitic eruptions can switch repeatedly between effusive and
explosive eruption styles and this transition is difficult to attribute to the
rheological effects of water content or crystallinity. Here we measure the
viscosity of a series of melts spanning the compositional range of the
Yellowstone volcanic system and find that in a narrow compositional zone, melt
viscosity increases by up to two orders of magnitude. These viscosity variations 
are not predicted by current viscosity models and result from melt structure
reorganization, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. We identify a critical
compositional tipping point, independently documented in the global geochemical
record of rhyolites, at which rhyolitic melts fluidize or stiffen and that
clearly separates effusive from explosive deposits worldwide. This correlation
between melt structure, viscosity and eruptive behaviour holds despite the
variable water content and other parameters, such as temperature, that are
inherent in natural eruptions. Thermodynamic modelling demonstrates how the
observed subtle compositional changes that result in fluidization or stiffening
of the melt can be induced by crystal growth from the melt or variation in oxygen
fugacity. However, the rheological effects of water and crystal content alone
cannot explain the correlation between composition and eruptive style. We
conclude that the composition of calcalkaline rhyolites is decisive in
determining the mobilization and eruption dynamics of Earth's largest volcanic
systems, resulting in a better understanding of how the melt structure controls
volcanic processes.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification in both coding 
and non-coding RNAs that is catalysed by the METTL3-METTL14 methyltransferase
complex. However, the specific role of these enzymes in cancer is still largely
unknown. Here we define a pathway that is specific for METTL3 and is implicated
in the maintenance of a leukaemic state. We identify METTL3 as an essential gene 
for growth of acute myeloid leukaemia cells in two distinct genetic screens.
Downregulation of METTL3 results in cell cycle arrest, differentiation of
leukaemic cells and failure to establish leukaemia in immunodeficient mice. We
show that METTL3, independently of METTL14, associates with chromatin and
localizes to the transcriptional start sites of active genes. The vast majority
of these genes have the CAATT-box binding protein CEBPZ present at the
transcriptional start site, and this is required for recruitment of METTL3 to
chromatin. Promoter-bound METTL3 induces m6A modification within the coding
region of the associated mRNA transcript, and enhances its translation by
relieving ribosome stalling. We show that genes regulated by METTL3 in this way
are necessary for acute myeloid leukaemia. Together, these data define METTL3 as 
a regulator of a chromatin-based pathway that is necessary for maintenance of the
leukaemic state and identify this enzyme as a potential therapeutic target for
acute myeloid leukaemia.

In the fossil record, taxa exhibit a regular pattern of waxing and waning of
occupancy, range or diversity between their origin and extinction. This pattern
appears to contradict the law of constant extinction, which states that the
probability of extinction in a given taxon is independent of that taxon's age. It
is nevertheless well established for species, genera and higher taxa of
terrestrial mammals, marine invertebrates, marine microorganisms, and recent
Hawaiian clades of animals and plants. Here we show that the apparent
contradiction between a stochastically constant extinction rate and the seemingly
deterministic waxing and waning pattern of taxa disappears when we consider their
peak of expansion rather than their final extinction. To a first approximation,
we find that biotic drivers of evolution pertain mainly to the peak of taxon
expansion, whereas abiotic drivers mainly apply to taxon extinction. The Red
Queen's hypothesis, which emphasizes biotic interactions, was originally proposed
as an explanation of the law of constant extinction. Much effort has since been
devoted to determining how this hypothesis, emphasizing competition for
resources, relates to the effects of environmental change. One proposed
resolution is that biotic and abiotic processes operate at different scales. By
focusing attention on taxon expansion rather than survival, we resolve an
apparent contradiction between the seemingly deterministic waxing and waning
patterns over time and the randomness of extinction that the Red Queen's
hypothesis implies.

Recent advances in enzyme engineering and design have expanded nature's catalytic
repertoire to functions that are new to biology. However, only a subset of these 
engineered enzymes can function in living systems. Finding enzymatic pathways
that form chemical bonds that are not found in biology is particularly difficult 
in the cellular environment, as this depends on the discovery not only of new
enzyme activities, but also of reagents that are both sufficiently reactive for
the desired transformation and stable in vivo. Here we report the discovery,
evolution and generalization of a fully genetically encoded platform for
producing chiral organoboranes in bacteria. Escherichia coli cells harbouring
wild-type cytochrome c from Rhodothermus marinus (Rma cyt c) were found to form
carbon-boron bonds in the presence of borane-Lewis base complexes, through
carbene insertion into boron-hydrogen bonds. Directed evolution of Rma cyt c in
the bacterial catalyst provided access to 16 novel chiral organoboranes. The
catalyst is suitable for gram-scale biosynthesis, providing up to 15,300
turnovers, a turnover frequency of 6,100 h-1, a 99:1 enantiomeric ratio and 100% 
chemoselectivity. The enantiopreference of the biocatalyst could also be tuned to
provide either enantiomer of the organoborane products. Evolved in the context of
whole-cell catalysts, the proteins were more active in the whole-cell system than
in purified forms. This study establishes a DNA-encoded and readily engineered
bacterial platform for borylation; engineering can be accomplished at a pace that
rivals the development of chemical synthetic methods, with the ability to achieve
turnovers that are two orders of magnitude (over 400-fold) greater than those of 
known chiral catalysts for the same class of transformation. This tunable method 
for manipulating boron in cells could expand the scope of boron chemistry in
living systems.

Genetically identical individuals that grow in the same environment often show
substantial phenotypic variation within populations of organisms as diverse as
bacteria, nematodes, rodents and humans. With some exceptions, the causes are
poorly understood. Here we show that isogenic Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes
vary in their size at hatching, speed of development, growth rate, starvation
resistance, fecundity, and also in the rate of development of their germline
relative to that of somatic tissues. We show that the primary cause of this
variation is the age of an individual's mother, with the progeny of young mothers
exhibiting several phenotypic impairments. We identify age-dependent changes in
the maternal provisioning of the lipoprotein complex vitellogenin to embryos as
the molecular mechanism that underlies the variation in multiple traits
throughout the life of an animal. The production of sub-optimal progeny by young 
mothers may reflect a trade-off between the competing fitness traits of a short
generation time and the survival and fecundity of the progeny.

Malaria is among the most serious infectious diseases affecting humans,
accounting for approximately half a million deaths each year. Plasmodium
falciparum causes most life-threatening cases of malaria. Acquired immunity to
malaria is inefficient, even after repeated exposure to P. falciparum, but the
immune regulatory mechanisms used by P. falciparum remain largely unknown. Here
we show that P. falciparum uses immune inhibitory receptors to achieve immune
evasion. RIFIN proteins are products of a polymorphic multigene family comprising
approximately 150-200 genes per parasite genome that are expressed on the surface
of infected erythrocytes. We found that a subset of RIFINs binds to either
leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) or leucocyte-associated
immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1). LILRB1-binding RIFINs inhibit activation 
of LILRB1-expressing B cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, P.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes isolated from patients with severe malaria were 
more likely to interact with LILRB1 than erythrocytes from patients with
non-severe malaria, although an extended study with larger sample sizes is
required to confirm this finding. Our results suggest that P. falciparum has
acquired multiple RIFINs to evade the host immune system by targeting immune
inhibitory receptors.

Transfer-RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs; also called tRNA-derived fragments) are 
an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs whose biological roles are not well
understood. Here we show that inhibition of a specific tsRNA, LeuCAG3'tsRNA,
induces apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells in vitro and in a patient-derived
orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma model in mice. This tsRNA binds at least two 
ribosomal protein mRNAs (RPS28 and RPS15) to enhance their translation. A
decrease in translation of RPS28 mRNA blocks pre-18S ribosomal RNA processing,
resulting in a reduction in the number of 40S ribosomal subunits. These data
establish a post-transcriptional mechanism that can fine-tune gene expression
during different physiological states and provide a potential new target for
treating cancer.

Molecular alterations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) promote
cancer initiation and foster tumour progression. Cancers deficient in MMR
frequently show favourable prognosis and indolent progression. The functional
basis of the clinical outcome of patients with tumours that are deficient in MMR 
is not clear. Here we genetically inactivate MutL homologue 1 (MLH1) in
colorectal, breast and pancreatic mouse cancer cells. The growth of MMR-deficient
cells was comparable to their proficient counterparts in vitro and on
transplantation in immunocompromised mice. By contrast, MMR-deficient cancer
cells grew poorly when transplanted in syngeneic mice. The inactivation of MMR
increased the mutational burden and led to dynamic mutational profiles, which
resulted in the persistent renewal of neoantigens in vitro and in vivo, whereas
MMR-proficient cells exhibited stable mutational load and neoantigen profiles
over time. Immune surveillance improved when cancer cells, in which MLH1 had been
inactivated, accumulated neoantigens for several generations. When restricted to 
a clonal population, the dynamic generation of neoantigens driven by MMR further 
increased immune surveillance. Inactivation of MMR, driven by acquired resistance
to the clinical agent temozolomide, increased mutational load, promoted
continuous renewal of neoantigens in human colorectal cancers and triggered
immune surveillance in mouse models. These results suggest that targeting DNA
repair processes can increase the burden of neoantigens in tumour cells; this has
the potential to be exploited in therapeutic approaches.

The sustainability of malaria control in Africa is threatened by the rise of
insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit the disease. To
gain a deeper understanding of how mosquito populations are evolving, here we
sequenced the genomes of 765 specimens of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles
coluzzii sampled from 15 locations across Africa, and identified over 50 million 
single nucleotide polymorphisms within the accessible genome. These data revealed
complex population structure and patterns of gene flow, with evidence of ancient 
expansions, recent bottlenecks, and local variation in effective population size.
Strong signals of recent selection were observed in insecticide-resistance genes,
with several sweeps spreading over large geographical distances and between
species. The design of new tools for mosquito control using gene-drive systems
will need to take account of high levels of genetic diversity in natural mosquito
populations.

High-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CREs), which lose energy quickly 
during their propagation, provide a probe of Galactic high-energy processes and
may enable the observation of phenomena such as dark-matter particle annihilation
or decay. The CRE spectrum has been measured directly up to approximately 2
teraelectronvolts in previous balloon- or space-borne experiments, and indirectly
up to approximately 5 teraelectronvolts using ground-based Cherenkov γ-ray
telescope arrays. Evidence for a spectral break in the teraelectronvolt energy
range has been provided by indirect measurements, although the results were
qualified by sizeable systematic uncertainties. Here we report a direct
measurement of CREs in the energy range 25 gigaelectronvolts to 4.6
teraelectronvolts by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) with
unprecedentedly high energy resolution and low background. The largest part of
the spectrum can be well fitted by a 'smoothly broken power-law' model rather
than a single power-law model. The direct detection of a spectral break at about 
0.9 teraelectronvolts confirms the evidence found by previous indirect
measurements, clarifies the behaviour of the CRE spectrum at energies above 1
teraelectronvolt and sheds light on the physical origin of the
sub-teraelectronvolt CREs.

Autosomal-recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP) is caused by mutations in a
number of PARK genes, in particular the genes encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase
Parkin (PARK2, also known as PRKN) and its upstream protein kinase PINK1 (also
known as PARK6). PINK1 phosphorylates both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like
domain of Parkin on structurally protected Ser65 residues, triggering mitophagy. 
Here we report a crystal structure of a nanobody-stabilized complex containing
Pediculus humanus corporis (Ph)PINK1 bound to ubiquitin in the 'C-terminally
retracted' (Ub-CR) conformation. The structure reveals many peculiarities of
PINK1, including the architecture of the C-terminal region, and reveals how the N
lobe of PINK1 binds ubiquitin via a unique insertion. The flexible Ser65 loop in 
the Ub-CR conformation contacts the activation segment, facilitating placement of
Ser65 in a phosphate-accepting position. The structure also explains how
autophosphorylation in the N lobe stabilizes structurally and functionally
important insertions, and reveals the molecular basis of AR-JP-causing mutations,
some of which disrupt ubiquitin binding.

Fibrosis is a common pathology in cardiovascular disease. In the heart, fibrosis 
causes mechanical and electrical dysfunction and in the kidney, it predicts the
onset of renal failure. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) is the principal
pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to
its pleiotropic roles. We hypothesized that downstream effectors of TGFβ1 in
fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity.
Here we show, using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human
fibroblasts, that upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) is the dominant
transcriptional response to TGFβ1 exposure and required for its pro-fibrotic
effect. IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in
fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine
signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice,
fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il-11 injection causes heart and
kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 protects
against disease. Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation
across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic
stimuli. These results reveal a central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose 
that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic
diseases.

T cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of highly aggressive
malignancies with poor clinical outcomes. T cell lymphomas originate from
peripheral T cells and are frequently characterized by genetic gain-of-function
variants in T cell receptor (TCR) signalling molecules. Although these oncogenic 
alterations are thought to drive TCR pathways to induce chronic proliferation and
cell survival programmes, it remains unclear whether T cells contain tumour
suppressors that can counteract these events. Here we show that the acute
enforcement of oncogenic TCR signalling in lymphocytes in a mouse model of human 
T cell lymphoma drives the strong expansion of these cells in vivo. However, this
response is short-lived and robustly counteracted by cell-intrinsic mechanisms. A
subsequent genome-wide in vivo screen using T cell-specific transposon
mutagenesis identified PDCD1, which encodes the inhibitory receptor programmed
death-1 (PD-1), as a master gene that suppresses oncogenic T cell signalling.
Mono- and bi-allelic deletions of PDCD1 are also recurrently observed in human T 
cell lymphomas with frequencies that can exceed 30%, indicating high clinical
relevance. Mechanistically, the activity of PD-1 enhances levels of the tumour
suppressor PTEN and attenuates signalling by the kinases AKT and PKC in
pre-malignant cells. By contrast, a homo- or heterozygous deletion of PD-1 allows
unrestricted T cell growth after an oncogenic insult and leads to the rapid
development of highly aggressive lymphomas in vivo that are readily
transplantable to recipients. Thus, the inhibitory PD-1 receptor is a potent
haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in T cell lymphomas that is frequently
altered in human disease. These findings extend the known physiological functions
of PD-1 beyond the prevention of immunopathology after antigen-induced T cell
activation, and have implications for T cell lymphoma therapies and for current
strategies that target PD-1 in the broader context of immuno-oncology.

Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are widely used to construct nanometre-scale
structures with ever increasing complexity, with possible application in fields
such as structural biology, biophysics, synthetic biology and photonics. The
nanostructures are formed through one-pot self-assembly, with early
kilodalton-scale examples containing typically tens of unique DNA strands. The
introduction of DNA origami, which uses many staple strands to fold one long
scaffold strand into a desired structure, has provided access to megadalton-scale
nanostructures that contain hundreds of unique DNA strands. Even larger DNA
origami structures are possible, but manufacturing and manipulating an
increasingly long scaffold strand remains a challenge. An alternative and more
readily scalable approach involves the assembly of DNA bricks, which each consist
of four short binding domains arranged so that the bricks can interlock. This
approach does not require a scaffold; instead, the short DNA brick strands
self-assemble according to specific inter-brick interactions. First-generation
bricks used to create three-dimensional structures are 32 nucleotides long,
consisting of four eight-nucleotide binding domains. Protocols have been designed
to direct the assembly of hundreds of distinct bricks into well formed
structures, but attempts to create larger structures have encountered practical
challenges and had limited success. Here we show that DNA bricks with longer,
13-nucleotide binding domains make it possible to self-assemble 0.1-1-gigadalton,
three-dimensional nanostructures from tens of thousands of unique components,
including a 0.5-gigadalton cuboid containing about 30,000 unique bricks and a
1-gigadalton rotationally symmetric tetramer. We also assembled a cuboid that
contains around 10,000 bricks and about 20,000 uniquely addressable, 13-base-pair
'voxels' that serves as a molecular canvas for three-dimensional sculpting.
Complex, user-prescribed, three-dimensional cavities can be produced within this 
molecular canvas, enabling the creation of shapes such as letters, a helicoid and
a teddy bear. We anticipate that with further optimization of structure design,
strand synthesis and assembly procedure even larger structures could be
accessible, which could be useful for applications such as positioning functional
components.

On Mars, clay minerals are widespread in terrains that date back to the Noachian 
period (4.1 billion to 3.7 billion years ago). It is thought that the Martian
basaltic crust reacted with liquid water during this time to form hydrated clay
minerals. Here we propose, however, that a substantial proportion of these clays 
was formed when Mars' primary crust reacted with a dense steam or supercritical
atmosphere of water and carbon dioxide that was outgassed during magma ocean
cooling. We present experimental evidence that shows rapid clay formation under
conditions that would have been present at the base of such an atmosphere and
also deeper in the porous crust. Furthermore, we explore the fate of a primordial
clay-rich layer with the help of a parameterized crustal evolution model; we find
that the primordial clay is locally disrupted by impacts and buried by
impact-ejected material and by erupted volcanic material, but that it survives as
a mostly coherent layer at depth, with limited surface exposures. These exposures
are similar to those observed in remotely sensed orbital data from Mars. Our
results can explain the present distribution of many clays on Mars, and the
anomalously low density of the Martian crust in comparison with expectations.

Natural biomolecular assemblies such as molecular motors, enzymes, viruses and
subcellular structures often form by self-limiting hierarchical oligomerization
of multiple subunits. Large structures can also assemble efficiently from a few
components by combining hierarchical assembly and symmetry, a strategy
exemplified by viral capsids. De novo protein design and RNA and DNA
nanotechnology aim to mimic these capabilities, but the bottom-up construction of
artificial structures with the dimensions and complexity of viruses and other
subcellular components remains challenging. Here we show that natural assembly
principles can be combined with the methods of DNA origami to produce
gigadalton-scale structures with controlled sizes. DNA sequence information is
used to encode the shapes of individual DNA origami building blocks, and the
geometry and details of the interactions between these building blocks then
control their copy numbers, positions and orientations within higher-order
assemblies. We illustrate this strategy by creating planar rings of up to 350
nanometres in diameter and with atomic masses of up to 330 megadaltons,
micrometre-long, thick tubes commensurate in size to some bacilli, and
three-dimensional polyhedral assemblies with sizes of up to 1.2 gigadaltons and
450 nanometres in diameter. We achieve efficient assembly, with yields of up to
90 per cent, by using building blocks with validated structure and sufficient
rigidity, and an accurate design with interaction motifs that ensure that
hierarchical assembly is self-limiting and able to proceed in equilibrium to
allow for error correction. We expect that our method, which enables the
self-assembly of structures with sizes approaching that of viruses and cellular
organelles, can readily be used to create a range of other complex structures
with well defined sizes, by exploiting the modularity and high degree of
addressability of the DNA origami building blocks used.

Self-assembled DNA nanostructures enable nanometre-precise patterning that can be
used to create programmable molecular machines and arrays of functional
materials. DNA origami is particularly versatile in this context because each DNA
strand in the origami nanostructure occupies a unique position and can serve as a
uniquely addressable pixel. However, the scale of such structures has been
limited to about 0.05 square micrometres, hindering applications that demand a
larger layout and integration with more conventional patterning methods.
Hierarchical multistage assembly of simple sets of tiles can in principle
overcome this limitation, but so far has not been sufficiently robust to enable
successful implementation of larger structures using DNA origami tiles. Here we
show that by using simple local assembly rules that are modified and applied
recursively throughout a hierarchical, multistage assembly process, a small and
constant set of unique DNA strands can be used to create DNA origami arrays of
increasing size and with arbitrary patterns. We illustrate this method, which we 
term 'fractal assembly', by producing DNA origami arrays with sizes of up to 0.5 
square micrometres and with up to 8,704 pixels, allowing us to render images such
as the Mona Lisa and a rooster. We find that self-assembly of the tiles into
arrays is unaffected by changes in surface patterns on the tiles, and that the
yield of the fractal assembly process corresponds to about 0.95m - 1 for arrays
containing m tiles. When used in conjunction with a software tool that we
developed that converts an arbitrary pattern into DNA sequences and experimental 
protocols, our assembly method is readily accessible and will facilitate the
construction of sophisticated materials and devices with sizes similar to that of
a bacterium using DNA nanostructures.

Greater future global warming inferred from Earth's recent energy budget.

California, USA.

Climate models provide the principal means of projecting global warming over the 
remainder of the twenty-first century but modelled estimates of warming vary by a
factor of approximately two even under the same radiative forcing scenarios.
Across-model relationships between currently observable attributes of the climate
system and the simulated magnitude of future warming have the potential to inform
projections. Here we show that robust across-model relationships exist between
the global spatial patterns of several fundamental attributes of Earth's
top-of-atmosphere energy budget and the magnitude of projected global warming.
When we constrain the model projections with observations, we obtain greater
means and narrower ranges of future global warming across the major radiative
forcing scenarios, in general. In particular, we find that the observationally
informed warming projection for the end of the twenty-first century for the
steepest radiative forcing scenario is about 15 per cent warmer (+0.5 degrees
Celsius) with a reduction of about a third in the two-standard-deviation spread
(-1.2 degrees Celsius) relative to the raw model projections reported by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our results suggest that achieving any
given global temperature stabilization target will require steeper greenhouse gas
emissions reductions than previously calculated.

DNA nanotechnology, in particular DNA origami, enables the bottom-up
self-assembly of micrometre-scale, three-dimensional structures with
nanometre-precise features. These structures are customizable in that they can be
site-specifically functionalized or constructed to exhibit machine-like or
logic-gating behaviour. Their use has been limited to applications that require
only small amounts of material (of the order of micrograms), owing to the
limitations of current production methods. But many proposed applications, for
example as therapeutic agents or in complex materials, could be realized if more 
material could be used. In DNA origami, a nanostructure is assembled from a very 
long single-stranded scaffold molecule held in place by many short
single-stranded staple oligonucleotides. Only the bacteriophage-derived scaffold 
molecules are amenable to scalable and efficient mass production; the shorter
staple strands are obtained through costly solid-phase synthesis or enzymatic
processes. Here we show that single strands of DNA of virtually arbitrary length 
and with virtually arbitrary sequences can be produced in a scalable and
cost-efficient manner by using bacteriophages to generate single-stranded
precursor DNA that contains target strand sequences interleaved with
self-excising 'cassettes', with each cassette comprising two Zn2+-dependent
DNA-cleaving DNA enzymes. We produce all of the necessary single strands of DNA
for several DNA origami using shaker-flask cultures, and demonstrate end-to-end
production of macroscopic amounts of a DNA origami nanorod in a litre-scale
stirred-tank bioreactor. Our method is compatible with existing DNA origami
design frameworks and retains the modularity and addressability of DNA origami
objects that are necessary for implementing custom modifications using functional
groups. With all of the production and purification steps amenable to scaling, we
expect that our method will expand the scope of DNA nanotechnology in many areas 
of science and technology.

Eukaryotic transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is an important and well-conserved 
sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that preferentially removes DNA lesions
from the template strand that block translocation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). 
Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB, also known as ERCC6) protein in humans (or its
yeast orthologues, Rad26 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhp26 in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is among the first proteins to be recruited to the
lesion-arrested Pol II during the initiation of eukaryotic TCR. Mutations in CSB 
are associated with the autosomal-recessive neurological disorder Cockayne
syndrome, which is characterized by progeriod features, growth failure and
photosensitivity. The molecular mechanism of eukaryotic TCR initiation remains
unclear, with several long-standing unanswered questions. How cells distinguish
DNA lesion-arrested Pol II from other forms of arrested Pol II, the role of CSB
in TCR initiation, and how CSB interacts with the arrested Pol II complex are all
unknown. The lack of structures of CSB or the Pol II-CSB complex has hindered our
ability to address these questions. Here we report the structure of the S.
cerevisiae Pol II-Rad26 complex solved by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure
reveals that Rad26 binds to the DNA upstream of Pol II, where it markedly alters 
its path. Our structural and functional data suggest that the conserved
Swi2/Snf2-family core ATPase domain promotes the forward movement of Pol II, and 
elucidate key roles for Rad26 in both TCR and transcription elongation.

The ability to regenerate missing body parts exists throughout the animal
kingdom. Positional information is crucial for regeneration, but how it is
harboured and used by differentiated tissues is poorly understood. In planarians,
positional information has been identified from study of phenotypes caused by RNA
interference in which the wrong tissues are regenerated. For example, inhibition 
of the Wnt signalling pathway leads to regeneration of heads in place of tails.
Characterization of these phenotypes has led to the identification of position
control genes (PCGs)-genes that are expressed in a constitutive and regional
manner and are associated with patterning. Most PCGs are expressed within
planarian muscle; however, how muscle is specified and how different muscle
subsets affect regeneration is unknown. Here we show that different muscle fibres
have distinct regulatory roles during regeneration in the planarian Schmidtea
mediterranea. myoD is required for formation of a specific muscle cell subset:
the longitudinal fibres, oriented along the anterior-posterior axis. Loss of
longitudinal fibres led to complete regeneration failure because of defects in
regeneration initiation. A different transcription factor-encoding gene, nkx1-1, 
is required for the formation of circular fibres, oriented along the
medial-lateral axis. Loss of circular fibres led to a bifurcated
anterior-posterior axis with fused heads forming in single anterior blastemas.
Whereas muscle is often viewed as a strictly contractile tissue, these findings
reveal that different muscle types have distinct and specific regulatory roles in
wound signalling and patterning to enable regeneration.

Environmental nutrient levels impact cancer cell metabolism, resulting in
context-dependent gene essentiality. Here, using loss-of-function screening based
on RNA interference, we show that environmental oxygen levels are a major driver 
of differential essentiality between in vitro model systems and in vivo tumours. 
Above the 3-8% oxygen concentration typical of most tissues, we find that cancer 
cells depend on high levels of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic enzyme NFS1. 
Mammary or subcutaneous tumours grow despite suppression of NFS1, whereas
metastatic or primary lung tumours do not. Consistent with a role in surviving
the high oxygen environment of incipient lung tumours, NFS1 lies in a region of
genomic amplification present in lung adenocarcinoma and is most highly expressed
in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. NFS1 activity is particularly important
for maintaining the iron-sulfur co-factors present in multiple cell-essential
proteins upon exposure to oxygen compared to other forms of oxidative damage.
Furthermore, insufficient iron-sulfur cluster maintenance robustly activates the 
iron-starvation response and, in combination with inhibition of glutathione
biosynthesis, triggers ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death.
Suppression of NFS1 cooperates with inhibition of cysteine transport to trigger
ferroptosis in vitro and slow tumour growth. Therefore, lung adenocarcinomas
select for expression of a pathway that confers resistance to high oxygen tension
and protects cells from undergoing ferroptosis in response to oxidative damage.

Small, approximately 10-kilobase microhomology-mediated tandem duplications are
abundant in the genomes of BRCA1-linked but not BRCA2-linked breast cancer. Here 
we define the mechanism underlying this rearrangement signature. We show that, in
primary mammalian cells, BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses the formation of tandem
duplications at a site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier imposed by
the binding of Tus proteins to an array of Ter sites. BRCA1 has no equivalent
role at chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks, indicating that tandem
duplications form specifically at stalled forks. Tandem duplications in BRCA1
mutant cells arise by a replication restart-bypass mechanism terminated by end
joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming
complex tandem duplication breakpoints. Solitary DNA ends form directly at
Tus-Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in tandem duplication formation. 
Furthermore, BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with ~10 kilobase tandem
duplications in ovarian cancer. This tandem duplicator phenotype may be a general
signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer.

Neutrinos interact only very weakly, so they are extremely penetrating. The
theoretical neutrino-nucleon interaction cross-section, however, increases with
increasing neutrino energy, and neutrinos with energies above 40
teraelectronvolts (TeV) are expected to be absorbed as they pass through the
Earth. Experimentally, the cross-section has been determined only at the
relatively low energies (below 0.4 TeV) that are available at neutrino beams from
accelerators. Here we report a measurement of neutrino absorption by the Earth
using a sample of 10,784 energetic upward-going neutrino-induced muons. The flux 
of high-energy neutrinos transiting long paths through the Earth is attenuated
compared to a reference sample that follows shorter trajectories. Using a fit to 
the two-dimensional distribution of muon energy and zenith angle, we determine
the neutrino-nucleon interaction cross-section for neutrino energies 6.3-980 TeV,
more than an order of magnitude higher than previous measurements. The measured
cross-section is about 1.3 times the prediction of the standard model, consistent
with the expectations for charged- and neutral-current interactions. We do not
observe a large increase in the cross-section with neutrino energy, in contrast
with the predictions of some theoretical models, including those invoking more
compact spatial dimensions or the production of leptoquarks. This cross-section
measurement can be used to set limits on the existence of some hypothesized
beyond-standard-model particles, including leptoquarks.

The human gut microbiota produces dozens of metabolites that accumulate in the
bloodstream, where they can have systemic effects on the host. Although these
small molecules commonly reach concentrations similar to those achieved by
pharmaceutical agents, remarkably little is known about the microbial metabolic
pathways that produce them. Here we use a combination of genetics and metabolic
profiling to characterize a pathway from the gut symbiont Clostridium sporogenes 
that generates aromatic amino acid metabolites. Our results reveal that this
pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host 
serum. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine)
serve as substrates for the pathway, and it involves branching and alternative
reductases for specific intermediates. By genetically manipulating C. sporogenes,
we modulate serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice, and show that 
in turn this affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. This work has
the potential to provide the basis of a systematic effort to engineer the
molecular output of the gut bacterial community.

Although individuals age and die with time, an animal species can continue
indefinitely, because of its immortal germ-cell lineage. How the germline avoids 
transmitting damage from one generation to the next remains a fundamental
question in biology. Here we identify a lysosomal switch that enhances germline
proteostasis before fertilization. We find that Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes
whose maturation is arrested by the absence of sperm exhibit hallmarks of
proteostasis collapse, including protein aggregation. Remarkably, sperm-secreted 
hormones re-establish oocyte proteostasis once fertilization becomes imminent.
Key to this restoration is activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a
proton pump that acidifies lysosomes. Sperm stimulate V-ATPase activity in
oocytes by signalling the degradation of GLD-1, a translational repressor that
blocks V-ATPase synthesis. Activated lysosomes, in turn, promote a metabolic
shift that mobilizes protein aggregates for degradation, and reset proteostasis
by enveloping and clearing the aggregates. Lysosome acidification also occurs
during Xenopus oocyte maturation; thus, a lysosomal switch that enhances oocyte
proteostasis in anticipation of fertilization may be conserved in other species.

Site-selective and stereoselective functionalization of non-activated tertiary
C-H bonds.

The synthesis of complex organic compounds usually relies on controlling the
reactions of the functional groups. In recent years, it has become possible to
carry out reactions directly on the C-H bonds, previously considered to be
unreactive. One of the major challenges is to control the site-selectivity
because most organic compounds have many similar C-H bonds. The most well
developed procedures so far rely on the use of substrate control, in which the
substrate has one inherently more reactive C-H bond or contains a directing group
or the reaction is conducted intramolecularly so that a specific C-H bond is
favoured. A more versatile but more challenging approach is to use catalysts to
control which site in the substrate is functionalized. p450 enzymes exhibit C-H
oxidation site-selectivity, in which the enzyme scaffold causes a specific C-H
bond to be functionalized by placing it close to the iron-oxo haem complex.
Several studies have aimed to emulate this enzymatic site-selectivity with
designed transition-metal catalysts but it is difficult to achieve exceptionally 
high levels of site-selectivity. Recently, we reported a dirhodium catalyst for
the site-selective functionalization of the most accessible non-activated (that
is, not next to a functional group) secondary C-H bonds by means of
rhodium-carbene-induced C-H insertion. Here we describe another dirhodium
catalyst that has a very different reactivity profile. Instead of the secondary
C-H bond, the new catalyst is capable of precise site-selectivity at the most
accessible tertiary C-H bonds. Using this catalyst, we modify several natural
products, including steroids and a vitamin E derivative, indicating the
applicability of this method of synthesis to the late-stage functionalization of 
complex molecules. These studies show it is possible to achieve site-selectivity 
at different positions within a substrate simply by selecting the appropriate
catalyst. We hope that this work will inspire the design of even more
sophisticated catalysts, such that catalyst-controlled C-H functionalization
becomes a broadly applied strategy for the synthesis of complex molecules.

A Western lifestyle with high salt consumption can lead to hypertension and
cardiovascular disease. High salt may additionally drive autoimmunity by inducing
T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which can also contribute to hypertension. Induction of
TH17 cells depends on gut microbiota; however, the effect of salt on the gut
microbiome is unknown. Here we show that high salt intake affects the gut
microbiome in mice, particularly by depleting Lactobacillus murinus.
Consequently, treatment of mice with L. murinus prevented salt-induced
aggravation of actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and
salt-sensitive hypertension by modulating TH17 cells. In line with these
findings, a moderate high-salt challenge in a pilot study in humans reduced
intestinal survival of Lactobacillus spp., increased TH17 cells and increased
blood pressure. Our results connect high salt intake to the gut-immune axis and
highlight the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target to counteract
salt-sensitive conditions.

How wealth is distributed among households provides insight into the fundamental 
characters of societies and the opportunities they afford for social mobility.
However, economic inequality has been hard to study in ancient societies for
which we do not have written records, which adds to the challenge of placing
current wealth disparities into a long-term perspective. Although various
archaeological proxies for wealth, such as burial goods or exotic or
expensive-to-manufacture goods in household assemblages, have been proposed, the 
first is not clearly connected with households, and the second is confounded by
abandonment mode and other factors. As a result, numerous questions remain
concerning the growth of wealth disparities, including their connection to the
development of domesticated plants and animals and to increases in sociopolitical
scale. Here we show that wealth disparities generally increased with the
domestication of plants and animals and with increased sociopolitical scale,
using Gini coefficients computed over the single consistent proxy of house-size
distributions. However, unexpected differences in the responses of societies to
these factors in North America and Mesoamerica, and in Eurasia, became evident
after the end of the Neolithic period. We argue that the generally higher wealth 
disparities identified in post-Neolithic Eurasia were initially due to the
greater availability of large mammals that could be domesticated, because they
allowed more profitable agricultural extensification, and also eventually led to 
the development of a mounted warrior elite able to expand polities (political
units that cohere via identity, ability to mobilize resources, or governance) to 
sizes that were not possible in North America and Mesoamerica before the arrival 
of Europeans. We anticipate that this analysis will stimulate other work to
enlarge this sample to include societies in South America, Africa, South Asia and
Oceania that were under-sampled or not included in this study.

Membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells mediates the biogenesis of organelles,
vesicular traffic between them, and exo- and endocytosis of important signalling 
molecules, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Distinct tasks in
intracellular membrane fusion have been assigned to conserved protein systems.
Tethering proteins mediate the initial recognition and attachment of membranes,
whereas SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein
receptor) protein complexes are considered as the core fusion engine. SNARE
complexes provide mechanical energy to distort membranes and drive them through a
hemifusion intermediate towards the formation of a fusion pore. This last step is
highly energy-demanding. Here we combine the in vivo and in vitro fusion of yeast
vacuoles with molecular simulations to show that tethering proteins are critical 
for overcoming the final energy barrier to fusion pore formation. SNAREs alone
drive vacuoles only into the hemifused state. Tethering proteins greatly increase
the volume of SNARE complexes and deform the site of hemifusion, which lowers the
energy barrier for pore opening and provides the driving force. Thereby,
tethering proteins assume a crucial mechanical role in the terminal stage of
membrane fusion that is likely to be conserved at multiple steps of vesicular
traffic. We therefore propose that SNAREs and tethering proteins should be
considered as a single, non-dissociable device that drives fusion. The core
fusion machinery may then be larger and more complex than previously thought.

A quantum simulator is a type of quantum computer that controls the interactions 
between quantum bits (or qubits) in a way that can be mapped to certain quantum
many-body problems. As it becomes possible to exert more control over larger
numbers of qubits, such simulators will be able to tackle a wider range of
problems, such as materials design and molecular modelling, with the ultimate
limit being a universal quantum computer that can solve general classes of hard
problems. Here we use a quantum simulator composed of up to 53 qubits to study
non-equilibrium dynamics in the transverse-field Ising model with long-range
interactions. We observe a dynamical phase transition after a sudden change of
the Hamiltonian, in a regime in which conventional statistical mechanics does not
apply. The qubits are represented by the spins of trapped ions, which can be
prepared in various initial pure states. We apply a global long-range Ising
interaction with controllable strength and range, and measure each individual
qubit with an efficiency of nearly 99 per cent. Such high efficiency means that
arbitrary many-body correlations between qubits can be measured in a single shot,
enabling the dynamical phase transition to be probed directly and revealing
computationally intractable features that rely on the long-range interactions and
high connectivity between qubits.

Since at least the last common ancestor of all life on Earth, genetic information
has been stored in a four-letter alphabet that is propagated and retrieved by the
formation of two base pairs. The central goal of synthetic biology is to create
new life forms and functions, and the most general route to this goal is the
creation of semi-synthetic organisms whose DNA harbours two additional letters
that form a third, unnatural base pair. Previous efforts to generate such
semi-synthetic organisms culminated in the creation of a strain of Escherichia
coli that, by virtue of a nucleoside triphosphate transporter from Phaeodactylum 
tricornutum, imports the requisite unnatural triphosphates from its medium and
then uses them to replicate a plasmid containing the unnatural base pair
dNaM-dTPT3. Although the semi-synthetic organism stores increased information
when compared to natural organisms, retrieval of the information requires in vivo
transcription of the unnatural base pair into mRNA and tRNA, aminoacylation of
the tRNA with a non-canonical amino acid, and efficient participation of the
unnatural base pair in decoding at the ribosome. Here we report the in vivo
transcription of DNA containing dNaM and dTPT3 into mRNAs with two different
unnatural codons and tRNAs with cognate unnatural anticodons, and their efficient
decoding at the ribosome to direct the site-specific incorporation of natural or 
non-canonical amino acids into superfolder green fluorescent protein. The results
demonstrate that interactions other than hydrogen bonding can contribute to every
step of information storage and retrieval. The resulting semi-synthetic organism 
both encodes and retrieves increased information and should serve as a platform
for the creation of new life forms and functions.

Controllable, coherent many-body systems can provide insights into the
fundamental properties of quantum matter, enable the realization of new quantum
phases and could ultimately lead to computational systems that outperform
existing computers based on classical approaches. Here we demonstrate a method
for creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines deterministically 
prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold atoms with strong,
coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg states. We realize a
programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system
sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into
spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the
high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the
phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust
many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a 
rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase
boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a
programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum
algorithms.

Volatile element delivery and retention played a fundamental part in Earth's
formation and subsequent chemical differentiation. The heavy halogens-chlorine
(Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I)-are key tracers of accretionary processes owing
to their high volatility and incompatibility, but have low abundances in most
geological and planetary materials. However, noble gas proxy isotopes produced
during neutron irradiation provide a high-sensitivity tool for the determination 
of heavy halogen abundances. Using such isotopes, here we show that Cl, Br and I 
abundances in carbonaceous, enstatite, Rumuruti and primitive ordinary chondrites
are about 6 times, 9 times and 15-37 times lower, respectively, than previously
reported and usually accepted estimates. This is independent of the oxidation
state or petrological type of the chondrites. The ratios Br/Cl and I/Cl in all
studied chondrites show a limited range, indistinguishable from bulk silicate
Earth estimates. Our results demonstrate that the halogen depletion of bulk
silicate Earth relative to primitive meteorites is consistent with the depletion 
of lithophile elements of similar volatility. These results for carbonaceous
chondrites reveal that late accretion, constrained to a maximum of 0.5 ± 0.2 per 
cent of Earth's silicate mass, cannot solely account for present-day terrestrial 
halogen inventories. It is estimated that 80-90 per cent of heavy halogens are
concentrated in Earth's surface reservoirs and have not undergone the extreme
early loss observed in atmosphere-forming elements. Therefore, in addition to
late-stage terrestrial accretion of halogens and mantle degassing, which has
removed less than half of Earth's dissolved mantle gases, the efficient
extraction of halogen-rich fluids from the solid Earth during the earliest stages
of terrestrial differentiation is also required to explain the presence of these 
heavy halogens at the surface. The hydropilic nature of halogens, whereby they
track with water, supports this requirement, and is consistent with volatile-rich
or water-rich late-stage terrestrial accretion.

An efficient and direct method of catalytic conversion of methane to liquid
methanol and other oxygenates would be of considerable practical value. However, 
it remains an unsolved problem in catalysis, as typically it involves expensive
or corrosive oxidants or reaction media that are not amenable to
commercialization. Although methane can be directly converted to methanol using
molecular oxygen under mild conditions in the gas phase, the process is either
stoichiometric (and therefore requires a water extraction step) or is too slow
and low-yielding to be practical. Methane could, in principle, also be
transformed through direct oxidative carbonylation to acetic acid, which is
commercially obtained through methane steam reforming, methanol synthesis, and
subsequent methanol carbonylation on homogeneous catalysts. However, an effective
catalyst for the direct carbonylation of methane to acetic acid, which might
enable the economical small-scale utilization of natural gas that is currently
flared or stranded, has not yet been reported. Here we show that mononuclear
rhodium species, anchored on a zeolite or titanium dioxide support suspended in
aqueous solution, catalyse the direct conversion of methane to methanol and
acetic acid, using oxygen and carbon monoxide under mild conditions. We find that
the two products form through independent pathways, which allows us to tune the
conversion: three-hour-long batch-reactor tests conducted at 150 degrees Celsius,
using either the zeolite-supported or the titanium-dioxide-supported catalyst,
yield around 22,000 micromoles of acetic acid per gram of catalyst, or around 230
micromoles of methanol per gram of catalyst, respectively, with selectivities of 
60-100 per cent. We anticipate that these unusually high activities, despite
still being too low for commercial application, may guide the development of
optimized catalysts and practical processes for the direct conversion of methane 
to methanol, acetic acid and other useful chemicals.

The spontaneous deamination of cytosine is a major source of transitions from C•G
to T•A base pairs, which account for half of known pathogenic point mutations in 
humans. The ability to efficiently convert targeted A•T base pairs to G•C could
therefore advance the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The deamination of
adenine yields inosine, which is treated as guanine by polymerases, but no
enzymes are known to deaminate adenine in DNA. Here we describe adenine base
editors (ABEs) that mediate the conversion of A•T to G•C in genomic DNA. We
evolved a transfer RNA adenosine deaminase to operate on DNA when fused to a
catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas9 mutant. Extensive directed evolution and
protein engineering resulted in seventh-generation ABEs that convert targeted A•T
base pairs efficiently to G•C (approximately 50% efficiency in human cells) with 
high product purity (typically at least 99.9%) and low rates of indels (typically
no more than 0.1%). ABEs introduce point mutations more efficiently and cleanly, 
and with less off-target genome modification, than a current Cas9 nuclease-based 
method, and can install disease-correcting or disease-suppressing mutations in
human cells. Together with previous base editors, ABEs enable the direct,
programmable introduction of all four transition mutations without
double-stranded DNA cleavage.

Chemical modifications of human ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are introduced during
biogenesis and have been implicated in the dysregulation of protein synthesis, as
is found in cancer and other diseases. However, their role in this phenomenon is 
unknown. Here we visualize more than 130 individual rRNA modifications in the
three-dimensional structure of the human ribosome, explaining their structural
and functional roles. In addition to a small number of universally conserved
sites, we identify many eukaryote- or human-specific modifications and unique
sites that form an extended shell in comparison to bacterial ribosomes, and which
stabilize the RNA. Several of the modifications are associated with the binding
sites of three ribosome-targeting antibiotics, or are associated with degenerate 
states in cancer, such as keto alkylations on nucleotide bases reminiscent of
specialized ribosomes. This high-resolution structure of the human 80S ribosome
paves the way towards understanding the role of epigenetic rRNA modifications in 
human diseases and suggests new possibilities for designing selective inhibitors 
and therapeutic drugs.

Current sequencing-based analyses of faecal microbiota quantify microbial taxa
and metabolic pathways as fractions of the sample sequence library generated by
each analysis. Although these relative approaches permit detection of
disease-associated microbiome variation, they are limited in their ability to
reveal the interplay between microbiota and host health. Comparative analyses of 
relative microbiome data cannot provide information about the extent or
directionality of changes in taxa abundance or metabolic potential. If microbial 
load varies substantially between samples, relative profiling will hamper
attempts to link microbiome features to quantitative data such as physiological
parameters or metabolite concentrations. Saliently, relative approaches ignore
the possibility that altered overall microbiota abundance itself could be a key
identifier of a disease-associated ecosystem configuration. To enable genuine
characterization of host-microbiota interactions, microbiome research must
exchange ratios for counts. Here we build a workflow for the quantitative
microbiome profiling of faecal material, through parallelization of amplicon
sequencing and flow cytometric enumeration of microbial cells. We observe up to
tenfold differences in the microbial loads of healthy individuals and relate this
variation to enterotype differentiation. We show how microbial abundances
underpin both microbiota variation between individuals and covariation with host 
phenotype. Quantitative profiling bypasses compositionality effects in the
reconstruction of gut microbiota interaction networks and reveals that the
taxonomic trade-off between Bacteroides and Prevotella is an artefact of relative
microbiome analyses. Finally, we identify microbial load as a key driver of
observed microbiota alterations in a cohort of patients with Crohn's disease,
here associated with a low-cell-count Bacteroides enterotype (as defined through 
relative profiling).

Aegilops tauschii is the diploid progenitor of the D genome of hexaploid wheat
(Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) and an important genetic resource for wheat. 
The large size and highly repetitive nature of the Ae. tauschii genome has until 
now precluded the development of a reference-quality genome sequence. Here we use
an array of advanced technologies, including ordered-clone genome sequencing,
whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and BioNano optical genome mapping, to generate 
a reference-quality genome sequence for Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata accession
AL8/78, which is closely related to the wheat D genome. We show that compared to 
other sequenced plant genomes, including a much larger conifer genome, the Ae.
tauschii genome contains unprecedented amounts of very similar repeated
sequences. Our genome comparisons reveal that the Ae. tauschii genome has a
greater number of dispersed duplicated genes than other sequenced genomes and its
chromosomes have been structurally evolving an order of magnitude faster than
those of other grass genomes. The decay of colinearity with other grass genomes
correlates with recombination rates along chromosomes. We propose that the vast
amounts of very similar repeated sequences cause frequent errors in recombination
and lead to gene duplications and structural chromosome changes that drive fast
genome evolution.

Glycosylation is a fundamental cellular process that, in eukaryotes, occurs in
the lumen of both the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. Nucleotide
sugar transporters (NSTs) are an essential component of the glycosylation
pathway, providing the diverse range of substrates required for the
glycosyltransferases. NSTs are linked to several developmental and immune
disorders in humans, and in pathogenic microbes they have an important role in
virulence. How NSTs recognize and transport activated monosaccharides, however,
is currently unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of an NST, the
GDP-mannose transporter Vrg4, in both the substrate-free and the bound states. A 
hitherto unobserved requirement of short-chain lipids in activating the
transporter supports a model for regulation within the highly dynamic membranes
of the Golgi apparatus. Our results provide a structural basis for understanding 
nucleotide sugar recognition, and provide insights into the transport and
regulatory mechanism of this family of intracellular transporters.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal cancer with fewer than 7% of
patients surviving past 5 years. T-cell immunity has been linked to the
exceptional outcome of the few long-term survivors, yet the relevant antigens
remain unknown. Here we use genetic, immunohistochemical and transcriptional
immunoprofiling, computational biophysics, and functional assays to identify
T-cell antigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer. Using whole-exome
sequencing and in silico neoantigen prediction, we found that tumours with both
the highest neoantigen number and the most abundant CD8+ T-cell infiltrates, but 
neither alone, stratified patients with the longest survival. Investigating the
specific neoantigen qualities promoting T-cell activation in long-term survivors,
we discovered that these individuals were enriched in neoantigen qualities
defined by a fitness model, and neoantigens in the tumour antigen MUC16 (also
known as CA125). A neoantigen quality fitness model conferring greater
immunogenicity to neoantigens with differential presentation and homology to
infectious disease-derived peptides identified long-term survivors in two
independent datasets, whereas a neoantigen quantity model ascribing greater
immunogenicity to increasing neoantigen number alone did not. We detected
intratumoural and lasting circulating T-cell reactivity to both high-quality and 
MUC16 neoantigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer, including clones
with specificity to both high-quality neoantigens and predicted cross-reactive
microbial epitopes, consistent with neoantigen molecular mimicry. Notably, we
observed selective loss of high-quality and MUC16 neoantigenic clones on
metastatic progression, suggesting neoantigen immunoediting. Our results identify
neoantigens with unique qualities as T-cell targets in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. More broadly, we identify neoantigen quality as a biomarker for
immunogenic tumours that may guide the application of immunotherapies.

Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies enable the host immune system to recognize
and destroy tumour cells. Their clinical activity has been correlated with
activated T-cell recognition of neoantigens, which are tumour-specific, mutated
peptides presented on the surface of cancer cells. Here we present a fitness
model for tumours based on immune interactions of neoantigens that predicts
response to immunotherapy. Two main factors determine neoantigen fitness: the
likelihood of neoantigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) and subsequent recognition by T cells. We estimate these components using
the relative MHC binding affinity of each neoantigen to its wild type and a
nonlinear dependence on sequence similarity of neoantigens to known antigens. To 
describe the evolution of a heterogeneous tumour, we evaluate its fitness as a
weighted effect of dominant neoantigens in the subclones of the tumour. Our model
predicts survival in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients with melanoma and
anti-PD-1-treated patients with lung cancer. Importantly, low-fitness neoantigens
identified by our method may be leveraged for developing novel immunotherapies.
By using an immune fitness model to study immunotherapy, we reveal broad
similarities between the evolution of tumours and rapidly evolving pathogens.

Gliding is a distinctive locomotion type that has been identified in only three
mammal species from the Mesozoic era. Here we describe another Jurassic glider
that belongs to the euharamiyidan mammals and shows hair details on its gliding
membrane that are highly similar to those of extant gliding mammals. This species
possesses a five-boned auditory apparatus consisting of the stapes, incus,
malleus, ectotympanic and surangular, representing, to our knowledge, the
earliest known definitive mammalian middle ear. The surangular has not been
previously identified in any mammalian middle ear, and the morphology of each
auditory bone differs from those of known mammals and their kin. We conclude that
gliding locomotion was probably common in euharamiyidans, which lends support to 
idea that there was a major adaptive radiation of mammals in the mid-Jurassic
period. The acquisition of the auditory bones in euharamiyidans was related to
the formation of the dentary-squamosal jaw joint, which allows a posterior
chewing movement, and must have evolved independently from the middle ear
structures of monotremes and therian mammals.

The metal abundance of the hot plasma that permeates galaxy clusters represents
the accumulation of heavy elements produced by billions of supernovae. Therefore,
X-ray spectroscopy of the intracluster medium provides an opportunity to
investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated over cosmic time. In
particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements (chromium, manganese, iron
and nickel) is key to understanding how the progenitors of typical type Ia
supernovae evolve and explode. Recent X-ray studies of the intracluster medium
found that the abundance ratios of these elements differ substantially from those
seen in the Sun, suggesting differences between the nature of type Ia supernovae 
in the clusters and in the Milky Way. However, because the K-shell transition
lines of chromium and manganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very
close in photon energy, high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate 
determination of the abundances of these elements. Here we report observations of
the Perseus cluster, with statistically significant detections of the resonance
emission from chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined with the
latest atomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios
with respect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our
results and modern nucleosynthesis calculations disfavours the hypothesis that
type Ia supernova progenitors are exclusively white dwarfs with masses well below
the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed
abundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into
account a combination of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova
systems, adding to the mounting evidence that both progenitor types make a
substantial contribution to cosmic chemical enrichment.

The peptide-loading complex (PLC) is a transient, multisubunit membrane complex
in the endoplasmic reticulum that is essential for establishing a hierarchical
immune response. The PLC coordinates peptide translocation into the endoplasmic
reticulum with loading and editing of major histocompatibility complex class I
(MHC-I) molecules. After final proofreading in the PLC, stable peptide-MHC-I
complexes are released to the cell surface to evoke a T-cell response against
infected or malignant cells. Sampling of different MHC-I allomorphs requires the 
precise coordination of seven different subunits in a single macromolecular
assembly, including the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1 and 
TAP2, jointly referred to as TAP), the oxidoreductase ERp57, the MHC-I
heterodimer, and the chaperones tapasin and calreticulin. The molecular
organization of and mechanistic events that take place in the PLC are unknown
owing to the heterogeneous composition and intrinsically dynamic nature of the
complex. Here, we isolate human PLC from Burkitt's lymphoma cells using an
engineered viral inhibitor as bait and determine the structure of native PLC by
electron cryo-microscopy. Two endoplasmic reticulum-resident editing modules
composed of tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57, and MHC-I are centred around TAP in a
pseudo-symmetric orientation. A multivalent chaperone network within and across
the editing modules establishes the proofreading function at two lateral binding 
platforms for MHC-I molecules. The lectin-like domain of calreticulin senses the 
MHC-I glycan, whereas the P domain reaches over the MHC-I peptide-binding pocket 
towards ERp57. This arrangement allows tapasin to facilitate peptide editing by
clamping MHC-I. The translocation pathway of TAP opens out into a large
endoplasmic reticulum lumenal cavity, confined by the membrane entry points of
tapasin and MHC-I. Two lateral windows channel the antigenic peptides to MHC-I.
Structures of PLC captured at distinct assembly states provide mechanistic
insight into the recruitment and release of MHC-I. Our work defines the molecular
symbiosis of an ABC transporter and an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone network in
MHC-I assembly and provides insight into the onset of the adaptive immune
response.

Our growing awareness of the microbial world's importance and diversity contrasts
starkly with our limited understanding of its fundamental structure. Despite
recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common
analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the
development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a
meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers
for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical
methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational
taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be
followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at
an unprecedented scale. The result is both a reference database giving global
context to DNA sequence data and a framework for incorporating data from future
studies, fostering increasingly complete characterization of Earth's microbial
diversity.

At most synapses in the brain, short-term plasticity dynamically modulates
synaptic strength. Rapid frequency-dependent changes in synaptic strength have
key roles in sensory adaptation, gain control and many other neural computations.
However, some auditory, vestibular and cerebellar synapses maintain constant
strength over a wide range of firing frequencies, and as a result efficiently
encode firing rates. Despite its apparent simplicity, frequency-invariant
transmission is difficult to achieve because of inherent synaptic nonlinearities.
Here we study frequency-invariant transmission at synapses from Purkinje cells to
deep cerebellar nuclei and at vestibular synapses in mice. Prolonged activation
of these synapses leads to initial depression, which is followed by steady-state 
responses that are frequency invariant for their physiological activity range. We
find that synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), a calcium sensor for short-term facilitation,
is present at both synapses. It was unclear why a sensor for facilitation would
be present at these and other depressing synapses. We find that at Purkinje cell 
and vestibular synapses, Syt7 supports facilitation that is normally masked by
depression, which can be revealed in wild-type mice but is absent in Syt7
knockout mice. In wild-type mice, facilitation increases with firing frequency
and counteracts depression to produce frequency-invariant transmission. In
Syt7-knockout mice, Purkinje cell and vestibular synapses exhibit conventional
use-dependent depression, weakening to a greater extent as the firing frequency
is increased. Presynaptic rescue of Syt7 expression restores both facilitation
and frequency-invariant transmission. Our results identify a function for Syt7 at
synapses that exhibit overall depression, and demonstrate that facilitation has
an unexpected and important function in producing frequency-invariant
transmission.

Interfacing fundamentally different quantum systems is key to building future
hybrid quantum networks. Such heterogeneous networks offer capabilities superior 
to those of their homogeneous counterparts, as they merge the individual
advantages of disparate quantum nodes in a single network architecture. However, 
few investigations of optical hybrid interconnections have been carried out,
owing to fundamental and technological challenges such as wavelength and
bandwidth matching of the interfacing photons. Here we report optical quantum
interconnection of two disparate matter quantum systems with photon storage
capabilities. We show that a quantum state can be transferred faithfully between 
a cold atomic ensemble and a rare-earth-doped crystal by means of a single photon
at 1,552  nanometre telecommunication wavelength, using cascaded quantum
frequency conversion. We demonstrate that quantum correlations between a photon
and a single collective spin excitation in the cold atomic ensemble can be
transferred to the solid-state system. We also show that single-photon time-bin
qubits generated in the cold atomic ensemble can be converted, stored and
retrieved from the crystal with a conditional qubit fidelity of more than 85 per 
cent. Our results open up the prospect of optically connecting quantum nodes with
different capabilities and represent an important step towards the realization of
large-scale hybrid quantum networks.

Ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) at Earth's core-mantle boundary region have
important implications for the chemical composition and thermal structure of our 
planet, but their origin has long been debated. Hydrogen-bearing iron peroxide
(FeO2Hx) in the pyrite-type crystal structure was recently found to be stable
under the conditions of the lowermost mantle. Using high-pressure experiments and
theoretical calculations, we find that iron peroxide with a varying amount of
hydrogen has a high density and high Poisson ratio as well as extremely low sound
velocities consistent with ULVZs. Here we also report a reaction between iron and
water at 86 gigapascals and 2,200 kelvin that produces FeO2Hx. This would provide
a mechanism for generating the observed volume occupied by ULVZs through the
reaction of about one-tenth the mass of Earth's ocean water in subducted hydrous 
minerals with the effectively unlimited reservoir of iron in Earth's core. Unlike
other candidates for the composition of ULVZs, FeO2Hx synthesized from the
superoxidation of iron by water would not require an extra transportation
mechanism to migrate to the core-mantle boundary. These dense FeO2Hx-rich domains
would be expected to form directly in the core-mantle boundary region and their
properties would provide an explanation for the many enigmatic seismic features
that are observed in ULVZs.

Lightning and thunderclouds are natural particle accelerators. Avalanches of
relativistic runaway electrons, which develop in electric fields within
thunderclouds, emit bremsstrahlung γ-rays. These γ-rays have been detected by
ground-based observatories, by airborne detectors and as terrestrial γ-ray
flashes from space. The energy of the γ-rays is sufficiently high that they can
trigger atmospheric photonuclear reactions that produce neutrons and eventually
positrons via β+ decay of the unstable radioactive isotopes, most notably 13N,
which is generated via 14N + γ → 13N + n, where γ denotes a photon and n a
neutron. However, this reaction has hitherto not been observed conclusively,
despite increasing observational evidence of neutrons and positrons that are
presumably derived from such reactions. Here we report ground-based observations 
of neutron and positron signals after lightning. During a thunderstorm on 6
February 2017 in Japan, a γ-ray flash with a duration of less than one
millisecond was detected at our monitoring sites 0.5-1.7 kilometres away from the
lightning. The subsequent γ-ray afterglow subsided quickly, with an exponential
decay constant of 40-60 milliseconds, and was followed by prolonged line emission
at about 0.511 megaelectronvolts, which lasted for a minute. The observed decay
timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 megaelectronvolts of the γ-ray
afterglow are well explained by de-excitation γ-rays from nuclei excited by
neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line emission corresponds to 
electron-positron annihilation, providing conclusive evidence of positrons being 
produced after the lightning.

The directed activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (C-H) is important in the
development of synthetically useful reactions, owing to the proximity-induced
reactivity and selectivity that is enabled by coordinating functional groups.
Palladium-catalysed non-directed C-H activation could potentially enable further 
useful reactions, because it can reach more distant sites and be applied to
substrates that do not contain appropriate directing groups; however, its
development has faced substantial challenges associated with the lack of
sufficiently active palladium catalysts. Currently used palladium catalysts are
reactive only with electron-rich arenes, unless an excess of arene is used, which
limits synthetic applications. Here we report a 2-pyridone ligand that binds to
palladium and accelerates non-directed C-H functionalization with arene as the
limiting reagent. This protocol is compatible with a broad range of aromatic
substrates and we demonstrate direct functionalization of advanced synthetic
intermediates, drug molecules and natural products that cannot be used in
excessive quantities. We also developed C-H olefination and carboxylation
protocols, demonstrating the applicability of our methodology to other
transformations. The site selectivity in these transformations is governed by a
combination of steric and electronic effects, with the pyridone ligand enhancing 
the influence of sterics on the selectivity, thus providing complementary
selectivity to directed C-H functionalization.

Ancient DNA studies have established that Neolithic European populations were
descended from Anatolian migrants who received a limited amount of admixture from
resident hunter-gatherers. Many open questions remain, however, about the spatial
and temporal dynamics of population interactions and admixture during the
Neolithic period. Here we investigate the population dynamics of Neolithization
across Europe using a high-resolution genome-wide ancient DNA dataset with a
total of 180 samples, of which 130 are newly reported here, from the Neolithic
and Chalcolithic periods of Hungary (6000-2900 bc, n = 100), Germany (5500-3000
bc, n = 42) and Spain (5500-2200 bc, n = 38). We find that genetic diversity was 
shaped predominantly by local processes, with varied sources and proportions of
hunter-gatherer ancestry among the three regions and through time. Admixture
between groups with different ancestry profiles was pervasive and resulted in
observable population transformation across almost all cultural transitions. Our 
results shed new light on the ways in which gene flow reshaped European
populations throughout the Neolithic period and demonstrate the potential of
time-series-based sampling and modelling approaches to elucidate multiple
dimensions of historical population interactions.

Intestinal epithelial cells absorb nutrients, respond to microbes, function as a 
barrier and help to coordinate immune responses. Here we report profiling of
53,193 individual epithelial cells from the small intestine and organoids of
mice, which enabled the identification and characterization of previously unknown
subtypes of intestinal epithelial cell and their gene signatures. We found
unexpected diversity in hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells and constructed
the taxonomy of newly identified subtypes, and distinguished between two subtypes
of tuft cell, one of which expresses the epithelial cytokine Tslp and the
pan-immune marker CD45, which was not previously associated with
non-haematopoietic cells. We also characterized the ways in which cell-intrinsic 
states and the proportions of different cell types respond to bacterial and
helminth infections: Salmonella infection caused an increase in the abundance of 
Paneth cells and enterocytes, and broad activation of an antimicrobial program;
Heligmosomoides polygyrus caused an increase in the abundance of goblet and tuft 
cells. Our survey highlights previously unidentified markers and programs,
associates sensory molecules with cell types, and uncovers principles of gut
homeostasis and response to pathogens.

The role of adaptive immunity in early cancer development is controversial. Here 
we show that chronic inflammation and fibrosis in humans and mice with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is accompanied by accumulation of
liver-resident immunoglobulin-A-producing (IgA+) cells. These cells also express 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and interleukin-10, and directly suppress liver
cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, which prevent emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma
and express a limited repertoire of T-cell receptors against tumour-associated
antigens. Whereas CD8+ T-cell ablation accelerates hepatocellular carcinoma,
genetic or pharmacological interference with IgA+ cell generation attenuates
liver carcinogenesis and induces cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated regression of
established hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings establish the importance of 
inflammation-induced suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte activation as a

DNA repair is essential to prevent the cytotoxic or mutagenic effects of various 
types of DNA lesions, which are sensed by distinct pathways to recruit repair
factors specific to the damage type. Although biochemical mechanisms for
repairing several forms of genomic insults are well understood, the upstream
signalling pathways that trigger repair are established for only certain types of
damage, such as double-stranded breaks and interstrand crosslinks. Understanding 
the upstream signalling events that mediate recognition and repair of DNA
alkylation damage is particularly important, since alkylation chemotherapy is one
of the most widely used systemic modalities for cancer treatment and because
environmental chemicals may trigger DNA alkylation. Here we demonstrate that
human cells have a previously unrecognized signalling mechanism for sensing
damage induced by alkylation. We find that the alkylation repair complex ASCC
(activating signal cointegrator complex) relocalizes to distinct nuclear foci
specifically upon exposure of cells to alkylating agents. These foci associate
with alkylated nucleotides, and coincide spatially with elongating RNA polymerase
II and splicing components. Proper recruitment of the repair complex requires
recognition of K63-linked polyubiquitin by the CUE (coupling of ubiquitin
conjugation to ER degradation) domain of the subunit ASCC2. Loss of this subunit 
impedes alkylation adduct repair kinetics and increases sensitivity to alkylating
agents, but not other forms of DNA damage. We identify RING finger protein 113A
(RNF113A) as the E3 ligase responsible for upstream ubiquitin signalling in the
ASCC pathway. Cells from patients with X-linked trichothiodystrophy, which
harbour a mutation in RNF113A, are defective in ASCC foci formation and are
hypersensitive to alkylating agents. Together, our work reveals a previously
unrecognized ubiquitin-dependent pathway induced specifically to repair
alkylation damage, shedding light on the molecular mechanism of X-linked
trichothiodystrophy.

Phosphorylation-type (P-type) ATPases are ubiquitous primary transporters that
pump cations across cell membranes through the formation and breakdown of a
phosphoenzyme intermediate. Structural investigations suggest that the transport 
mechanism is defined by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains of the 
protein that are allosterically coupled to transmembrane helices so as to expose 
ion binding sites to alternate sides of the membrane. Here, we have used
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to directly observe
conformational changes associated with the functional transitions in the Listeria
monocytogenes Ca2+-ATPase (LMCA1), an orthologue of eukaryotic Ca2+-ATPases. We
identify key intermediates with no known crystal structures and show that Ca2+
efflux by LMCA1 is rate-limited by phosphoenzyme formation. The transport process
involves reversible steps and an irreversible step that follows release of ADP
and extracellular release of Ca2+.

Interferon-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) mediate cell-autonomous
antimicrobial defences. Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative cytoplasmic
free-living bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery, encodes a repertoire of
highly similar type III secretion system effectors called invasion plasmid
antigen Hs (IpaHs). IpaHs represent a large family of bacterial
ubiquitin-ligases, but their function is poorly understood. Here we show that S. 
flexneri infection induces rapid proteasomal degradation of human guanylate
binding protein-1 (hGBP1). We performed a transposon screen to identify a
mutation in the S. flexneri gene ipaH9.8 that prevented hGBP1 degradation.
IpaH9.8 targets hGBP1 for degradation via Lys48-linked ubiquitination. IpaH9.8
targets multiple GBPs in the cytoplasm independently of their nucleotide-bound
states and their differential function in antibacterial defence, promoting S.
flexneri replication and resulting in the death of infected mice. In the absence 
of IpaH9.8, or when binding of GBPs to IpaH9.8 was disrupted, GBPs such as hGBP1 
and mouse GBP2 (mGBP2) translocated to intracellular S. flexneri and inhibited
bacterial replication. Like wild-type mice, mutant mice deficient in GBP1-3, 5
and 7 succumbed to S. flexneri infection, but unlike wild-type mice, mice
deficient in these GBPs were also susceptible to S. flexneri lacking ipaH9.8. The
mode of IpaH9.8 action highlights the functional importance of GBPs in
antibacterial defences. IpaH9.8 and S. flexneri provide a unique system for
dissecting GBP-mediated immunity.

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a severe and often lethal genetic
disease caused by mutations in genes encoding the basement membrane component
laminin-332. Surviving patients with JEB develop chronic wounds to the skin and
mucosa, which impair their quality of life and lead to skin cancer. Here we show 
that autologous transgenic keratinocyte cultures regenerated an entire, fully
functional epidermis on a seven-year-old child suffering from a devastating,
life-threatening form of JEB. The proviral integration pattern was maintained in 
vivo and epidermal renewal did not cause any clonal selection. Clonal tracing
showed that the human epidermis is sustained not by equipotent progenitors, but
by a limited number of long-lived stem cells, detected as holoclones, that can
extensively self-renew in vitro and in vivo and produce progenitors that
replenish terminally differentiated keratinocytes. This study provides a
blueprint that can be applied to other stem cell-mediated combined ex vivo cell
and gene therapies.

The branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway and high levels of BCAA transaminase
1 (BCAT1) have recently been associated with aggressiveness in several cancer
entities. However, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in this process remains largely 
uncertain. Here, by performing high-resolution proteomic analysis of human acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) stem-cell and non-stem-cell populations, we find the BCAA
pathway enriched and BCAT1 protein and transcripts overexpressed in leukaemia
stem cells. We show that BCAT1, which transfers α-amino groups from BCAAs to
α-ketoglutarate (αKG), is a critical regulator of intracellular αKG homeostasis. 
Further to its role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, αKG is an essential cofactor
for αKG-dependent dioxygenases such as Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 1
(EGLN1) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA demethylases.
Knockdown of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells caused accumulation of αKG, leading to
EGLN1-mediated HIF1α protein degradation. This resulted in a growth and survival 
defect and abrogated leukaemia-initiating potential. By contrast, overexpression 
of BCAT1 in leukaemia cells decreased intracellular αKG levels and caused DNA
hypermethylation through altered TET activity. AML with high levels of BCAT1
(BCAT1high) displayed a DNA hypermethylation phenotype similar to cases carrying 
a mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHmut), in which TET2 is inhibited by the
oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. High levels of BCAT1 strongly correlate with
shorter overall survival in IDHWTTET2WT, but not IDHmut or TET2mut AML. Gene sets
characteristic for IDHmut AML were enriched in samples from patients with an
IDHWTTET2WTBCAT1high status. BCAT1high AML showed robust enrichment for leukaemia
stem-cell signatures, and paired sample analysis showed a significant increase in
BCAT1 levels upon disease relapse. In summary, by limiting intracellular αKG,
BCAT1 links BCAA catabolism to HIF1α stability and regulation of the epigenomic
landscape, mimicking the effects of IDH mutations. Our results suggest the
BCAA-BCAT1-αKG pathway as a therapeutic target to compromise leukaemia stem-cell 
function in patients with IDHWTTET2WT AML.

Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses: filamentous, enveloped viruses that
cause haemorrhagic fever. Filoviruses are within the order Mononegavirales, which
also includes rabies virus, measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus.
Mononegaviruses have non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genomes
that are encapsidated by nucleoprotein and other viral proteins to form a helical
nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid acts as a scaffold for virus assembly and as a
template for genome transcription and replication. Insights into
nucleoprotein-nucleoprotein interactions have been derived from structural
studies of oligomerized, RNA-encapsidating nucleoprotein, and cryo-electron
microscopy of nucleocapsid or nucleocapsid-like structures. There have been no
high-resolution reconstructions of complete mononegavirus nucleocapsids. Here we 
apply cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the
structure of Ebola virus nucleocapsid within intact viruses and recombinant
nucleocapsid-like assemblies. These structures reveal the identity and
arrangement of the nucleocapsid components, and suggest that the formation of an 
extended α-helix from the disordered carboxy-terminal region of
nucleoprotein-core links nucleoprotein oligomerization, nucleocapsid
condensation, RNA encapsidation, and accessory protein recruitment.

Scattering is used to probe matter and its interactions in all areas of physics. 
In ultracold atomic gases, control over pairwise interactions enables us to
investigate scattering in quantum many-body systems. Previous experiments on
colliding Bose-Einstein condensates have revealed matter-wave interference,
haloes of scattered atoms, four-wave mixing and correlations between
counter-propagating pairs. However, a regime with strong stimulation of
spontaneous collisions analogous to superradiance has proved elusive. In this
regime, the collisions rapidly produce highly correlated states with macroscopic 
population. Here we find that runaway stimulated collisions in Bose-Einstein
condensates with periodically modulated interaction strength cause the collective
emission of matter-wave jets that resemble fireworks. Jets appear only above a
threshold modulation amplitude and their correlations are invariant even when the
number of ejected atoms grows exponentially. Hence, we show that the structures
and atom occupancies of the jets stem from the quantum fluctuations of the
condensate. Our findings demonstrate the conditions required for runaway
stimulated collisions and reveal the quantum nature of matter-wave emission.

Granular materials such as sand, powders and foams are ubiquitous in daily life
and in industrial and geotechnical applications. These disordered systems form
stable structures when unperturbed, but in the presence of external influences
such as tapping or shear they 'relax', becoming fluid in nature. It is often
assumed that the relaxation dynamics of granular systems is similar to that of
thermal glass-forming systems. However, so far it has not been possible to
determine experimentally the dynamic properties of three-dimensional granular
systems at the particle level. This lack of experimental data, combined with the 
fact that the motion of granular particles involves friction (whereas the motion 
of particles in thermal glass-forming systems does not), means that an accurate
description of the relaxation dynamics of granular materials is lacking. Here we 
use X-ray tomography to determine the microscale relaxation dynamics of hard
granular ellipsoids subject to an oscillatory shear. We find that the
distribution of the displacements of the ellipsoids is well described by a Gumbel
law (which is similar to a Gaussian distribution for small displacements but has 
a heavier tail for larger displacements), with a shape parameter that is
independent of the amplitude of the shear strain and of the time. Despite this
universality, the mean squared displacement of an individual ellipsoid follows a 
power law as a function of time, with an exponent that does depend on the strain 
amplitude and time. We argue that these results are related to microscale
relaxation mechanisms that involve friction and memory effects (whereby the
motion of an ellipsoid at a given point in time depends on its previous motion). 
Our observations demonstrate that, at the particle level, the dynamic behaviour
of granular systems is qualitatively different from that of thermal glass-forming
systems, and is instead more similar to that of complex fluids. We conclude that 
granular materials can relax even when the driving strain is weak.

Halting global biodiversity loss is central to the Convention on Biological
Diversity and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, but success to date
has been very limited. A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals
is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity; however,
financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely
impact of any conservation investment. For greater effectiveness, we need an
evidence-based model that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces 
the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically 
quantify how conservation investment reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries
(signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Sustainable
Development Goals), by a median average of 29% per country between 1996 and 2008.
We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted
with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation 
investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human
development pressures). Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the
improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various
scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any 
chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human
development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over 
time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the Sustainable Development 
Goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the
dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development 
proceeds.

Locomotion is a universal behaviour that provides animals with the ability to
move between places. Classical experiments have used electrical microstimulation 
to identify brain regions that promote locomotion, but the identity of neurons
that act as key intermediaries between higher motor planning centres and
executive circuits in the spinal cord has remained controversial. Here we show
that the mouse caudal brainstem encompasses functionally heterogeneous neuronal
subpopulations that have differential effects on locomotion. These subpopulations
are distinguishable by location, neurotransmitter identity and connectivity.
Notably, glutamatergic neurons within the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus
(LPGi), a small subregion in the caudal brainstem, are essential to support
high-speed locomotion, and can positively tune locomotor speed through inputs
from glutamatergic neurons of the upstream midbrain locomotor region. By
contrast, glycinergic inhibitory neurons can induce different forms of
behavioural arrest mapping onto distinct caudal brainstem regions. Anatomically, 
descending pathways of glutamatergic and glycinergic LPGi subpopulations
communicate with distinct effector circuits in the spinal cord. Our results
reveal that behaviourally opposing locomotor functions in the caudal brainstem
were historically masked by the unexposed diversity of intermingled neuronal
subpopulations. We demonstrate how specific brainstem neuron populations
represent essential substrates to implement key parameters in the execution of
motor programs.

This Review highlights how we can build upon the relatively new and rapidly
developing field of research into bacterial quorum sensing (QS). We now have a
depth of knowledge about how bacteria use QS signals to communicate with each
other and to coordinate their activities. In recent years there have been
extraordinary advances in our understanding of the genetics, genomics,
biochemistry, and signal diversity of QS. We are beginning to understand the
connections between QS and bacterial sociality. This foundation places us at the 
beginning of a new era in which researchers will be able to work towards new
medicines to treat devastating infectious diseases, and use bacteria to
understand the biology of sociality.

Pluto's atmosphere is cold and hazy. Recent observations have shown it to be much
colder than predicted theoretically, suggesting an unknown cooling mechanism.
Atmospheric gas molecules, particularly water vapour, have been proposed as a
coolant; however, because Pluto's thermal structure is expected to be in
radiative-conductive equilibrium, the required water vapour would need to be
supersaturated by many orders of magnitude under thermodynamic equilibrium
conditions. Here we report that atmospheric hazes, rather than gases, can explain
Pluto's temperature profile. We find that haze particles have substantially
larger solar heating and thermal cooling rates than gas molecules, dominating the
atmospheric radiative balance from the ground to an altitude of 700 kilometres,
above which heat conduction maintains an isothermal atmosphere. We conclude that 
Pluto's atmosphere is unique among Solar System planetary atmospheres, as its
radiative energy equilibrium is controlled primarily by haze particles instead of
gas molecules. We predict that Pluto is therefore several orders of magnitude
brighter at mid-infrared wavelengths than previously thought-a brightness that
could be detected by future telescopes.

Earth's body tide-also known as the solid Earth tide, the displacement of the
solid Earth's surface caused by gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun-is
sensitive to the density of the two Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs)
beneath Africa and the Pacific. These massive regions extend approximately 1,000 
kilometres upward from the base of the mantle and their buoyancy remains actively
debated within the geophysical community. Here we use tidal tomography to
constrain Earth's deep-mantle buoyancy derived from Global Positioning System
(GPS)-based measurements of semi-diurnal body tide deformation. Using a
probabilistic approach, we show that across the bottom two-thirds of the two
LLSVPs the mean density is about 0.5 per cent higher than the average mantle
density across this depth range (that is, its mean buoyancy is minus 0.5 per
cent), although this anomaly may be concentrated towards the very base of the
mantle. We conclude that the buoyancy of these structures is dominated by the
enrichment of high-density chemical components, probably related to subducted
oceanic plates or primordial material associated with Earth's formation. Because 
the dynamics of the mantle is driven by density variations, our result has
important dynamical implications for the stability of the LLSVPs and the
long-term evolution of the Earth system.

History-independent cyclic response of nanotwinned metals.

Nearly 90 per cent of service failures of metallic components and structures are 
caused by fatigue at cyclic stress amplitudes much lower than the tensile
strength of the materials involved. Metals typically suffer from large amounts of
cumulative, irreversible damage to microstructure during cyclic deformation,
leading to cyclic responses that are unstable (hardening or softening) and
history-dependent. Existing rules for fatigue life prediction, such as the linear
cumulative damage rule, cannot account for the effect of loading history, and
engineering components are often loaded by complex cyclic stresses with variable 
amplitudes, mean values and frequencies, such as aircraft wings in turbulent air.
It is therefore usually extremely challenging to predict cyclic behaviour and
fatigue life under a realistic load spectrum. Here, through both atomistic
simulations and variable-strain-amplitude cyclic loading experiments at stress
amplitudes lower than the tensile strength of the metal, we report a
history-independent and stable cyclic response in bulk copper samples that
contain highly oriented nanoscale twins. We demonstrate that this unusual cyclic 
behaviour is governed by a type of correlated 'necklace' dislocation consisting
of multiple short component dislocations in adjacent twins, connected like the
links of a necklace. Such dislocations are formed in the highly oriented
nanotwinned structure under cyclic loading and help to maintain the stability of 
twin boundaries and the reversible damage, provided that the nanotwins are tilted
within about 15 degrees of the loading axis. This cyclic deformation mechanism is
distinct from the conventional strain localizing mechanisms associated with
irreversible microstructural damage in single-crystal, coarse-grained,
ultrafine-grained and nanograined metals.

For the initiation of transcription, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) assembles with
general transcription factors on promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex 
(PIC). Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae PIC and PIC-core Mediator complex at nominal resolutions of 4.7 Å and 
5.8 Å, respectively. The structures reveal transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), and 
suggest how the core and kinase TFIIH modules function in the opening of promoter
DNA and the phosphorylation of Pol II, respectively. The TFIIH core subunit Ssl2 
(a homologue of human XPB) is positioned on downstream DNA by the 'E-bridge'
helix in TFIIE, consistent with TFIIE-stimulated DNA opening. The TFIIH kinase
module subunit Tfb3 (MAT1 in human) anchors the kinase Kin28 (CDK7), which is
mobile in the PIC but preferentially located between the Mediator hook and
shoulder in the PIC-core Mediator complex. Open spaces between the Mediator head 
and middle modules may allow access of the kinase to its substrate, the
C-terminal domain of Pol II.

Both language and genes evolve by transmission over generations with opportunity 
for differential replication of forms. The understanding that gene frequencies
change at random by genetic drift, even in the absence of natural selection, was 
a seminal advance in evolutionary biology. Stochastic drift must also occur in
language as a result of randomness in how linguistic forms are copied between
speakers. Here we quantify the strength of selection relative to stochastic drift
in language evolution. We use time series derived from large corpora of annotated
texts dating from the 12th to 21st centuries to analyse three well-known
grammatical changes in English: the regularization of past-tense verbs, the
introduction of the periphrastic 'do', and variation in verbal negation. We
reject stochastic drift in favour of selection in some cases but not in others.
In particular, we infer selection towards the irregular forms of some past-tense 
verbs, which is likely driven by changing frequencies of rhyming patterns over
time. We show that stochastic drift is stronger for rare words, which may explain
why rare forms are more prone to replacement than common ones. This work provides
a method for testing selective theories of language change against a null model
and reveals an underappreciated role for stochasticity in language evolution.

Acquired drug resistance prevents cancer therapies from achieving stable and
complete responses. Emerging evidence implicates a key role for non-mutational
drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer 'persister'
cells. The persister cell pool constitutes a reservoir from which drug-resistant 
tumours may emerge. Targeting persister cells therefore presents a therapeutic
opportunity to impede tumour relapse. We previously found that cancer cells in a 
high mesenchymal therapy-resistant cell state are dependent on the lipid
hydroperoxidase GPX4 for survival. Here we show that a similar therapy-resistant 
cell state underlies the behaviour of persister cells derived from a wide range
of cancers and drug treatments. Consequently, we demonstrate that persister cells
acquire a dependency on GPX4. Loss of GPX4 function results in selective
persister cell ferroptotic death in vitro and prevents tumour relapse in mice.
These findings suggest that targeting of GPX4 may represent a therapeutic
strategy to prevent acquired drug resistance.

Forest edges influence more than half of the world's forests and contribute to
worldwide declines in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, predicting
these declines is challenging in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes. Here we
assembled a global dataset on species responses to fragmentation and developed a 
statistical approach for quantifying edge impacts in heterogeneous landscapes to 
quantify edge-determined changes in abundance of 1,673 vertebrate species. We
show that the abundances of 85% of species are affected, either positively or
negatively, by forest edges. Species that live in the centre of the forest
(forest core), that were more likely to be listed as threatened by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reached peak abundances
only at sites farther than 200-400 m from sharp high-contrast forest edges.
Smaller-bodied amphibians, larger reptiles and medium-sized non-volant mammals
experienced a larger reduction in suitable habitat than other forest-core
species. Our results highlight the pervasive ability of forest edges to
restructure ecological communities on a global scale.

Copy-number variants of chromosome 16 region 16p11.2 are linked to
neuropsychiatric disorders and are among the most prevalent in autism spectrum
disorders. Of many 16p11.2 genes, Kctd13 has been implicated as a major driver of
neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The function of KCTD13 in the mammalian brain,
however, remains unknown. Here we delete the Kctd13 gene in mice and demonstrate 
reduced synaptic transmission. Reduced synaptic transmission correlates with
increased levels of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), a KCTD13/CUL3
ubiquitin ligase substrate, and is reversed by RhoA inhibition, suggesting
increased RhoA as an important mechanism. In contrast to a previous knockdown
study, deletion of Kctd13 or kctd13 does not increase brain size or neurogenesis 
in mice or zebrafish, respectively. These findings implicate Kctd13 in the
regulation of neuronal function relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders and
clarify the role of Kctd13 in neurogenesis and brain size. Our data also reveal a
potential role for RhoA as a therapeutic target in disorders associated with
KCTD13 deletion.

Nutrient limitation of oceanic primary production exerts a fundamental control on
marine food webs and the flux of carbon into the deep ocean. The extensive
boundaries of the oligotrophic sub-tropical gyres collectively define the most
extreme transition in ocean productivity, but little is known about nutrient
limitation in these zones. Here we present the results of full-factorial nutrient
amendment experiments conducted at the eastern boundary of the South Atlantic
gyre. We find extensive regions in which the addition of nitrogen or iron
individually resulted in no significant phytoplankton growth over 48 hours.
However, the addition of both nitrogen and iron increased concentrations of
chlorophyll a by up to approximately 40-fold, led to diatom proliferation, and
reduced community diversity. Once nitrogen-iron co-limitation had been
alleviated, the addition of cobalt or cobalt-containing vitamin B12 could further
enhance chlorophyll a yields by up to threefold. Our results suggest that
nitrogen-iron co-limitation is pervasive in the ocean, with other micronutrients 
also approaching co-deficiency. Such multi-nutrient limitations potentially
increase phytoplankton community diversity.

Modifications on mRNA offer the potential of regulating mRNA fate
post-transcriptionally. Recent studies suggested the widespread presence of
N1-methyladenosine (m1A), which disrupts Watson-Crick base pairing, at internal
sites of mRNAs. These studies lacked the resolution of identifying individual
modified bases, and did not identify specific sequence motifs undergoing the
modification or an enzymatic machinery catalysing them, rendering it challenging 
to validate and functionally characterize putative sites. Here we develop an
approach that allows the transcriptome-wide mapping of m1A at single-nucleotide
resolution. Within the cytosol, m1A is present in a low number of mRNAs,
typically at low stoichiometries, and almost invariably in tRNA T-loop-like
structures, where it is introduced by the TRMT6/TRMT61A complex. We identify a
single m1A site in the mitochondrial ND5 mRNA, catalysed by TRMT10C, with
methylation levels that are highly tissue specific and tightly developmentally
controlled. m1A leads to translational repression, probably through a mechanism
involving ribosomal scanning or translation. Our findings suggest that m1A on
mRNA, probably because of its disruptive impact on base pairing, leads to
translational repression, and is generally avoided by cells, while revealing one 
case in mitochondria where tight spatiotemporal control over m1A levels was
adopted as a potential means of post-transcriptional regulation.

Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large
neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep
structures. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent
spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen
neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging offers more coverage but lacks the
temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not
measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in
unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large
volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as 
Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can
programmably address 960 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
processing-compatible low-impedance TiN sites that tile a single 10-mm long,
70 × 20-μm cross-section shank. The 6 × 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the
shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and 
digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital
data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel
count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe
implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single 
neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake
mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes
allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded
in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode
technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording
of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.

Astrocytes are complex glial cells with numerous fine cellular processes that
infiltrate the neuropil and interact with synapses. The mechanisms that control
the establishment of astrocyte morphology are unknown, and it is unclear whether 
impairing astrocytic infiltration of the neuropil alters synaptic connectivity.
Here we show that astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse cortex depends on direct
contact with neuronal processes and occurs in parallel with the growth and
activity of synaptic circuits. The neuroligin family cell adhesion proteins NL1, 
NL2, and NL3, which are expressed by cortical astrocytes, control astrocyte
morphogenesis through interactions with neuronal neurexins. Furthermore, in the
absence of astrocytic NL2, the formation and function of cortical excitatory
synapses are diminished, whereas inhibitory synaptic function is enhanced. Our
findings highlight a previously undescribed mechanism of action for neuroligins
and link astrocyte morphogenesis to synaptogenesis. Because neuroligin mutations 
have been implicated in various neurological disorders, these findings also point
towards an astrocyte-based mechanism of neural pathology.

The freezing of water affects the processes that determine Earth's climate.
Therefore, accurate weather and climate forecasts hinge on good predictions of
ice nucleation rates. Such rate predictions are based on extrapolations using
classical nucleation theory, which assumes that the structure of nanometre-sized 
ice crystallites corresponds to that of hexagonal ice, the thermodynamically
stable form of bulk ice. However, simulations with various water models find that
ice nucleated and grown under atmospheric temperatures is at all sizes
stacking-disordered, consisting of random sequences of cubic and hexagonal ice
layers. This implies that stacking-disordered ice crystallites either are more
stable than hexagonal ice crystallites or form because of non-equilibrium
dynamical effects. Both scenarios challenge central tenets of classical
nucleation theory. Here we use rare-event sampling and free energy calculations
with the mW water model to show that the entropy of mixing cubic and hexagonal
layers makes stacking-disordered ice the stable phase for crystallites up to a
size of at least 100,000 molecules. We find that stacking-disordered critical
crystallites at 230 kelvin are about 14 kilojoules per mole of crystallite more
stable than hexagonal crystallites, making their ice nucleation rates more than
three orders of magnitude higher than predicted by classical nucleation theory.
This effect on nucleation rates is temperature dependent, being the most
pronounced at the warmest conditions, and should affect the modelling of cloud
formation and ice particle numbers, which are very sensitive to the temperature
dependence of ice nucleation rates. We conclude that classical nucleation theory 
needs to be corrected to include the dependence of the crystallization driving
force on the size of the ice crystallite when interpreting and extrapolating ice 
nucleation rates from experimental laboratory conditions to the temperatures that
occur in clouds.

Nervous systems combine lower-level sensory signals to detect higher-order
stimulus features critical to survival, such as the visual looming motion created
by an imminent collision or approaching predator. Looming-sensitive neurons have 
been identified in diverse animal species. Different large-scale visual features 
such as looming often share local cues, which means loom-detecting neurons face
the challenge of rejecting confounding stimuli. Here we report the discovery of
an ultra-selective looming detecting neuron, lobula plate/lobula columnar, type
II (LPLC2) in Drosophila, and show how its selectivity is established by radial
motion opponency. In the fly visual system, directionally selective small-field
neurons called T4 and T5 form a spatial map in the lobula plate, where they each 
terminate in one of four retinotopic layers, such that each layer responds to
motion in a different cardinal direction. Single-cell anatomical analysis reveals
that each arm of the LPLC2 cross-shaped primary dendrites ramifies in one of
these layers and extends along that layer's preferred motion direction. In vivo
calcium imaging demonstrates that, as their shape predicts, individual LPLC2
neurons respond strongly to outward motion emanating from the centre of the
neuron's receptive field. Each dendritic arm also receives local inhibitory
inputs directionally selective for inward motion opposing the excitation. This
radial motion opponency generates a balance of excitation and inhibition that
makes LPLC2 non-responsive to related patterns of motion such as contraction,
wide-field rotation or luminance change. As a population, LPLC2 neurons densely
cover visual space and terminate onto the giant fibre descending neurons, which
drive the jump muscle motor neuron to trigger an escape take off. Our findings
provide a mechanistic description of the selective feature detection that flies
use to discern and escape looming threats.

Every supernova so far observed has been considered to be the terminal explosion 
of a star. Moreover, all supernovae with absorption lines in their spectra show
those lines decreasing in velocity over time, as the ejecta expand and thin,
revealing slower-moving material that was previously hidden. In addition, every
supernova that exhibits the absorption lines of hydrogen has one main light-curve
peak, or a plateau in luminosity, lasting approximately 100 days before
declining. Here we report observations of iPTF14hls, an event that has spectra
identical to a hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova, but characteristics that
differ extensively from those of known supernovae. The light curve has at least
five peaks and remains bright for more than 600 days; the absorption lines show
little to no decrease in velocity; and the radius of the line-forming region is
more than an order of magnitude bigger than the radius of the photosphere derived
from the continuum emission. These characteristics are consistent with a shell of
several tens of solar masses ejected by the progenitor star at supernova-level
energies a few hundred days before a terminal explosion. Another possible
eruption was recorded at the same position in 1954. Multiple energetic
pre-supernova eruptions are expected to occur in stars of 95 to 130 solar masses,
which experience the pulsational pair instability. That model, however, does not 
account for the continued presence of hydrogen, or the energetics observed here. 
Another mechanism for the violent ejection of mass in massive stars may be
required.

The abyssal ocean is broadly characterized by northward flow of the densest
waters and southward flow of less-dense waters above them. Understanding what
controls the strength and structure of these interhemispheric flows-referred to
as the abyssal overturning circulation-is key to quantifying the ocean's ability 
to store carbon and heat on timescales exceeding a century. Here we show that,
north of 32° S, the depth distribution of the seafloor compels dense
southern-origin waters to flow northward below a depth of about 4 kilometres and 
to return southward predominantly at depths greater than 2.5 kilometres. Unless
ventilated from the north, the overlying mid-depths (1 to 2.5 kilometres deep)
host comparatively weak mean meridional flow. Backed by analysis of historical
radiocarbon measurements, the findings imply that the geometry of the Pacific,
Indian and Atlantic basins places a major external constraint on the overturning 
structure.

The rate of behavioural decline in the ageing population is remarkably variable
among individuals. Despite the considerable interest in studying natural
variation in ageing rate to identify factors that control healthy ageing, no such
factor has yet been found. Here we report a genetic basis for variation in ageing
rates in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that C. elegans isolates show diverse
lifespan and age-related declines in virility, pharyngeal pumping, and
locomotion. DNA polymorphisms in a novel peptide-coding gene, named
regulatory-gene-for-behavioural-ageing-1 (rgba-1), and the neuropeptide receptor 
gene npr-28 influence the rate of age-related decline of worm mating behaviour;
these two genes might have been subjected to recent selective sweeps.
Glia-derived RGBA-1 activates NPR-28 signalling, which acts in serotonergic and
dopaminergic neurons to accelerate behavioural deterioration. This signalling
involves the SIR-2.1-dependent activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein
response, a pathway that modulates ageing. Thus, natural variation in
neuropeptide-mediated glia-neuron signalling modulates the rate of ageing in C.
elegans.

Imaging and chromosome conformation capture studies have revealed several layers 
of chromosome organization, including segregation into megabase-sized active and 
inactive compartments, and partitioning into sub-megabase domains (TADs). It
remains unclear, however, how these layers of organization form, interact with
one another and influence genome function. Here we show that deletion of the
cohesin-loading factor Nipbl in mouse liver leads to a marked reorganization of
chromosomal folding. TADs and associated Hi-C peaks vanish globally, even in the 
absence of transcriptional changes. By contrast, compartmental segregation is
preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a
finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic
landscape. These observations demonstrate that the three-dimensional organization
of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms:
cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments,
defined by chromatin state; and cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by 
loop extrusion, which helps to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.

Pathogens have to balance transmission with persistence. For Plasmodium
falciparum, the most widespread and virulent malaria parasite, persistence within
its human host requires continuous asexual replication within red blood cells,
while its mosquito-borne transmission depends on intra-erythrocytic
differentiation into non-replicating sexual stages called gametocytes. Commitment
to either fate is determined during the preceding cell cycle that begins with
invasion by a single, asexually committed merozoite and ends, 48 hours later,
with a schizont releasing newly formed merozoites, all committed to either
continued asexual replication or differentiation into gametocytes. Sexual
commitment requires the transcriptional activation of ap2-g (PF3D7_1222600), the 
master regulator of sexual development, from an epigenetically silenced state
during asexual replication. AP2-G expression during this 'commitment cycle'
prepares gene expression in nascent merozoites to initiate sexual development
through a hitherto unknown mechanism. To maintain a persistent infection, the
expression of ap2-g is limited to a sub-population of parasites (1-30%, depending
on genetic background and growth conditions). As sexually committed schizonts
comprise only a sub-population and are morphologically indistinguishable from
their asexually committed counterparts, defining their characteristic gene
expression has been difficult using traditional, bulk transcriptome profiling.
Here we use highly parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing of malaria cultures
undergoing sexual commitment to determine the transcriptional changes induced by 
AP2-G within this sub-population. By analysing more than 18,000 single parasite
transcriptomes from a conditional AP2-G knockdown line and NF54 wild-type
parasites at multiple stages of development, we show that sexually committed,
AP2-G+ mature schizonts specifically upregulate additional regulators of gene
expression, including other AP2 transcription factors, histone-modifying enzymes,
and regulators of nucleosome positioning. These epigenetic regulators may act to 
facilitate the expression and/or repression of genes that are necessary for the
initiation of gametocyte development in the subsequent cell cycle.

On 17 August 2017, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed the
gravitational-wave event GW170817-a strong signal from the merger of a binary
neutron-star system. Less than two seconds after the merger, a γ-ray burst (GRB
170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the
LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source. This sky region was
subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities, resulting in the
identification of an optical transient signal within about ten arcseconds of the 
galaxy NGC 4993. This detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and
electromagnetic waves represents the first 'multi-messenger' astronomical
observation. Such observations enable GW170817 to be used as a 'standard siren'
(meaning that the absolute distance to the source can be determined directly from
the gravitational-wave measurements) to measure the Hubble constant. This
quantity represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall
scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Here we
report a measurement of the Hubble constant that combines the distance to the
source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession
velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using the electromagnetic
data. In contrast to previous measurements, ours does not require the use of a
cosmic 'distance ladder': the gravitational-wave analysis can be used to estimate
the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of
intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant
to be about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This value is consistent
with existing measurements, while being completely independent of them.
Additional standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources
will enable the Hubble constant to be constrained to high precision.

The merger of two neutron stars is predicted to give rise to three major
detectable phenomena: a short burst of γ-rays, a gravitational-wave signal, and a
transient optical-near-infrared source powered by the synthesis of large amounts 
of very heavy elements via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). Such
transients, named 'macronovae' or 'kilonovae', are believed to be centres of
production of rare elements such as gold and platinum. The most compelling
evidence so far for a kilonova was a very faint near-infrared rebrightening in
the afterglow of a short γ-ray burst at redshift z = 0.356, although findings
indicating bluer events have been reported. Here we report the spectral
identification and describe the physical properties of a bright kilonova
associated with the gravitational-wave source GW170817 and γ-ray burst GRB
170817A associated with a galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs from Earth.
Using a series of spectra from ground-based observatories covering the wavelength
range from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we find that the kilonova is
characterized by rapidly expanding ejecta with spectral features similar to those
predicted by current models. The ejecta is optically thick early on, with a
velocity of about 0.2 times light speed, and reaches a radius of about 50
astronomical units in only 1.5 days. As the ejecta expands, broad absorption-like
lines appear on the spectral continuum, indicating atomic species produced by
nucleosynthesis that occurs in the post-merger fast-moving dynamical ejecta and
in two slower (0.05 times light speed) wind regions. Comparison with spectral
models suggests that the merger ejected 0.03 to 0.05 solar masses of material,
including high-opacity lanthanides.

Gravitational waves were discovered with the detection of binary black-hole
mergers and they should also be detectable from lower-mass neutron-star mergers. 
These are predicted to eject material rich in heavy radioactive isotopes that can
power an electromagnetic signal. This signal is luminous at optical and infrared 
wavelengths and is called a kilonova. The gravitational-wave source GW170817
arose from a binary neutron-star merger in the nearby Universe with a relatively 
well confined sky position and distance estimate. Here we report observations and
physical modelling of a rapidly fading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy
NGC 4993, which is spatially coincident with GW170817 and with a weak, short
γ-ray burst. The transient has physical parameters that broadly match the
theoretical predictions of blue kilonovae from neutron-star mergers. The emitted 
electromagnetic radiation can be explained with an ejected mass of 0.04 ± 0.01
solar masses, with an opacity of less than 0.5 square centimetres per gram, at a 
velocity of 0.2 ± 0.1 times light speed. The power source is constrained to have 
a power-law slope of -1.2 ± 0.3, consistent with radioactive powering from
r-process nuclides. (The r-process is a series of neutron capture reactions that 
synthesise many of the elements heavier than iron.) We identify line features in 
the spectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (atomic masses of
90-140). As it fades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and a higher-opacity,
lanthanide-rich ejecta component may contribute to the emission. This indicates
that neutron-star mergers produce gravitational waves and radioactively powered
kilonovae, and are a nucleosynthetic source of the r-process elements.

The cosmic origin of elements heavier than iron has long been uncertain.
Theoretical modelling shows that the matter that is expelled in the violent
merger of two neutron stars can assemble into heavy elements such as gold and
platinum in a process known as rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis.
The radioactive decay of isotopes of the heavy elements is predicted to power a
distinctive thermal glow (a 'kilonova'). The discovery of an electromagnetic
counterpart to the gravitational-wave source GW170817 represents the first
opportunity to detect and scrutinize a sample of freshly synthesized r-process
elements. Here we report models that predict the electromagnetic emission of
kilonovae in detail and enable the mass, velocity and composition of ejecta to be
derived from observations. We compare the models to the optical and infrared
radiation associated with the GW170817 event to argue that the observed source is
a kilonova. We infer the presence of two distinct components of ejecta, one
composed primarily of light (atomic mass number less than 140) and one of heavy
(atomic mass number greater than 140) r-process elements. The ejected mass and a 
merger rate inferred from GW170817 imply that such mergers are a dominant mode of
r-process production in the Universe.

A grand challenge of systems biology is to predict the kinetic responses of
living systems to perturbations starting from the underlying molecular
interactions. Changes in the nutrient environment have long been used to study
regulation and adaptation phenomena in microorganisms and they remain a topic of 
active investigation. Although much is known about the molecular interactions
that govern the regulation of key metabolic processes in response to applied
perturbations, they are insufficiently quantified for predictive bottom-up
modelling. Here we develop a top-down approach, expanding the recently
established coarse-grained proteome allocation models from steady-state growth
into the kinetic regime. Using only qualitative knowledge of the underlying
regulatory processes and imposing the condition of flux balance, we derive a
quantitative model of bacterial growth transitions that is independent of
inaccessible kinetic parameters. The resulting flux-controlled regulation model
accurately predicts the time course of gene expression and biomass accumulation
in response to carbon upshifts and downshifts (for example, diauxic shifts)
without adjustable parameters. As predicted by the model and validated by
quantitative proteomics, cells exhibit suboptimal recovery kinetics in response
to nutrient shifts owing to a rigid strategy of protein synthesis allocation,
which is not directed towards alleviating specific metabolic bottlenecks. Our
approach does not rely on kinetic parameters, and therefore points to a
theoretical framework for describing a broad range of such kinetic processes
without detailed knowledge of the underlying biochemical reactions.

T helper 17 (TH17) cells are critically involved in host defence, inflammation,
and autoimmunity. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is instrumental in TH17
cell differentiation by cooperating with interleukin-6 (refs 6, 7). Yet, the
mechanism by which TGFβ enables TH17 cell differentiation remains elusive. Here
we reveal that TGFβ enables TH17 cell differentiation by reversing
SKI-SMAD4-mediated suppression of the expression of the retinoic acid receptor
(RAR)-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt). We found that, unlike wild-type T
cells, SMAD4-deficient T cells differentiate into TH17 cells in the absence of
TGFβ signalling in a RORγt-dependent manner. Ectopic SMAD4 expression suppresses 
RORγt expression and TH17 cell differentiation of SMAD4-deficient T cells.
However, TGFβ neutralizes SMAD4-mediated suppression without affecting SMAD4
binding to the Rorc locus. Proteomic analysis revealed that SMAD4 interacts with 
SKI, a transcriptional repressor that is degraded upon TGFβ stimulation. SKI
controls histone acetylation and deacetylation of the Rorc locus and TH17 cell
differentiation via SMAD4: ectopic SKI expression inhibits H3K9 acetylation of
the Rorc locus, Rorc expression, and TH17 cell differentiation in a
SMAD4-dependent manner. Therefore, TGFβ-induced disruption of SKI reverses
SKI-SMAD4-mediated suppression of RORγt to enable TH17 cell differentiation. This
study reveals a critical mechanism by which TGFβ controls TH17 cell

Epigenetic modifications, including chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, 
have a central role in the regulation of gene expression in plants and animals.
The transmission of epigenetic marks is crucial for certain genes to retain cell 
lineage-specific expression patterns and maintain cell fate. However, the marks
that have accumulated at regulatory loci during growth and development or in
response to environmental stimuli need to be deleted in gametes or embryos,
particularly in organisms such as plants that do not set aside a germ line, to
ensure the proper development of offspring. In Arabidopsis thaliana, prolonged
exposure to cold temperatures (winter cold), in a process known as vernalization,
triggers the mitotically stable epigenetic silencing of the potent floral
repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), and renders plants competent to flower in the 
spring; however, this silencing is reset during each generation. Here we show
that the seed-specific transcription factor LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) promotes the 
initial establishment of an active chromatin state at FLC and activates its
expression de novo in the pro-embryo, thus reversing the silenced state inherited
from gametes. This active chromatin state is passed on from the pro-embryo to
post-embryonic life, and leads to transmission of the embryonic memory of FLC
activation to post-embryonic stages. Our findings reveal a mechanism for the
reprogramming of embryonic chromatin states in plants, and provide insights into 
the epigenetic memory of embryonic active gene expression in post-embryonic
phases, through which an embryonic factor acts to 'control' post-embryonic
development processes that are distinct from embryogenesis in plants.

Direct lineage conversion offers a new strategy for tissue regeneration and
disease modelling. Despite recent success in directly reprogramming fibroblasts
into various cell types, the precise changes that occur as fibroblasts
progressively convert to the target cell fates remain unclear. The inherent
heterogeneity and asynchronous nature of the reprogramming process renders it
difficult to study this process using bulk genomic techniques. Here we used
single-cell RNA sequencing to overcome this limitation and analysed global
transcriptome changes at early stages during the reprogramming of mouse
fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs). Using unsupervised dimensionality
reduction and clustering algorithms, we identified molecularly distinct
subpopulations of cells during reprogramming. We also constructed routes of iCM
formation, and delineated the relationship between cell proliferation and iCM
induction. Further analysis of global gene expression changes during
reprogramming revealed unexpected downregulation of factors involved in mRNA
processing and splicing. Detailed functional analysis of the top candidate
splicing factor, Ptbp1, revealed that it is a critical barrier for the
acquisition of cardiomyocyte-specific splicing patterns in fibroblasts.
Concomitantly, Ptbp1 depletion promoted cardiac transcriptome acquisition and
increased iCM reprogramming efficiency. Additional quantitative analysis of our
dataset revealed a strong correlation between the expression of each
reprogramming factor and the progress of individual cells through the
reprogramming process, and led to the discovery of new surface markers for the
enrichment of iCMs. In summary, our single-cell transcriptomics approaches
enabled us to reconstruct the reprogramming trajectory and to uncover
intermediate cell populations, gene pathways and regulators involved in iCM
induction.

Interleukin-1 receptor 8 (IL-1R8, also known as single immunoglobulin
IL-1R-related receptor, SIGIRR, or TIR8) is a member of the IL-1 receptor (ILR)
family with distinct structural and functional characteristics, acting as a
negative regulator of ILR and Toll-like receptor (TLR) downstream signalling
pathways and inflammation. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells
which mediate resistance against pathogens and contribute to the activation and
orientation of adaptive immune responses. NK cells mediate resistance against
haematopoietic neoplasms but are generally considered to play a minor role in
solid tumour carcinogenesis. Here we report that IL-1R8 serves as a checkpoint
for NK cell maturation and effector function. Its genetic blockade unleashes
NK-cell-mediated resistance to hepatic carcinogenesis, haematogenous liver and
lung metastasis, and cytomegalovirus infection.

Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes,
such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly non-coding variants. However, much of the 
genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the
results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 
105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of
East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall
breast cancer risk at P < 5 × 10-8. The majority of credible risk
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements,
and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each
locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic
driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer
due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was 2-5-fold
enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for
particular transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further
insight into genetic susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of 
genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention.

Mammalian tissues are fuelled by circulating nutrients, including glucose, amino 
acids, and various intermediary metabolites. Under aerobic conditions, glucose is
generally assumed to be burned fully by tissues via the tricarboxylic acid cycle 
(TCA cycle) to carbon dioxide. Alternatively, glucose can be catabolized
anaerobically via glycolysis to lactate, which is itself also a potential
nutrient for tissues and tumours. The quantitative relevance of circulating
lactate or other metabolic intermediates as fuels remains unclear. Here we
systematically examine the fluxes of circulating metabolites in mice, and find
that lactate can be a primary source of carbon for the TCA cycle and thus of
energy. Intravenous infusions of 13C-labelled nutrients reveal that, on a molar
basis, the circulatory turnover flux of lactate is the highest of all metabolites
and exceeds that of glucose by 1.1-fold in fed mice and 2.5-fold in fasting mice;
lactate is made primarily from glucose but also from other sources. In both fed
and fasted mice, 13C-lactate extensively labels TCA cycle intermediates in all
tissues. Quantitative analysis reveals that during the fasted state, the
contribution of glucose to tissue TCA metabolism is primarily indirect (via
circulating lactate) in all tissues except the brain. In genetically engineered
lung and pancreatic cancer tumours in fasted mice, the contribution of
circulating lactate to TCA cycle intermediates exceeds that of glucose, with
glutamine making a larger contribution than lactate in pancreatic cancer. Thus,
glycolysis and the TCA cycle are uncoupled at the level of lactate, which is a
primary circulating TCA substrate in most tissues and tumours.

Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis for its conversion of solar energy to
chemical energy. Photosynthetic organisms have developed a variety of
light-harvesting systems to capture sunlight. The largest light-harvesting
complex is the phycobilisome (PBS), the main light-harvesting antenna in
cyanobacteria and red algae. It is composed of phycobiliproteins and linker
proteins but the assembly mechanisms and energy transfer pathways of the PBS are 
not well understood. Here we report the structure of a 16.8-megadalton PBS from a
red alga at 3.5 Å resolution obtained by single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy. We modelled 862 protein subunits, including 4 linkers in the core, 16
rod-core linkers and 52 rod linkers, and located a total of 2,048 chromophores.
This structure reveals the mechanisms underlying specific interactions between
linkers and phycobiliproteins, and the formation of linker skeletons. These
results provide a firm structural basis for our understanding of complex assembly
and the mechanisms of energy transfer within the PBS.

The outcomes of evolution are determined by a stochastic dynamical process that
governs how mutations arise and spread through a population. However, it is
difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire 
genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve
experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic
sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand
generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular
evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the
duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously
competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and
evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable
coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues
within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection
change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of
selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term
adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process
than is often assumed.

The essence of nuclear fusion is that energy can be released by the rearrangement
of nucleons between the initial- and final-state nuclei. The recent discovery of 
the first doubly charmed baryon , which contains two charm quarks (c) and one up 
quark (u) and has a mass of about 3,621 megaelectronvolts (MeV) (the mass of the 
proton is 938 MeV) also revealed a large binding energy of about 130 MeV between 
the two charm quarks. Here we report that this strong binding enables a
quark-rearrangement, exothermic reaction in which two heavy baryons (Λc) undergo 
fusion to produce the doubly charmed baryon and a neutron n (), resulting in an
energy release of 12 MeV. This reaction is a quark-level analogue of the
deuterium-tritium nuclear fusion reaction (DT → 4He n). The much larger binding
energy (approximately 280 MeV) between two bottom quarks (b) causes the analogous
reaction with bottom quarks () to have a much larger energy release of about 138 
MeV. We suggest some experimental setups in which the highly exothermic nature of
the fusion of two heavy-quark baryons might manifest itself. At present, however,
the very short lifetimes of the heavy bottom and charm quarks preclude any
practical applications of such reactions.

Ecological interactions have been acknowledged to play a key role in shaping
biodiversity. Yet a major challenge for evolutionary biology is to understand the
role of ecological interactions in shaping trait evolution when progressing from 
pairs of interacting species to multispecies interaction networks. Here we
introduce an approach that integrates coevolutionary dynamics and network
structure. Our results show that non-interacting species can be as important as
directly interacting species in shaping coevolution within mutualistic
assemblages. The contribution of indirect effects differs among types of
mutualism. Indirect effects are more likely to predominate in nested,
species-rich networks formed by multiple-partner mutualisms, such as pollination 
or seed dispersal by animals, than in small and modular networks formed by
intimate mutualisms, such as those between host plants and their protective ants.
Coevolutionary pathways of indirect effects favour ongoing trait evolution by
promoting slow but continuous reorganization of the adaptive landscape of
mutualistic partners under changing environments. Our results show that
coevolution can be a major process shaping species traits throughout ecological
networks. These findings expand our understanding of how evolution driven by
interactions occurs through the interplay of selection pressures moving along
multiple direct and indirect pathways.

G-protein-coupled receptors mediate the biological effects of many hormones and
neurotransmitters and are important pharmacological targets. They transmit their 
signals to the cell interior by interacting with G proteins. However, it is
unclear how receptors and G proteins meet, interact and couple. Here we analyse
the concerted motion of G-protein-coupled receptors and G proteins on the plasma 
membrane and provide a quantitative model that reveals the key factors that
underlie the high spatiotemporal complexity of their interactions. Using
two-colour, single-molecule imaging we visualize interactions between individual 
receptors and G proteins at the surface of living cells. Under basal conditions, 
receptors and G proteins form activity-dependent complexes that last for around
one second. Agonists specifically regulate the kinetics of receptor-G protein
interactions, mainly by increasing their association rate. We find hot spots on
the plasma membrane, at least partially defined by the cytoskeleton and
clathrin-coated pits, in which receptors and G proteins are confined and
preferentially couple. Imaging with the nanobody Nb37 suggests that signalling by
G-protein-coupled receptors occurs preferentially at these hot spots. These
findings shed new light on the dynamic interactions that control
G-protein-coupled receptor signalling.

Recent studies on the controllability of complex systems offer a powerful
mathematical framework to systematically explore the structure-function
relationship in biological, social, and technological networks. Despite
theoretical advances, we lack direct experimental proof of the validity of these 
widely used control principles. Here we fill this gap by applying a control
framework to the connectome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, allowing us
to predict the involvement of each C. elegans neuron in locomotor behaviours. We 
predict that control of the muscles or motor neurons requires 12 neuronal
classes, which include neuronal groups previously implicated in locomotion by
laser ablation, as well as one previously uncharacterized neuron, PDB. We
validate this prediction experimentally, finding that the ablation of PDB leads
to a significant loss of dorsoventral polarity in large body bends. Importantly, 
control principles also allow us to investigate the involvement of individual
neurons within each neuronal class. For example, we predict that, within the
class of DD motor neurons, only three (DD04, DD05, or DD06) should affect
locomotion when ablated individually. This prediction is also confirmed; single
cell ablations of DD04 or DD05 specifically affect posterior body movements,
whereas ablations of DD02 or DD03 do not. Our predictions are robust to deletions
of weak connections, missing connections, and rewired connections in the current 
connectome, indicating the potential applicability of this analytical framework
to larger and less well-characterized connectomes.

Ubiquitination controls the stability of most cellular proteins, and its
deregulation contributes to human diseases including cancer. Deubiquitinases
remove ubiquitin from proteins, and their inhibition can induce the degradation
of selected proteins, potentially including otherwise 'undruggable' targets. For 
example, the inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) results in the
degradation of the oncogenic E3 ligase MDM2, and leads to re-activation of the
tumour suppressor p53 in various cancers. Here we report that two compounds,
FT671 and FT827, inhibit USP7 with high affinity and specificity in vitro and
within human cells. Co-crystal structures reveal that both compounds target a
dynamic pocket near the catalytic centre of the auto-inhibited apo form of USP7, 
which differs from other USP deubiquitinases. Consistent with USP7 target
engagement in cells, FT671 destabilizes USP7 substrates including MDM2, increases
levels of p53, and results in the transcription of p53 target genes, induction of
the tumour suppressor p21, and inhibition of tumour growth in mice.

The skin barrier is the body's first line of defence against environmental
assaults, and is maintained by epithelial stem cells (EpSCs). Despite the
vulnerability of EpSCs to inflammatory pressures, neither the primary response to
inflammation nor its enduring consequences are well understood. Here we report a 
prolonged memory to acute inflammation that enables mouse EpSCs to hasten barrier
restoration after subsequent tissue damage. This functional adaptation does not
require skin-resident macrophages or T cells. Instead, EpSCs maintain chromosomal
accessibility at key stress response genes that are activated by the primary
stimulus. Upon a secondary challenge, genes governed by these domains are
transcribed rapidly. Fuelling this memory is Aim2, which encodes an activator of 
the inflammasome. The absence of AIM2 or its downstream effectors, caspase-1 and 
interleukin-1β, erases the ability of EpSCs to recollect inflammation. Although
EpSCs benefit from inflammatory tuning by heightening their responsiveness to
subsequent stressors, this enhanced sensitivity probably increases their
susceptibility to autoimmune and hyperproliferative disorders, including cancer.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent signalling lipid secreted by red blood
cells and platelets, plays numerous biologically significant roles. However, the 
identity of its long-sought exporter is enigmatic. Here we show that the major
facilitator superfamily transporter 2b (Mfsd2b), an orphan transporter, is
essential for S1P export from red blood cells and platelets. Comprehensive
lipidomic analysis indicates a dramatic and specific accumulation of S1P species 
in Mfsd2b knockout red blood cells and platelets compared with that of wild-type 
controls. Consistently, biochemical assays from knockout red blood cells,
platelets, and cell lines overexpressing human and mouse Mfsd2b proteins
demonstrate that Mfsd2b actively exports S1P. Plasma S1P level in knockout mice
is significantly reduced by 42-54% of that of wild-type level, indicating that
Mfsd2b pathway contributes approximately half of the plasma S1P pool. The
reduction of plasma S1P in knockout mice is insufficient to cause blood vessel
leakiness, but it does render the mice more sensitive to anaphylactic shock.
Stress-induced erythropoiesis significantly increased plasma S1P levels and
knockout mice were sensitive to these treatments. Surprisingly, knockout mice
exhibited haemolysis associated with red blood cell stomatocytes, and the
haemolytic phenotype was severely increased with signs of membrane fragility
under stress erythropoiesis. We show that S1P secretion by Mfsd2b is critical for
red blood cell morphology. Our data reveal an unexpected physiological role of
red blood cells in sphingolipid metabolism in circulation. These findings open
new avenues for investigating the signalling roles of S1P derived from red blood 
cells and platelets.

The ubiquitin system regulates essential cellular processes in eukaryotes.
Ubiquitin is ligated to substrate proteins as monomers or chains and the topology
of ubiquitin modifications regulates substrate interactions with specific
proteins. Thus ubiquitination directs a variety of substrate fates including
proteasomal degradation. Deubiquitinase enzymes cleave ubiquitin from substrates 
and are implicated in disease; for example, ubiquitin-specific protease-7 (USP7) 
regulates stability of the p53 tumour suppressor and other proteins critical for 
tumour cell survival. However, developing selective deubiquitinase inhibitors has
been challenging and no co-crystal structures have been solved with
small-molecule inhibitors. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance-based screening
and structure-based design, we describe the development of selective USP7
inhibitors GNE-6640 and GNE-6776. These compounds induce tumour cell death and
enhance cytotoxicity with chemotherapeutic agents and targeted compounds,
including PIM kinase inhibitors. Structural studies reveal that GNE-6640 and
GNE-6776 non-covalently target USP7 12 Å distant from the catalytic cysteine. The
compounds attenuate ubiquitin binding and thus inhibit USP7 deubiquitinase
activity. GNE-6640 and GNE-6776 interact with acidic residues that mediate
hydrogen-bond interactions with the ubiquitin Lys48 side chain, suggesting that
USP7 preferentially interacts with and cleaves ubiquitin moieties that have free 
Lys48 side chains. We investigated this idea by engineering di-ubiquitin chains
containing differential proximal and distal isotopic labels and measuring USP7
binding by nuclear magnetic resonance. This preferential binding protracted the
depolymerization kinetics of Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains relative to
Lys63-linked chains. In summary, engineering compounds that inhibit USP7 activity
by attenuating ubiquitin binding suggests opportunities for developing other
deubiquitinase inhibitors and may be a strategy more broadly applicable to
inhibiting proteins that require ubiquitin binding for full functional activity.

Diverse forms of nanoscale architecture generate structural colour and perform
signalling functions within and between species. Structural colour is the result 
of the interference of light from approximately regular periodic structures; some
structural disorder is, however, inevitable in biological organisms. Is this
disorder functional and subject to evolutionary selection, or is it simply an
unavoidable outcome of biological developmental processes? Here we show that
disordered nanostructures enable flowers to produce visual signals that are
salient to bees. These disordered nanostructures (identified in most major
lineages of angiosperms) have distinct anatomies but convergent optical
properties; they all produce angle-dependent scattered light, predominantly at
short wavelengths (ultraviolet and blue). We manufactured artificial flowers with
nanoscale structures that possessed tailored levels of disorder in order to
investigate how foraging bumblebees respond to this optical effect. We conclude
that floral nanostructures have evolved, on multiple independent occasions, an
effective degree of relative spatial disorder that generates a photonic signature
that is highly salient to insect pollinators.

In several organ systems, the transitional zone between different types of
epithelium is a hotspot for pre-neoplastic metaplasia and malignancy, but the
cells of origin for these metaplastic epithelia and subsequent malignancies
remain unknown. In the case of Barrett's oesophagus, intestinal metaplasia occurs
at the gastro-oesophageal junction, where stratified squamous epithelium
transitions into simple columnar cells. On the basis of a number of experimental 
models, several alternative cell types have been proposed as the source of this
metaplasia but in all cases the evidence is inconclusive: no model completely
mimics Barrett's oesophagus in terms of the presence of intestinal goblet cells. 
Here we describe a transitional columnar epithelium with distinct basal
progenitor cells (p63+KRT5+KRT7+) at the squamous-columnar junction of the upper 
gastrointestinal tract in a mouse model. We use multiple models and lineage
tracing strategies to show that this squamous-columnar junction basal cell
population serves as a source of progenitors for the transitional epithelium. On 
ectopic expression of CDX2, these transitional basal progenitors differentiate
into intestinal-like epithelium (including goblet cells) and thereby reproduce
Barrett's metaplasia. A similar transitional columnar epithelium is present at
the transitional zones of other mouse tissues (including the anorectal junction) 
as well as in the gastro-oesophageal junction in the human gut. Acid
reflux-induced oesophagitis and the multilayered epithelium (believed to be a
precursor of Barrett's oesophagus) are both characterized by the expansion of the
transitional basal progenitor cells. Our findings reveal a previously
unidentified transitional zone in the epithelium of the upper gastrointestinal
tract and provide evidence that the p63+KRT5+KRT7+ basal cells in this zone are
the cells of origin for multi-layered epithelium and Barrett's oesophagus.

Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit numerous crystal
phases with distinct structures, symmetries and physical properties. Exploring
the physics of transitions between these different structural phases in two
dimensions may provide a means of switching material properties, with
implications for potential applications. Structural phase transitions in TMDs
have so far been induced by thermal or chemical means; purely electrostatic
control over crystal phases through electrostatic doping was recently proposed as
a theoretical possibility, but has not yet been realized. Here we report the
experimental demonstration of an electrostatic-doping-driven phase transition
between the hexagonal and monoclinic phases of monolayer molybdenum ditelluride
(MoTe2). We find that the phase transition shows a hysteretic loop in Raman
spectra, and can be reversed by increasing or decreasing the gate voltage. We
also combine second-harmonic generation spectroscopy with polarization-resolved
Raman spectroscopy to show that the induced monoclinic phase preserves the
crystal orientation of the original hexagonal phase. Moreover, this structural
phase transition occurs simultaneously across the whole sample. This
electrostatic-doping control of structural phase transition opens up new
possibilities for developing phase-change devices based on atomically thin
membranes.

Malaria transmission is influenced by climate, land use and deliberate
interventions. Recent declines have been observed in malaria transmission. Here
we show that the African continent has witnessed a long-term decline in the
prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum from 40% prevalence in the period 1900-1929
to 24% prevalence in the period 2010-2015, a trend that has been interrupted by
periods of rapidly increasing or decreasing transmission. The cycles and trend
over the past 115 years are inconsistent with explanations in terms of climate or
deliberate intervention alone. Previous global initiatives have had minor impacts
on malaria transmission, and a historically unprecedented decline has been
observed since 2000. However, there has been little change in the high
transmission belt that covers large parts of West and Central Africa. Previous
efforts to model the changing patterns of P. falciparum transmission intensity in
Africa have been limited to the past 15 years or have used maps drawn from
historical expert opinions. We provide quantitative data, from 50,424 surveys at 
36,966 geocoded locations, that covers 115 years of malaria history in
sub-Saharan Africa; inferring from these data to future trends, we would expect
continued reductions in malaria transmission, punctuated with resurgences.

Chromatin-remodelling factors change nucleosome positioning and facilitate DNA
transcription, replication, and repair. The conserved remodelling factor
chromodomain-helicase-DNA binding protein 1(Chd1) can shift nucleosomes and
induce regular nucleosome spacing. Chd1 is required for the passage of RNA
polymerase IIthrough nucleosomes and for cellular pluripotency. Chd1 contains the
DNA-binding domains SANT and SLIDE, a bilobal motor domain that hydrolyses ATP,
and a regulatory double chromodomain. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy
structure of Chd1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to a nucleosome
at a resolution of 4.8 Å. Chd1 detaches two turns of DNA from the histone octamer
and binds between the two DNA gyres in a state poised for catalysis. The SANT and
SLIDE domains contact detached DNA around superhelical location (SHL) -7 of the
first DNA gyre. The ATPase motor binds the second DNA gyre at SHL +2 and is
anchored to the N-terminal tail of histone H4, as seen in a recent
nucleosome-Snf2 ATPase structure. Comparisons with published results reveal that 
the double chromodomain swings towards nucleosomal DNA at SHL +1, resulting in
ATPase closure. The ATPase can then promote translocation of DNA towards the
nucleosome dyad, thereby loosening the first DNA gyre and remodelling the
nucleosome. Translocation may involve ratcheting of the two lobes of the ATPase, 
which is trapped in a pre- or post-translocation state in the absence or
presence, respectively, of transition state-mimicking compounds.

Ordinarily, the strength and plasticity properties of a metal are defined by
dislocations-line defects in the crystal lattice whose motion results in material
slippage along lattice planes. Dislocation dynamics models are usually used as
mesoscale proxies for true atomistic dynamics, which are computationally
expensive to perform routinely. However, atomistic simulations accurately capture
every possible mechanism of material response, resolving every "jiggle and
wiggle" of atomic motion, whereas dislocation dynamics models do not. Here we
present fully dynamic atomistic simulations of bulk single-crystal plasticity in 
the body-centred-cubic metal tantalum. Our goal is to quantify the conditions
under which the limits of dislocation-mediated plasticity are reached and to
understand what happens to the metal beyond any such limit. In our simulations,
the metal is compressed at ultrahigh strain rates along its [001] crystal axis
under conditions of constant pressure, temperature and strain rate. To address
the complexity of crystal plasticity processes on the length scales (85-340 nm)
and timescales (1 ns-1μs) that we examine, we use recently developed methods of
in situ computational microscopy to recast the enormous amount of transient
trajectory data generated in our simulations into a form that can be analysed by 
a human. Our simulations predict that, on reaching certain limiting conditions of
strain, dislocations alone can no longer relieve mechanical loads; instead,
another mechanism, known as deformation twinning (the sudden re-orientation of
the crystal lattice), takes over as the dominant mode of dynamic response. Below 
this limit, the metal assumes a strain-path-independent steady state of plastic
flow in which the flow stress and the dislocation density remain constant as long
as the conditions of straining thereafter remain unchanged. In this distinct
state, tantalum flows like a viscous fluid while retaining its crystal lattice
and remaining a strong and stiff metal.

plough marks.

Marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) processes could accelerate future retreat of 
the Antarctic Ice Sheet if ice shelves that buttress grounding lines more than
800 metres below sea level are lost. The present-day grounding zones of the Pine 
Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica need to retreat only short
distances before they reach extensive retrograde slopes. When grounding zones of 
glaciers retreat onto such slopes, theoretical considerations and modelling
results indicate that the retreat becomes unstable (marine ice-sheet instability)
and thus accelerates. It is thought that MICI is triggered when this retreat
produces ice cliffs above the water line with heights approaching about 90
metres. However, observational evidence confirming the action of MICI has not
previously been reported. Here we present observational evidence that rapid
deglacial ice-sheet retreat into Pine Island Bay proceeded in a similar manner to
that simulated in a recent modelling study, driven by MICI. Iceberg-keel plough
marks on the sea-floor provide geological evidence of past and present iceberg
morphology, keel depth and drift direction. From the planform shape and
cross-sectional morphologies of iceberg-keel plough marks, we find that iceberg
calving during the most recent deglaciation was not characterized by small
numbers of large, tabular icebergs as is observed today, which would produce
wide, flat-based plough marks or toothcomb-like multi-keeled plough marks.
Instead, it was characterized by large numbers of smaller icebergs with V-shaped 
keels. Geological evidence of the form and water-depth distribution of the plough
marks indicates calving-margin thicknesses equivalent to the threshold that is
predicted to trigger ice-cliff structural collapse as a result of MICI. We infer 
rapid and sustained ice-sheet retreat driven by MICI, commencing around 12,300
years ago and terminating before about 11,200 years ago, which produced large
numbers of icebergs smaller than the typical tabular icebergs produced today. Our
findings demonstrate the effective operation of MICI in the past, and highlight
its potential contribution to accelerated future retreat of the Antarctic Ice
Sheet.

The regulation of size, volume and mass in living cells is physiologically
important, and dysregulation of these parameters gives rise to many diseases.
Cell mass is largely determined by the amount of water, proteins, lipids,
carbohydrates and nucleic acids present in a cell, and is tightly linked to
metabolism, proliferation and gene expression. Technologies have emerged in
recent years that make it possible to track the masses of single suspended cells 
and adherent cells. However, it has not been possible to track individual
adherent cells in physiological conditions at the mass and time resolutions
required to observe fast cellular dynamics. Here we introduce a cell balance (a
'picobalance'), based on an optically excited microresonator, that measures the
total mass of single or multiple adherent cells in culture conditions over days
with millisecond time resolution and picogram mass sensitivity. Using our
technique, we observe that the mass of living mammalian cells fluctuates
intrinsically by around one to four per cent over timescales of seconds
throughout the cell cycle. Perturbation experiments link these mass fluctuations 
to the basic cellular processes of ATP synthesis and water transport.
Furthermore, we show that growth and cell cycle progression are arrested in cells
infected with vaccinia virus, but mass fluctuations continue until cell death.
Our measurements suggest that all living cells show fast and subtle mass
fluctuations throughout the cell cycle. As our cell balance is easy to handle and
compatible with fluorescence microscopy, we anticipate that our approach will
contribute to the understanding of cell mass regulation in various cell states
and across timescales, which is important in areas including physiology, cancer
research, stem-cell differentiation and drug discovery.

Pressure-driven shock waves in solid materials can cause extreme damage and
deformation. Understanding this deformation and the associated defects that are
created in the material is crucial in the study of a wide range of phenomena,
including planetary formation and asteroid impact sites, the formation of
interstellar dust clouds, ballistic penetrators, spacecraft shielding and
ductility in high-performance ceramics. At the lattice level, the basic
mechanisms of plastic deformation are twinning (whereby crystallites with a
mirror-image lattice form) and slip (whereby lattice dislocations are generated
and move), but determining which of these mechanisms is active during deformation
is challenging. Experiments that characterized lattice defects have typically
examined the microstructure of samples after deformation, and so are complicated 
by post-shock annealing and reverberations. In addition, measurements have been
limited to relatively modest pressures (less than 100 gigapascals). In situ X-ray
diffraction experiments can provide insights into the dynamic behaviour of
materials, but have only recently been applied to plasticity during shock
compression and have yet to provide detailed insight into competing deformation
mechanisms. Here we present X-ray diffraction experiments with femtosecond
resolution that capture in situ, lattice-level information on the microstructural
processes that drive shock-wave-driven deformation. To demonstrate this method we
shock-compress the body-centred-cubic material tantalum-an important material for
high-energy-density physics owing to its high shock impedance and high X-ray
opacity. Tantalum is also a material for which previous shock compression
simulations and experiments have provided conflicting information about the
dominant deformation mechanism. Our experiments reveal twinning and related
lattice rotation occurring on the timescale of tens of picoseconds. In addition, 
despite the common association between twinning and strong shocks, we find a
transition from twinning to dislocation-slip-dominated plasticity at high
pressure (more than 150 gigapascals), a regime that recovery experiments cannot
accurately access. The techniques demonstrated here will be useful for studying
shock waves and other high-strain-rate phenomena, as well as a broad range of
processes induced by plasticity.

Mouse embryonic stem cells derived from the epiblast contribute to the somatic
lineages and the germline but are excluded from the extra-embryonic tissues that 
are derived from the trophectoderm and the primitive endoderm upon reintroduction
to the blastocyst. Here we report that cultures of expanded potential stem cells 
can be established from individual eight-cell blastomeres, and by direct
conversion of mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells.
Remarkably, a single expanded potential stem cell can contribute both to the
embryo proper and to the trophectoderm lineages in a chimaera assay. Bona fide
trophoblast stem cell lines and extra-embryonic endoderm stem cells can be
directly derived from expanded potential stem cells in vitro. Molecular analyses 
of the epigenome and single-cell transcriptome reveal enrichment for
blastomere-specific signature and a dynamic DNA methylome in expanded potential
stem cells. The generation of mouse expanded potential stem cells highlights the 
feasibility of establishing expanded potential stem cells for other mammalian
species.

This review commemorates the 40th anniversary of DNA sequencing, a period in
which we have already witnessed multiple technological revolutions and a growth
in scale from a few kilobases to the first human genome, and now to millions of
human and a myriad of other genomes. DNA sequencing has been extensively and
creatively repurposed, including as a 'counter' for a vast range of molecular
phenomena. We predict that in the long view of history, the impact of DNA
sequencing will be on a par with that of the microscope.

Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a Ca2+-releasing cation
channel that mediates the calcium signalling and homeostasis of lysosomes.
Mutations in TRPML1 lead to mucolipidosis type IV, a severe lysosomal storage
disorder. Here we report two electron cryo-microscopy structures of full-length
human TRPML1: a 3.72-Å apo structure at pH 7.0 in the closed state, and a 3.49-Å 
agonist-bound structure at pH 6.0 in an open state. Several aromatic and
hydrophobic residues in pore helix 1, helices S5 and S6, and helix S6 of a
neighbouring subunit, form a hydrophobic cavity to house the agonist, suggesting 
a distinct agonist-binding site from that found in TRPV1, a TRP channel from a
different subfamily. The opening of TRPML1 is associated with distinct dilations 
of its lower gate together with a slight structural movement of pore helix 1. Our
work reveals the regulatory mechanism of TRPML channels, facilitates better
understanding of TRP channel activation, and provides insights into the molecular
basis of mucolipidosis type IV pathogenesis.

Transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) is a cation channel located
within endosomal and lysosomal membranes. Ubiquitously expressed in mammalian
cells, its loss-of-function mutations are the direct cause of type IV
mucolipidosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease. Here we present 
the single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of the mouse TRPML1
channel embedded in nanodiscs. Combined with mutagenesis analysis, the TRPML1
structure reveals that phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2)
binds to the N terminus of the channel-distal from the pore-and the
helix-turn-helix extension between segments S2 and S3 probably couples ligand
binding to pore opening. The tightly packed selectivity filter contains multiple 
ion-binding sites, and the conserved acidic residues form the luminal
Ca2+-blocking site that confers luminal pH and Ca2+ modulation on channel
conductance. A luminal linker domain forms a fenestrated canopy atop the channel,
providing several luminal ion passages to the pore and creating a negative
electrostatic trap, with a preference for divalent cations, at the luminal
entrance. The structure also reveals two equally distributed S4-S5 linker
conformations in the closed channel, suggesting an S4-S5 linker-mediated PtdInsP2
gating mechanism among TRPML channels.

Heterozygous mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene cause the neurological disorder
Rett syndrome. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) protein is an epigenetic 
reader whose binding to chromatin primarily depends on 5-methylcytosine.
Functionally, MeCP2 has been implicated in several cellular processes on the
basis of its reported interaction with more than 40 binding partners, including
transcriptional co-repressors (for example, the NCoR/SMRT complex),
transcriptional activators, RNA, chromatin remodellers, microRNA-processing
proteins and splicing factors. Accordingly, MeCP2 has been cast as a
multi-functional hub that integrates diverse processes that are essential in
mature neurons. At odds with the concept of broad functionality, missense
mutations that cause Rett syndrome are concentrated in two discrete clusters
coinciding with interaction sites for partner macromolecules: the methyl-CpG
binding domain and the NCoR/SMRT interaction domain. Here we test the hypothesis 
that the single dominant function of MeCP2 is to physically connect DNA with the 
NCoR/SMRT complex, by removing almost all amino-acid sequences except the
methyl-CpG binding and NCoR/SMRT interaction domains. We find that mice
expressing truncated MeCP2 lacking both the N- and C-terminal regions
(approximately half of the native protein) are phenotypically near-normal; and
those expressing a minimal MeCP2 additionally lacking a central domain survive
for over one year with only mild symptoms. This minimal protein is able to
prevent or reverse neurological symptoms when introduced into MeCP2-deficient
mice by genetic activation or virus-mediated delivery to the brain. Thus, despite
evolutionary conservation of the entire MeCP2 protein sequence, the DNA and
co-repressor binding domains alone are sufficient to avoid Rett syndrome-like
defects and may therefore have therapeutic utility.

The modulation of ion channel activity by lipids is increasingly recognized as a 
fundamental component of cellular signalling. The transient receptor potential
mucolipin (TRPML) channel family belongs to the TRP superfamily and is composed
of three members: TRPML1-TRPML3. TRPMLs are the major Ca2+-permeable channels on 
late endosomes and lysosomes (LEL). They regulate the release of Ca2+ from
organelles, which is important for various physiological processes, including
organelle trafficking and fusion. Loss-of-function mutations in the MCOLN1 gene, 
which encodes TRPML1, cause the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder
mucolipidosis type IV, and a gain-of-function mutation (Ala419Pro) in TRPML3
gives rise to the varitint-waddler (Va) mouse phenotype. Notably, TRPML channels 
are activated by the low-abundance and LEL-enriched signalling lipid
phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), whereas other
phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, which is enriched in plasma membranes,
inhibit TRPMLs. Conserved basic residues at the N terminus of the channel are
important for activation by PtdIns(3,5)P2 and inhibition by PtdIns(4,5)P2.
However, owing to a lack of structural information, the mechanism by which TRPML 
channels recognize PtdIns(3,5)P2 and increase their Ca2+ conductance remains
unclear. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a
full-length TRPML3 channel from the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) at an
overall resolution of 2.9 Å. Our structure reveals not only the molecular basis
of ion conduction but also the unique architecture of TRPMLs, wherein the voltage
sensor-like domain is linked to the pore via a cytosolic domain that we term the 
mucolipin domain. Combined with functional studies, these data suggest that the
mucolipin domain is responsible for PtdIns(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent channel 
activation, and that it acts as a 'gating pulley' for lipid-dependent TRPML
gating.

Graphene oxide membranes-partially oxidized, stacked sheets of graphene-can
provide ultrathin, high-flux and energy-efficient membranes for precise ionic and
molecular sieving in aqueous solution. These materials have shown potential in a 
variety of applications, including water desalination and purification, gas and
ion separation, biosensors, proton conductors, lithium-based batteries and
super-capacitors. Unlike the pores of carbon nanotube membranes, which have fixed
sizes, the pores of graphene oxide membranes-that is, the interlayer spacing
between graphene oxide sheets (a sheet is a single flake inside the membrane)-are
of variable size. Furthermore, it is difficult to reduce the interlayer spacing
sufficiently to exclude small ions and to maintain this spacing against the
tendency of graphene oxide membranes to swell when immersed in aqueous solution. 
These challenges hinder the potential ion filtration applications of graphene
oxide membranes. Here we demonstrate cationic control of the interlayer spacing
of graphene oxide membranes with ångström precision using K+, Na+, Ca2+, Li+ or
Mg2+ ions. Moreover, membrane spacings controlled by one type of cation can
efficiently and selectively exclude other cations that have larger hydrated
volumes. First-principles calculations and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy
reveal that the location of the most stable cation adsorption is where oxide
groups and aromatic rings coexist. Previous density functional theory
computations show that other cations (Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr2+ and Pb2+)
should have a much stronger cation-π interaction with the graphene sheet than Na+
has, suggesting that other ions could be used to produce a wider range of
interlayer spacings.

Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene
expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of
cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary
cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with
pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the
cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the
innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked 
to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term
inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that
associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic
chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show
impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation
upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, 
and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall,
our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a
pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the
cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating
inflammation-related disorders.

The tumour suppressor complex BRCA1-BARD1 functions in the repair of DNA
double-stranded breaks by homologous recombination. During this process,
BRCA1-BARD1 facilitates the nucleolytic resection of DNA ends to generate a
single-stranded template for the recruitment of another tumour suppressor
complex, BRCA2-PALB2, and the recombinase RAD51. Here, by examining purified
wild-type and mutant BRCA1-BARD1, we show that both BRCA1 and BARD1 bind DNA and 
interact with RAD51, and that BRCA1-BARD1 enhances the recombinase activity of
RAD51. Mechanistically, BRCA1-BARD1 promotes the assembly of the synaptic
complex, an essential intermediate in RAD51-mediated DNA joint formation. We
provide evidence that BRCA1 and BARD1 are indispensable for RAD51 stimulation.
Notably, BRCA1-BARD1 mutants with weakened RAD51 interactions show compromised
DNA joint formation and impaired mediation of homologous recombination and DNA
repair in cells. Our results identify a late role of BRCA1-BARD1 in homologous
recombination, an attribute of the tumour suppressor complex that could be
targeted in cancer therapy.

Long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials-widely commercialized as
'glow-in-the-dark' paints-store excitation energy in excited states that slowly
release this energy as light. At present, most LPL materials are based on an
inorganic system of strontium aluminium oxide (SrAl2O4) doped with europium and
dysprosium, and exhibit emission for more than ten hours. However, this system
requires rare elements and temperatures higher than 1,000 degrees Celsius during 
fabrication, and light scattering by SrAl2O4 powders limits the transparency of
LPL paints. Here we show that an organic LPL (OLPL) system of two simple organic 
molecules that is free from rare elements and easy to fabricate can generate
emission that lasts for more than one hour at room temperature. Previous organic 
systems, which were based on two-photon ionization, required high excitation
intensities and low temperatures. By contrast, our OLPL system-which is based on 
emission from excited complexes (exciplexes) upon the recombination of long-lived
charge-separated states-can be excited by a standard white LED light source and
generate long emission even at temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius. This OLPL 
system is transparent, soluble, and potentially flexible and colour-tunable,
opening new applications for LPL in large-area and flexible paints, biomarkers,
fabrics, and windows. Moreover, the study of long-lived charge separation in this
system should advance understanding of a wide variety of organic semiconductor
devices.

The RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) has been
widely repurposed for genome editing. High-fidelity (SpCas9-HF1) and enhanced
specificity (eSpCas9(1.1)) variants exhibit substantially reduced off-target
cleavage in human cells, but the mechanism of target discrimination and the
potential to further improve fidelity are unknown. Here, using single-molecule
Förster resonance energy transfer experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and
eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state when bound to mismatched targets.
We find that a non-catalytic domain within Cas9, REC3, recognizes target
complementarity and governs the HNH nuclease to regulate overall catalytic
competence. Exploiting this observation, we design a new hyper-accurate Cas9
variant (HypaCas9) that demonstrates high genome-wide specificity without
compromising on-target activity in human cells. These results offer a more
comprehensive model to rationalize and modify the balance between target
recognition and nuclease activation for precision genome editing.

All animals possess a repertoire of innate (or instinctive) behaviours, which can
be performed without training. Whether such behaviours are mediated by
anatomically distinct and/or genetically specified neural pathways remains
unknown. Here we report that neural representations within the mouse
hypothalamus, that underlie innate social behaviours, are shaped by social
experience. Oestrogen receptor 1-expressing (Esr1+) neurons in the ventrolateral 
subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) control mating and fighting 
in rodents. We used microendoscopy to image Esr1+ neuronal activity in the VMHvl 
of male mice engaged in these social behaviours. In sexually and socially
experienced adult males, divergent and characteristic neural ensembles
represented male versus female conspecifics. However, in inexperienced adult
males, male and female intruders activated overlapping neuronal populations.
Sex-specific neuronal ensembles gradually separated as the mice acquired social
and sexual experience. In mice permitted to investigate but not to mount or
attack conspecifics, ensemble divergence did not occur. However, 30 minutes of
sexual experience with a female was sufficient to promote the separation of male 
and female ensembles and to induce an attack response 24 h later. These
observations uncover an unexpected social experience-dependent component to the
formation of hypothalamic neural assemblies controlling innate social behaviours.
More generally, they reveal plasticity and dynamic coding in an evolutionarily
ancient deep subcortical structure that is traditionally viewed as a 'hard-wired'
system.

A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns,
tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo
became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree
search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural
networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human
expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an 
algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or
domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural
network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner
of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search,
resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next
iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman
performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating
AlphaGo.

Precise comparisons of the fundamental properties of matter-antimatter conjugates
provide sensitive tests of charge-parity-time (CPT) invariance, which is an
important symmetry that rests on basic assumptions of the standard model of
particle physics. Experiments on mesons, leptons and baryons have compared
different properties of matter-antimatter conjugates with fractional
uncertainties at the parts-per-billion level or better. One specific quantity,
however, has so far only been known to a fractional uncertainty at the
parts-per-million level: the magnetic moment of the antiproton, . The
extraordinary difficulty in measuring with high precision is caused by its
intrinsic smallness; for example, it is 660 times smaller than the magnetic
moment of the positron. Here we report a high-precision measurement of in units
of the nuclear magneton μN with a fractional precision of 1.5 parts per billion
(68% confidence level). We use a two-particle spectroscopy method in an advanced 
cryogenic multi-Penning trap system. Our result  = -2.7928473441(42)μN (where the
number in parentheses represents the 68% confidence interval on the last digits
of the value) improves the precision of the previous best measurement by a factor
of approximately 350. The measured value is consistent with the proton magnetic
moment, μp = 2.792847350(9)μN, and is in agreement with CPT invariance.
Consequently, this measurement constrains the magnitude of certain CPT-violating 
effects to below 1.8 × 10-24 gigaelectronvolts, and a possible splitting of the
proton-antiproton magnetic moments by CPT-odd dimension-five interactions to
below 6 × 10-12 Bohr magnetons.

The discovery of Higgs-boson decays in a background of standard-model processes
was assisted by machine learning methods. The classifiers used to separate
signals such as these from background are trained using highly unerring but not
completely perfect simulations of the physical processes involved, often
resulting in incorrect labelling of background processes or signals (label noise)
and systematic errors. Here we use quantum and classical annealing (probabilistic
techniques for approximating the global maximum or minimum of a given function)
to solve a Higgs-signal-versus-background machine learning optimization problem, 
mapped to a problem of finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising spin
model. We build a set of weak classifiers based on the kinematic observables of
the Higgs decay photons, which we then use to construct a strong classifier. This
strong classifier is highly resilient against overtraining and against errors in 
the correlations of the physical observables in the training data. We show that
the resulting quantum and classical annealing-based classifier systems perform
comparably to the state-of-the-art machine learning methods that are currently
used in particle physics. However, in contrast to these methods, the
annealing-based classifiers are simple functions of directly interpretable
experimental parameters with clear physical meaning. The annealer-trained
classifiers use the excited states in the vicinity of the ground state and
demonstrate some advantage over traditional machine learning methods for small
training datasets. Given the relative simplicity of the algorithm and its
robustness to error, this technique may find application in other areas of
experimental particle physics, such as real-time decision making in
event-selection problems and classification in neutrino physics.

Viruses express several classes of non-coding RNAs; the functions and mechanisms 
by which most of these act are unknown. Herpesvirus saimiri, a γ-herpesvirus that
establishes latency in the T cells of New World primates and has the ability to
cause aggressive leukaemias and lymphomas in non-natural hosts, expresses seven
small nuclear uracil-rich non-coding RNAs (called HSURs) in latently infected
cells. These HSURs associate with Sm proteins, and share biogenesis and
structural features with cellular Sm-class small nuclear RNAs. One of these HSURs
(HSUR2) base-pairs with two host cellular microRNAs (miR-142-3p and miR-16) but
does not affect their abundance or activity, which suggests that its interactions
with them perform alternative functions. Here we show that HSUR2 also base-pairs 
with mRNAs in infected cells. We combined in vivo psoralen-mediated RNA-RNA
crosslinking and high-throughput sequencing to identify the mRNAs targeted by
HSUR2, which include mRNAs that encode retinoblastoma and factors involved in p53
signalling and apoptosis. We show that HSUR2 represses the expression of target
mRNAs and that base-pairing between HSUR2 and miR-142-3p and miR-16 is essential 
for this repression, suggesting that HSUR2 recruits these two cellular microRNAs 
to its target mRNAs. Furthermore, we show that HSUR2 uses this mechanism to
inhibit apoptosis. Our results uncover a role for this viral Sm-class RNA as a
microRNA adaptor in the regulation of gene expression that follows precursor mRNA
processing.

established, heart failure commonly results in mortality. The Hippo pathway, a
kinase cascade that prevents adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and regeneration, 
is upregulated in human heart failure. Here we show that deletion of the Hippo
pathway component Salvador (Salv) in mouse hearts with established ischaemic
heart failure after myocardial infarction induces a reparative genetic program
with increased scar border vascularity, reduced fibrosis, and recovery of pumping
function compared with controls. Using translating ribosomal affinity
purification, we isolate cardiomyocyte-specific translating messenger RNA.
Hippo-deficient cardiomyocytes have increased expression of proliferative genes
and stress response genes, such as the mitochondrial quality control gene, Park2.
Genetic studies indicate that Park2 is essential for heart repair, suggesting a
requirement for mitochondrial quality control in regenerating myocardium. Gene
therapy with a virus encoding Salv short hairpin RNA improves heart function when
delivered at the time of infarct or after ischaemic heart failure following
myocardial infarction was established. Our findings indicate that the failing
heart has a previously unrecognized reparative capacity involving more than
cardiomyocyte renewal.

Homologous recombination repairs DNA double-strand breaks and must function even 
on actively transcribed DNA. Because break repair prevents chromosome loss, the
completion of repair is expected to outweigh the transcription of broken
templates. However, the interplay between DNA break repair and transcription
processivity is unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor GreA inhibits
break repair in Escherichia coli. GreA restarts backtracked RNA polymerase and
hence promotes transcription fidelity. We report that removal of GreA results in 
markedly enhanced break repair via the classic RecBCD-RecA pathway. Using a
deep-sequencing method to measure chromosomal exonucleolytic degradation, we
demonstrate that the absence of GreA limits RecBCD-mediated resection. Our
findings suggest that increased RNA polymerase backtracking promotes break repair
by instigating RecA loading by RecBCD, without the influence of canonical Chi
signals. The idea that backtracked RNA polymerase can stimulate recombination
presents a DNA transaction conundrum: a transcription fidelity factor that
compromises genomic integrity.

Observations from cultured cells, animal models and patients raise the
possibility that the dependency of tumours on the therapeutic drugs to which they
have acquired resistance represents a vulnerability with potential applications
in cancer treatment. However, for this drug addiction trait to become of clinical
interest, we must first define the mechanism that underlies it. We performed an
unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen on melanoma cells that were both resistant
and addicted to inhibition of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, in order 
to functionally mine their genome for 'addiction genes'. Here we describe a
signalling pathway comprising ERK2 kinase and JUNB and FRA1 transcription
factors, disruption of which allowed addicted tumour cells to survive on
treatment discontinuation. This occurred in both cultured cells and mice and was 
irrespective of the acquired drug resistance mechanism. In melanoma and lung
cancer cells, death induced by drug withdrawal was preceded by a specific
ERK2-dependent phenotype switch, alongside transcriptional reprogramming
reminiscent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In melanoma cells, this
reprogramming caused the shutdown of microphthalmia-associated transcription
factor (MITF), a lineage survival oncoprotein; restoring this protein reversed
phenotype switching and prevented the lethality associated with drug addiction.
In patients with melanoma that had progressed during treatment with a BRAF
inhibitor, treatment cessation was followed by increased expression of the
receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, which is associated with the phenotype switch. Drug
discontinuation synergized with the melanoma chemotherapeutic agent dacarbazine
by further suppressing MITF and its prosurvival target, B-cell lymphoma 2
(BCL-2), and by inducing DNA damage in cancer cells. Our results uncover a
pathway that underpins drug addiction in cancer cells, which may help to guide
the use of alternating therapeutic strategies for enhanced clinical responses in 
drug-resistant cancers.

RNA has important and diverse roles in biology, but molecular tools to manipulate
and measure it are limited. For example, RNA interference can efficiently
knockdown RNAs, but it is prone to off-target effects, and visualizing RNAs
typically relies on the introduction of exogenous tags. Here we demonstrate that 
the class 2 type VI RNA-guided RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas effector Cas13a
(previously known as C2c2) can be engineered for mammalian cell RNA knockdown and
binding. After initial screening of 15 orthologues, we identified Cas13a from
Leptotrichia wadei (LwaCas13a) as the most effective in an interference assay in 
Escherichia coli. LwaCas13a can be heterologously expressed in mammalian and
plant cells for targeted knockdown of either reporter or endogenous transcripts
with comparable levels of knockdown as RNA interference and improved specificity.
Catalytically inactive LwaCas13a maintains targeted RNA binding activity, which
we leveraged for programmable tracking of transcripts in live cells. Our results 
establish CRISPR-Cas13a as a flexible platform for studying RNA in mammalian
cells and therapeutic development.

The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase
that functions in two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, to regulate growth and
metabolism. GTPases, responding to signals generated by abiotic stressors,
nutrients, and, in metazoans, growth factors, play an important but poorly
understood role in TORC1 regulation. Here we report that, in budding yeast,
glucose withdrawal (which leads to an acute loss of TORC1 kinase activity)
triggers a similarly rapid Rag GTPase-dependent redistribution of TORC1 from
being semi-uniform around the vacuolar membrane to a single, vacuole-associated
cylindrical structure visible by super-resolution optical microscopy.
Three-dimensional reconstructions of cryo-electron micrograph images of these
purified cylinders demonstrate that TORC1 oligomerizes into a higher-level hollow
helical assembly, which we name a TOROID (TORC1 organized in inhibited domain).
Fitting of the recently described mammalian TORC1 structure into our helical map 
reveals that oligomerization leads to steric occlusion of the active site. Guided
by the implications from our reconstruction, we present a TOR1 allele that
prevents both TOROID formation and TORC1 inactivation in response to glucose
withdrawal, demonstrating that oligomerization is necessary for TORC1
inactivation. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which Rag GTPases regulate 
TORC1 activity and suggest that the reversible assembly and/or disassembly of
higher-level structures may be an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation
of protein kinases.

Under homeostatic conditions, animals use well-defined hypothalamic neural
circuits to help maintain stable body weight, by integrating metabolic and
hormonal signals from the periphery to balance food consumption and energy
expenditure. In stressed or disease conditions, however, animals use alternative 
neuronal pathways to adapt to the metabolic challenges of altered energy demand. 
Recent studies have identified brain areas outside the hypothalamus that are
activated under these 'non-homeostatic' conditions, but the molecular nature of
the peripheral signals and brain-localized receptors that activate these circuits
remains elusive. Here we identify glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) as a brainstem-restricted receptor for growth and
differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). GDF15 regulates food intake, energy
expenditure and body weight in response to metabolic and toxin-induced stresses; 
we show that Gfral knockout mice are hyperphagic under stressed conditions and
are resistant to chemotherapy-induced anorexia and body weight loss. GDF15
activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized exclusively in the area postrema and
nucleus tractus solitarius of the mouse brainstem. It then triggers the
activation of neurons localized within the parabrachial nucleus and central
amygdala, which constitute part of the 'emergency circuit' that shapes feeding
responses to stressful conditions. GDF15 levels increase in response to tissue
stress and injury, and elevated levels are associated with body weight loss in
numerous chronic human diseases. By isolating GFRAL as the receptor for
GDF15-induced anorexia and weight loss, we identify a mechanistic basis for the
non-homeostatic regulation of neural circuitry by a peripheral signal associated 
with tissue damage and stress. These findings provide opportunities to develop
therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders with altered energy demand.

High-performance semiconductor films with vertical compositions that are designed
to atomic-scale precision provide the foundation for modern integrated circuitry 
and novel materials discovery. One approach to realizing such films is sequential
layer-by-layer assembly, whereby atomically thin two-dimensional building blocks 
are vertically stacked, and held together by van der Waals interactions. With
this approach, graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides-which represent one-
and three-atom-thick two-dimensional building blocks, respectively-have been used
to realize previously inaccessible heterostructures with interesting physical
properties. However, no large-scale assembly method exists at present that
maintains the intrinsic properties of these two-dimensional building blocks while
producing pristine interlayer interfaces, thus limiting the layer-by-layer
assembly method to small-scale proof-of-concept demonstrations. Here we report
the generation of wafer-scale semiconductor films with a very high level of
spatial uniformity and pristine interfaces. The vertical composition and
properties of these films are designed at the atomic scale using layer-by-layer
assembly of two-dimensional building blocks under vacuum. We fabricate several
large-scale, high-quality heterostructure films and devices, including
superlattice films with vertical compositions designed layer-by-layer,
batch-fabricated tunnel device arrays with resistances that can be tuned over
four orders of magnitude, band-engineered heterostructure tunnel diodes, and
millimetre-scale ultrathin membranes and windows. The stacked films are
detachable, suspendable and compatible with water or plastic surfaces, which will
enable their integration with advanced optical and mechanical systems.

The ability to steer electrons using the strong electromagnetic field of light
has opened up the possibility of controlling electron dynamics on the
sub-femtosecond (less than 10-15 seconds) timescale. In dielectrics and
semiconductors, various light-field-driven effects have been explored, including 
high-harmonic generation, sub-optical-cycle interband population transfer and the
non-perturbative change of the transient polarizability. In contrast, much less
is known about light-field-driven electron dynamics in narrow-bandgap systems or 
in conductors, in which screening due to free carriers or light absorption
hinders the application of strong optical fields. Graphene is a promising
platform with which to achieve light-field-driven control of electrons in a
conducting material, because of its broadband and ultrafast optical response,
weak screening and high damage threshold. Here we show that a current induced in 
monolayer graphene by two-cycle laser pulses is sensitive to the electric-field
waveform, that is, to the exact shape of the optical carrier field of the pulse, 
which is controlled by the carrier-envelope phase, with a precision on the
attosecond (10-18 seconds) timescale. Such a current, dependent on the
carrier-envelope phase, shows a striking reversal of the direction of the current
as a function of the driving field amplitude at about two volts per nanometre.
This reversal indicates a transition of light-matter interaction from the
weak-field (photon-driven) regime to the strong-field (light-field-driven)
regime, where the intraband dynamics influence interband transitions. We show
that in this strong-field regime the electron dynamics are governed by
sub-optical-cycle Landau-Zener-Stückelberg interference, composed of coherent
repeated Landau-Zener transitions on the femtosecond timescale. Furthermore, the 
influence of this sub-optical-cycle interference can be controlled with the laser
polarization state. These coherent electron dynamics in graphene take place on a 
hitherto unexplored timescale, faster than electron-electron scattering (tens of 
femtoseconds) and electron-phonon scattering (hundreds of femtoseconds). We
expect these results to have direct ramifications for band-structure tomography
and light-field-driven petahertz electronics.

Patches on the surfaces of colloidal particles provide directional information
that enables the self-assembly of the particles into higher-order structures.
Although computational tools can make quantitative predictions and can generate
design rules that link the patch motif of a particle to its internal
microstructure and to the emergent properties of the self-assembled materials,
the experimental realization of model systems of particles with surface patches
(or 'patchy' particles) remains a challenge. Synthetic patchy colloidal particles
are often poor geometric approximations of the digital building blocks used in
simulations and can only rarely be manufactured in sufficiently high yields to be
routinely used as experimental model systems. Here we introduce a method, which
we refer to as colloidal fusion, for fabricating functional patchy particles in a
tunable and scalable manner. Using coordination dynamics and wetting forces, we
engineer hybrid liquid-solid clusters that evolve into particles with a range of 
patchy surface morphologies on addition of a plasticizer. We are able to predict 
and control the evolutionary pathway by considering surface-energy minimization, 
leading to two main branches of product: first, spherical particles with liquid
surface patches, capable of forming curable bonds with neighbouring particles to 
assemble robust supracolloidal structures; and second, particles with a faceted
liquid compartment, which can be cured and purified to yield colloidal polyhedra.
These findings outline a scalable strategy for the synthesis of patchy particles,
first by designing their surface patterns by computer simulation, and then by
recreating them in the laboratory with high fidelity.

X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences transcription from one of the two X
chromosomes in female mammalian cells to balance expression dosage between XX
females and XY males. XCI is, however, incomplete in humans: up to one-third of
X-chromosomal genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosomes
(Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the degree of 'escape' from
inactivation varying between genes and individuals. The extent to which XCI is
shared between cells and tissues remains poorly characterized, as does the degree
to which incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene
expression and phenotypic traits. Here we describe a systematic survey of XCI,
integrating over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449 individuals spanning 29 tissues
from GTEx (v6p release) and 940 single-cell transcriptomes, combined with genomic
sequence data. We show that XCI at 683 X-chromosomal genes is generally uniform
across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues,
individuals and cells. We show that incomplete XCI affects at least 23% of
X-chromosomal genes, identify seven genes that escape XCI with support from
multiple lines of evidence and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex
biases in gene expression, establishing incomplete XCI as a mechanism that is
likely to introduce phenotypic diversity. Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI 
across human tissues helps to increase our understanding of the extent and impact
of the incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI.

Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation 
across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that
underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)
project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across
individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily
accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 
human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression
levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal
genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic
effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal
effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also
demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify
genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a
mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.

Haumea-one of the four known trans-Neptunian dwarf planets-is a very elongated
and rapidly rotating body. In contrast to other dwarf planets, its size, shape,
albedo and density are not well constrained. The Centaur Chariklo was the first
body other than a giant planet known to have a ring system, and the Centaur
Chiron was later found to possess something similar to Chariklo's rings. Here we 
report observations from multiple Earth-based observatories of Haumea passing in 
front of a distant star (a multi-chord stellar occultation). Secondary events
observed around the main body of Haumea are consistent with the presence of a
ring with an opacity of 0.5, width of 70 kilometres and radius of about 2,287
kilometres. The ring is coplanar with both Haumea's equator and the orbit of its 
satellite Hi'iaka. The radius of the ring places it close to the 3:1 mean-motion 
resonance with Haumea's spin period-that is, Haumea rotates three times on its
axis in the time that a ring particle completes one revolution. The occultation
by the main body provides an instantaneous elliptical projected shape with axes
of about 1,704 kilometres and 1,138 kilometres. Combined with rotational light
curves, the occultation constrains the three-dimensional orientation of Haumea
and its triaxial shape, which is inconsistent with a homogeneous body in
hydrostatic equilibrium. Haumea's largest axis is at least 2,322 kilometres,
larger than previously thought, implying an upper limit for its density of 1,885 
kilograms per cubic metre and a geometric albedo of 0.51, both smaller than
previous estimates. In addition, this estimate of the density of Haumea is closer
to that of Pluto than are previous estimates, in line with expectations. No
global nitrogen- or methane-dominated atmosphere was detected.

Heat is fundamental to power generation and many industrial processes, and is
most useful at high temperatures because it can be converted more efficiently to 
other types of energy. However, efficient transportation, storage and conversion 
of heat at extreme temperatures (more than about 1,300 kelvin) is impractical for
many applications. Liquid metals can be very effective media for transferring
heat at high temperatures, but liquid-metal pumping has been limited by the
corrosion of metal infrastructures. Here we demonstrate a ceramic, mechanical
pump that can be used to continuously circulate liquid tin at temperatures of
around 1,473-1,673 kelvin. Our approach to liquid-metal pumping is enabled by the
use of ceramics for the mechanical and sealing components, but owing to the
brittle nature of ceramics their use requires careful engineering. Our set-up
enables effective heat transfer using a liquid at previously unattainable
temperatures, and could be used for thermal storage and transport, electric power
production, and chemical or materials processing.

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved post-transcriptional
mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that diversifies the transcriptome by altering
selected nucleotides in RNA molecules. Although many editing sites have recently 
been discovered, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is
regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood. Here we
report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing,
discovered through an extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human
samples (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the
Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of other primate and
mouse samples. We show that editing levels in non-repetitive coding regions vary 
more between tissues than editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1
is the primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary editor of
non-repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically inactive ADAR3
predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing. Cross-species analysis of RNA
editing in several tissues revealed that species, rather than tissue type, is the
primary determinant of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed
regulation of RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved
coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we curated an
extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed that many editing sites
display distinct tissue-specific regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further 
analysis of the GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such 
as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the degradation of the
ADAR proteins. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex cis- and
trans-regulation of A-to-I editing.

Rare genetic variants are abundant in humans and are expected to contribute to
individual disease risk. While genetic association studies have successfully
identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies 
are not practical for identifying rare variants. Efforts to distinguish
pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to 
identify deleterious protein-coding alleles, but no analogous code exists for
non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare variants have phenotypic 
effects remains a major challenge. Rare non-coding variants have been associated 
with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues, but their effects
across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene expression outliers, or
individuals showing extreme expression levels for a particular gene, across 44
human tissues by using combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue
RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6p
release. We find that 58% of underexpression and 28% of overexpression outliers
have nearby conserved rare variants compared to 8% of non-outliers. Additionally,
we developed RIVER (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation), a Bayesian
statistical model that incorporates expression data to predict a regulatory
effect for rare variants with higher accuracy than models using genomic
annotations alone. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large
gene expression changes across tissues and provide an integrative method for
interpretation of rare variants in individual genomes.

Vertebrate genomes exhibit marked CG suppression-that is, lower than expected
numbers of 5'-CG-3' dinucleotides. This feature is likely to be due to C-to-T
mutations that have accumulated over hundreds of millions of years, driven by
CG-specific DNA methyl transferases and spontaneous methyl-cytosine deamination. 
Many RNA viruses of vertebrates that are not substrates for DNA methyl
transferases mimic the CG suppression of their hosts. This property of viral
genomes is unexplained. Here we show, using synonymous mutagenesis, that CG
suppression is essential for HIV-1 replication. The deleterious effect of CG
dinucleotides on HIV-1 replication was cumulative, associated with cytoplasmic
RNA depletion, and was exerted by CG dinucleotides in both translated and
non-translated exonic RNA sequences. A focused screen using small inhibitory RNAs
revealed that zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) inhibited virion production by 
cells infected with CG-enriched HIV-1. Crucially, HIV-1 mutants containing
segments whose CG content mimicked random nucleotide sequence were defective in
unmanipulated cells, but replicated normally in ZAP-deficient cells.
Crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing assays demonstrated that ZAP binds
directly and selectively to RNA sequences containing CG dinucleotides. These
findings suggest that ZAP exploits host CG suppression to identify non-self RNA. 
The dinucleotide composition of HIV-1, and perhaps other RNA viruses, appears to 
have adapted to evade this host defence.

Targeted BRAF inhibition (BRAFi) and combined BRAF and MEK inhibition (BRAFi and 
MEKi) therapies have markedly improved the clinical outcomes of patients with
metastatic melanoma. Unfortunately, the efficacy of these treatments is often
countered by the acquisition of drug resistance. Here we investigated the
molecular mechanisms that underlie acquired resistance to BRAFi and to the
combined therapy. Consistent with previous studies, we show that resistance to
BRAFi is mediated by ERK pathway reactivation. Resistance to the combined
therapy, however, is mediated by mechanisms independent of reactivation of ERK in
many resistant cell lines and clinical samples. p21-activated kinases (PAKs)
become activated in cells with acquired drug resistance and have a pivotal role
in mediating resistance. Our screening, using a reverse-phase protein array,
revealed distinct mechanisms by which PAKs mediate resistance to BRAFi and the
combined therapy. In BRAFi-resistant cells, PAKs phosphorylate CRAF and MEK to
reactivate ERK. In cells that are resistant to the combined therapy, PAKs
regulate JNK and β-catenin phosphorylation and mTOR pathway activation, and
inhibit apoptosis, thereby bypassing ERK. Together, our results provide insights 
into the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired drug resistance to current
targeted therapies, and may help to direct novel drug development efforts to
overcome acquired drug resistance.

Despite their fundamental biological and clinical importance, the molecular
mechanisms that regulate the first cell fate decisions in the human embryo are
not well understood. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to
investigate the function of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 during
human embryogenesis. We identified an efficient OCT4-targeting guide RNA using an
inducible human embryonic stem cell-based system and microinjection of mouse
zygotes. Using these refined methods, we efficiently and specifically targeted
the gene encoding OCT4 (POU5F1) in diploid human zygotes and found that
blastocyst development was compromised. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that,
in POU5F1-null cells, gene expression was downregulated not only for
extra-embryonic trophectoderm genes, such as CDX2, but also for regulators of the
pluripotent epiblast, including NANOG. By contrast, Pou5f1-null mouse embryos
maintained the expression of orthologous genes, and blastocyst development was
established, but maintenance was compromised. We conclude that
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing is a powerful method for investigating gene
function in the context of human development.

The characterization of baseline microbial and functional diversity in the human 
microbiome has enabled studies of microbiome-related disease, diversity,
biogeography, and molecular function. The National Institutes of Health Human
Microbiome Project has provided one of the broadest such characterizations so
far. Here we introduce a second wave of data from the study, comprising 1,631 new
metagenomes (2,355 total) targeting diverse body sites with multiple time points 
in 265 individuals. We applied updated profiling and assembly methods to provide 
new characterizations of microbiome personalization. Strain identification
revealed subspecies clades specific to body sites; it also quantified species
with phylogenetic diversity under-represented in isolate genomes. Body-wide
functional profiling classified pathways into universal, human-enriched, and body
site-enriched subsets. Finally, temporal analysis decomposed microbial variation 
into rapidly variable, moderately variable, and stable subsets. This study
furthers our knowledge of baseline human microbial diversity and enables an
understanding of personalized microbiome function and dynamics.

The dynamic and reversible acetylation of proteins, catalysed by histone
acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is a major epigenetic
regulatory mechanism of gene transcription and is associated with multiple
diseases. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently approved to treat certain 
cancers, but progress on the development of drug-like histone actyltransferase
inhibitors has lagged behind. The histone acetyltransferase paralogues p300 and
CREB-binding protein (CBP) are key transcriptional co-activators that are
essential for a multitude of cellular processes, and have also been implicated in
human pathological conditions (including cancer). Current inhibitors of the p300 
and CBP histone acetyltransferase domains, including natural products,
bi-substrate analogues and the widely used small molecule C646, lack potency or
selectivity. Here, we describe A-485, a potent, selective and drug-like catalytic
inhibitor of p300 and CBP. We present a high resolution (1.95 Å) co-crystal
structure of a small molecule bound to the catalytic active site of p300 and
demonstrate that A-485 competes with acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). A-485
selectively inhibited proliferation in lineage-specific tumour types, including
several haematological malignancies and androgen receptor-positive prostate
cancer. A-485 inhibited the androgen receptor transcriptional program in both
androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer and inhibited tumour 
growth in a castration-resistant xenograft model. These results demonstrate the
feasibility of using small molecule inhibitors to selectively target the
catalytic activity of histone acetyltransferases, which may provide effective
treatments for transcriptional activator-driven malignancies and diseases.

The ability to directly uncover the contributions of genes to a given phenotype
is fundamental for biology research. However, ostensibly homogeneous cell
populations exhibit large clonal variance that can confound analyses and
undermine reproducibility. Here we used genome-saturated mutagenesis to create a 
biobank of over 100,000 individual haploid mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell lines 
targeting 16,970 genes with genetically barcoded, conditional and reversible
mutations. This Haplobank is, to our knowledge, the largest resource of
hemi/homozygous mutant mES cells to date and is available to all researchers.
Reversible mutagenesis overcomes clonal variance by permitting functional
annotation of the genome directly in sister cells. We use the Haplobank in
reverse genetic screens to investigate the temporal resolution of essential genes
in mES cells, and to identify novel genes that control sprouting angiogenesis and
lineage specification of blood vessels. Furthermore, a genome-wide forward screen
with Haplobank identified PLA2G16 as a host factor that is required for
cytotoxicity by rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold. Therefore, clones from
the Haplobank combined with the use of reversible technologies enable
high-throughput, reproducible, functional annotation of the genome.

Catecholamine-induced lipolysis, the first step in the generation of energy
substrates by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, declines with age. The defect in
the mobilization of free fatty acids in the elderly is accompanied by increased
visceral adiposity, lower exercise capacity, failure to maintain core body
temperature during cold stress, and reduced ability to survive starvation.
Although catecholamine signalling in adipocytes is normal in the elderly, how
lipolysis is impaired in ageing remains unknown. Here we show that adipose tissue
macrophages regulate the age-related reduction in adipocyte lipolysis in mice by 
lowering the bioavailability of noradrenaline. Unexpectedly, unbiased
whole-transcriptome analyses of adipose macrophages revealed that ageing
upregulates genes that control catecholamine degradation in an NLRP3
inflammasome-dependent manner. Deletion of NLRP3 in ageing restored
catecholamine-induced lipolysis by downregulating growth differentiation factor-3
(GDF3) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) that is known to degrade noradrenaline.
Consistent with this, deletion of GDF3 in inflammasome-activated macrophages
improved lipolysis by decreasing levels of MAOA and caspase-1. Furthermore,
inhibition of MAOA reversed the age-related reduction in noradrenaline
concentration in adipose tissue, and restored lipolysis with increased levels of 
the key lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone
sensitive lipase (HSL). Our study reveals that targeting neuro-immunometabolic
signalling between the sympathetic nervous system and macrophages may offer new
approaches to mitigate chronic inflammation-induced metabolic impairment and
functional decline.

The tropical forests of Borneo and Amazonia may each contain more tree species
diversity in half a square kilometre than do all the temperate forests of Europe,
North America, and Asia combined. Biologists have long been fascinated by this
disparity, using it to investigate potential drivers of biodiversity. Latitudinal
variation in many of these drivers is expected to create geographic differences
in ecological and evolutionary processes, and evidence increasingly shows that
tropical ecosystems have higher rates of diversification, clade origination, and 
clade dispersal. However, there is currently no evidence to link gradients in
ecological processes within communities at a local scale directly to the
geographic gradient in biodiversity. Here, we show geographic variation in the
storage effect, an ecological mechanism that reduces the potential for
competitive exclusion more strongly in the tropics than it does in temperate and 
boreal zones, decreasing the ratio of interspecific-to-intraspecific competition 
by 0.25% for each degree of latitude that an ecosystem is located closer to the
Equator. Additionally, we find evidence that latitudinal variation in climate
underpins these differences; longer growing seasons in the tropics reduce
constraints on the seasonal timing of reproduction, permitting lower recruitment 
synchrony between species and thereby enhancing niche partitioning through the
storage effect. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the storage effect, 
and therefore its impact on diversity within communities, varies latitudinally in
association with climate. This finding highlights the importance of biotic
interactions in shaping geographic diversity patterns, and emphasizes the need to
understand the mechanisms underpinning ecological processes in greater detail
than has previously been appreciated.

Retrograde semaphorin-plexin signalling drives homeostatic synaptic plasticity.

Francisco, San Francisco, California 94158, USA.

Homeostatic signalling systems ensure stable but flexible neural activity and
animal behaviour. Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity is a conserved form of
neuronal homeostatic signalling that is observed in organisms ranging from
Drosophila to human. Defining the underlying molecular mechanisms of neuronal
homeostatic signalling will be essential in order to establish clear connections 
to the causes and progression of neurological disease. During neural development,
semaphorin-plexin signalling instructs axon guidance and neuronal morphogenesis. 
However, semaphorins and plexins are also expressed in the adult brain. Here we
show that semaphorin 2b (Sema2b) is a target-derived signal that acts upon
presynaptic plexin B (PlexB) receptors to mediate the retrograde, homeostatic
control of presynaptic neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction in 
Drosophila. Further, we show that Sema2b-PlexB signalling regulates presynaptic
homeostatic plasticity through the cytoplasmic protein Mical and the
oxoreductase-dependent control of presynaptic actin. We propose that
semaphorin-plexin signalling is an essential platform for the stabilization of
synaptic transmission throughout the developing and mature nervous system. These 
findings may be relevant to the aetiology and treatment of diverse neurological
and psychiatric diseases that are characterized by altered or inappropriate
neural function and behaviour.

De novo protein design holds promise for creating small stable proteins with
shapes customized to bind therapeutic targets. We describe a massively parallel
approach for designing, manufacturing and screening mini-protein binders,
integrating large-scale computational design, oligonucleotide synthesis, yeast
display screening and next-generation sequencing. We designed and tested 22,660
mini-proteins of 37-43 residues that target influenza haemagglutinin and
botulinum neurotoxin B, along with 6,286 control sequences to probe contributions
to folding and binding, and identified 2,618 high-affinity binders. Comparison of
the binding and non-binding design sets, which are two orders of magnitude larger
than any previously investigated, enabled the evaluation and improvement of the
computational model. Biophysical characterization of a subset of the binder
designs showed that they are extremely stable and, unlike antibodies, do not lose
activity after exposure to high temperatures. The designs elicit little or no
immune response and provide potent prophylactic and therapeutic protection
against influenza, even after extensive repeated dosing.

Cooperative binding, whereby an initial binding event facilitates the uptake of
additional substrate molecules, is common in biological systems such as
haemoglobin. It was recently shown that porous solids that exhibit cooperative
binding have substantial energetic benefits over traditional adsorbents, but few 
guidelines currently exist for the design of such materials. In principle,
metal-organic frameworks that contain coordinatively unsaturated metal centres
could act as both selective and cooperative adsorbents if guest binding at one
site were to trigger an electronic transformation that subsequently altered the
binding properties at neighbouring metal sites. Here we illustrate this concept
through the selective adsorption of carbon monoxide (CO) in a series of
metal-organic frameworks featuring coordinatively unsaturated iron(ii) sites.
Functioning via a mechanism by which neighbouring iron(ii) sites undergo a
spin-state transition above a threshold CO pressure, these materials exhibit
large CO separation capacities with only small changes in temperature. The very
low regeneration energies that result may enable more efficient Fischer-Tropsch
conversions and extraction of CO from industrial waste feeds, which currently
underutilize this versatile carbon synthon. The electronic basis for the
cooperative adsorption demonstrated here could provide a general strategy for
designing efficient and selective adsorbents suitable for various separations.

Recent advances in the use of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites for
optoelectronics have been rapid, with reported power conversion efficiencies of
up to 22 per cent for perovskite solar cells. Improvements in stability have also
enabled testing over a timescale of thousands of hours. However, large-scale
deployment of such cells will also require the ability to produce large-area,
uniformly high-quality perovskite films. A key challenge is to overcome the
substantial reduction in power conversion efficiency when a small device is
scaled up: a reduction from over 20 per cent to about 10 per cent is found when a
common aperture area of about 0.1 square centimetres is increased to more than 25
square centimetres. Here we report a new deposition route for methyl ammonium
lead halide perovskite films that does not rely on use of a common solvent or
vacuum: rather, it relies on the rapid conversion of amine complex precursors to 
perovskite films, followed by a pressure application step. The deposited
perovskite films were free of pin-holes and highly uniform. Importantly, the new 
deposition approach can be performed in air at low temperatures, facilitating
fabrication of large-area perovskite devices. We reached a certified power
conversion efficiency of 12.1 per cent with an aperture area of 36.1 square
centimetres for a mesoporous TiO2-based perovskite solar module architecture.

How type II CRISPR-Cas establish immunity through Cas1-Cas2-mediated spacer
integration.

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and the nearby
Cas (CRISPR-associated) operon establish an RNA-based adaptive immunity system in
prokaryotes. Molecular memory is created when a short foreign DNA-derived
prespacer is integrated into the CRISPR array as a new spacer. Whereas the
RNA-guided CRISPR interference mechanism varies widely among CRISPR-Cas systems, 
the spacer integration mechanism is essentially identical. The conserved Cas1 and
Cas2 proteins form an integrase complex consisting of two distal Cas1 dimers
bridged by a Cas2 dimer. The prespacer is bound by Cas1-Cas2 as a dual-forked
DNA, and the terminal 3'-OH of each 3' overhang serves as an attacking
nucleophile during integration. The prespacer is preferentially integrated into
the leader-proximal region of the CRISPR array, guided by the leader sequence and
a pair of inverted repeats inside the CRISPR repeat. Spacer integration in the
well-studied Escherichia coli type I-E CRISPR system also relies on the bacterial
integration host factor. In type II-A CRISPR, however, Cas1-Cas2 alone integrates
spacers efficiently in vitro; other Cas proteins (such as Cas9 and Csn2) have
accessory roles in the biogenesis phase of prespacers. Here we present four
structural snapshots from the type II-A system of Enterococcus faecalis Cas1 and 
Cas2 during spacer integration. Enterococcus faecalis Cas1-Cas2 selectively binds
to a splayed 30-base-pair prespacer bearing 4-nucleotide 3' overhangs. Three
molecular events take place upon encountering a target: first, the
Cas1-Cas2-prespacer complex searches for half-sites stochastically, then it
preferentially interacts with the leader-side CRISPR repeat, and finally, it
catalyses a nucleophilic attack that connects one strand of the leader-proximal
repeat to the prespacer 3' overhang. Recognition of the spacer half-site requires
DNA bending and leads to full integration. We derive a mechanistic framework to
explain the stepwise spacer integration process and the leader-proximal
preference.

In the design of industrial products ranging from hearing aids to automobiles and
aeroplanes, material is distributed so as to maximize the performance and
minimize the cost. Historically, human intuition and insight have driven the
evolution of mechanical design, recently assisted by computer-aided design
approaches. The computer-aided approach known as topology optimization enables
unrestricted design freedom and shows great promise with regard to weight
savings, but its applicability has so far been limited to the design of single
components or simple structures, owing to the resolution limits of current
optimization methods. Here we report a computational morphogenesis tool,
implemented on a supercomputer, that produces designs with giga-voxel
resolution-more than two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported.
Such resolution provides insights into the optimal distribution of material
within a structure that were hitherto unachievable owing to the challenges of
scaling up existing modelling and optimization frameworks. As an example, we
apply the tool to the design of the internal structure of a full-scale aeroplane 
wing. The optimized full-wing design has unprecedented structural detail at
length scales ranging from tens of metres to millimetres and, intriguingly, shows
remarkable similarity to naturally occurring bone structures in, for example,
bird beaks. We estimate that our optimized design corresponds to a reduction in
mass of 2-5 per cent compared to currently used aeroplane wing designs, which
translates into a reduction in fuel consumption of about 40-200 tonnes per year
per aeroplane. Our morphogenesis process is generally applicable, not only to
mechanical design, but also to flow systems, antennas, nano-optics and
micro-systems.

Nature uses a limited, conservative set of amino acids to synthesize proteins.
The ability to genetically encode an expanded set of building blocks with new
chemical and physical properties is transforming the study, manipulation and
evolution of proteins, and is enabling diverse applications, including approaches
to probe, image and control protein function, and to precisely engineer
therapeutics. Underpinning this transformation are strategies to engineer and
rewire translation. Emerging strategies aim to reprogram the genetic code so that
noncanonical biopolymers can be synthesized and evolved, and to test the limits
of our ability to engineer the translational machinery and systematically recode 
genomes.

Type Ia supernovae arise from the thermonuclear explosion of white-dwarf stars
that have cores of carbon and oxygen. The uniformity of their light curves makes 
these supernovae powerful cosmological distance indicators, but there have long
been debates about exactly how their explosion is triggered and what kind of
companion stars are involved. For example, the recent detection of the early
ultraviolet pulse of a peculiar, subluminous type Ia supernova has been claimed
as evidence for an interaction between a red-giant or a main-sequence companion
and ejecta from a white-dwarf explosion. Here we report observations of a
prominent but red optical flash that appears about half a day after the explosion
of a type Ia supernova. This supernova shows hybrid features of different
supernova subclasses, namely a light curve that is typical of normal-brightness
supernovae, but with strong titanium absorption, which is commonly seen in the
spectra of subluminous ones. We argue that this early flash does not occur
through previously suggested mechanisms such as the companion-ejecta interaction.
Instead, our simulations show that it could occur through detonation of a thin
helium shell either on a near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, or on a
sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf merging with a less-massive white dwarf. Our
finding provides evidence that one branch of previously proposed explosion
models-the helium-ignition branch-does exist in nature, and that such a model may
account for the explosions of white dwarfs in a mass range wider than previously 
supposed.

Medical X-ray imaging procedures require digital flat detectors operating at low 
doses to reduce radiation health risks. Solution-processed organic-inorganic
hybrid perovskites have characteristics that make them good candidates for the
photoconductive layer of such sensitive detectors. However, such detectors have
not yet been built on thin-film transistor arrays because it has been difficult
to prepare thick perovskite films (more than a few hundred micrometres) over
large areas (a detector is typically 50 centimetres by 50 centimetres). We report
here an all-solution-based (in contrast to conventional vacuum processing)
synthetic route to producing printable polycrystalline perovskites with sharply
faceted large grains having morphologies and optoelectronic properties comparable
to those of single crystals. High sensitivities of up to 11 microcoulombs per air
KERMA of milligray per square centimetre (μC mGyair-1 cm-2) are achieved under
irradiation with a 100-kilovolt bremsstrahlung source, which are at least one
order of magnitude higher than the sensitivities achieved with currently used
amorphous selenium or thallium-doped cesium iodide detectors. We demonstrate
X-ray imaging in a conventional thin-film transistor substrate by embedding an
830-micrometre-thick perovskite film and an additional two interlayers of
polymer/perovskite composites to provide conformal interfaces between perovskite 
films and electrodes that control dark currents and temporal charge carrier
transportation. Such an all-solution-based perovskite detector could enable
low-dose X-ray imaging, and could also be used in photoconductive devices for
radiation imaging, sensing and energy harvesting.

Climate changes are pronounced in Arctic regions and increase the vulnerability
of the Arctic coastal zone. For example, increases in melting of the Greenland
Ice Sheet and reductions in sea ice and permafrost distribution are likely to
alter coastal morphodynamics. The deltas of Greenland are largely unaffected by
human activity, but increased freshwater runoff and sediment fluxes may increase 
the size of the deltas, whereas increased wave activity in ice-free periods could
reduce their size, with the net impact being unclear until now. Here we show that
southwestern Greenland deltas were largely stable from the 1940s to 1980s, but
prograded (that is, sediment deposition extended the delta into the sea) in a
warming Arctic from the 1980s to 2010s. Our results are based on the areal
changes of 121 deltas since the 1940s, assessed using newly discovered aerial
photographs and remotely sensed imagery. We find that delta progradation was
driven by high freshwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet coinciding with
periods of open water. Progradation was controlled by the local initial
environmental conditions (that is, accumulated air temperatures above 0 °C per
year, freshwater runoff and sea ice in the 1980s) rather than by local changes in
these conditions from the 1980s to 2010s at each delta. This is in contrast to a 
dominantly eroding trend of Arctic sedimentary coasts along the coastal plains of
Alaska, Siberia and western Canada, and to the spatially variable patterns of
erosion and accretion along the large deltas of the main rivers in the Arctic.
Our results improve the understanding of Arctic coastal evolution in a changing
climate, and reveal the impacts on coastal areas of increasing ice mass loss and 
the associated freshwater runoff and lengthening of open-water periods.

High-grade gliomas (HGG) are a devastating group of cancers, and represent the
leading cause of brain tumour-related death in both children and adults.
Therapies aimed at mechanisms intrinsic to glioma cells have translated to only
limited success; effective therapeutic strategies will need also to target
elements of the tumour microenvironment that promote glioma progression. Neuronal
activity promotes the growth of a range of molecularly and clinically distinct
HGG types, including adult and paediatric glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic
oligodendroglioma, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). An important
mechanism that mediates this neural regulation of brain cancer is
activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic adhesion molecule
neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), which promotes glioma proliferation through the PI3K-mTOR
pathway. However, the necessity of NLGN3 for glioma growth, the proteolytic
mechanism of NLGN3 secretion, and the further molecular consequences of NLGN3
secretion in glioma cells remain unknown. Here we show that HGG growth depends on
microenvironmental NLGN3, identify signalling cascades downstream of NLGN3
binding in glioma, and determine a therapeutically targetable mechanism of
secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of paediatric GBM, DIPG and
adult GBM fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. NLGN3 stimulates several oncogenic
pathways, such as early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR,
and induces transcriptional changes that include upregulation of several
synapse-related genes in glioma cells. NLGN3 is cleaved from both neurons and
oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. ADAM10 inhibitors
prevent the release of NLGN3 into the tumour microenvironment and robustly block 
HGG xenograft growth. This work defines a promising strategy for targeting NLGN3 
secretion, which could prove transformative for HGG therapy.

Research on neuronal connectivity in the cerebral cortex has focused on the
existence and strength of synapses between neurons, and their location on the
cell bodies and dendrites of postsynaptic neurons. The synaptic architecture of
individual presynaptic axonal trees, however, remains largely unknown. Here we
used dense reconstructions from three-dimensional electron microscopy in rats to 
study the synaptic organization of local presynaptic axons in layer 2 of the
medial entorhinal cortex, the site of grid-like spatial representations. We
observe path-length-dependent axonal synapse sorting, such that axons of
excitatory neurons sequentially target inhibitory neurons followed by excitatory 
neurons. Connectivity analysis revealed a cellular feedforward inhibition circuit
involving wide, myelinated inhibitory axons and dendritic synapse clustering.
Simulations show that this high-precision circuit can control the propagation of 
synchronized activity in the medial entorhinal cortex, which is known for
temporally precise discharges.

In mammals, the canonical somatic DNA methylation landscape is established upon
specification of the embryo proper and subsequently disrupted within many cancer 
types. However, the underlying mechanisms that direct this genome-scale
transformation remain elusive, with no clear model for its systematic acquisition
or potential developmental utility. Here, we analysed global remethylation from
the mouse preimplantation embryo into the early epiblast and extraembryonic
ectoderm. We show that these two states acquire highly divergent genomic
distributions with substantial disruption of bimodal, CpG density-dependent
methylation in the placental progenitor. The extraembryonic epigenome includes
specific de novo methylation at hundreds of embryonically protected CpG island
promoters, particularly those that are associated with key developmental
regulators and are orthologously methylated across most human cancer types. Our
data suggest that the evolutionary innovation of extraembryonic tissues may have 
required co-option of DNA methylation-based suppression as an alternative to
regulation by Polycomb-group proteins, which coordinate embryonic germ-layer
formation in response to extraembryonic cues. Moreover, we establish that this
decision is made deterministically, downstream of promiscuously used-and
frequently oncogenic-signalling pathways, via a novel combination of epigenetic
cofactors. Methylation of developmental gene promoters during tumorigenesis may
therefore reflect the misappropriation of an innate trajectory and the
spontaneous reacquisition of a latent, developmentally encoded epigenetic
landscape.

The characterization of mutational processes that generate sequence diversity in 
the human genome is of paramount importance both to medical genetics and to
evolutionary studies. To understand how the age and sex of transmitting parents
affect de novo mutations, here we sequence 1,548 Icelanders, their parents, and, 
for a subset of 225, at least one child, to 35× genome-wide coverage. We find
108,778 de novo mutations, both single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels, and
determine the parent of origin of 42,961. The number of de novo mutations from
mothers increases by 0.37 per year of age (95% CI 0.32-0.43), a quarter of the
1.51 per year from fathers (95% CI 1.45-1.57). The number of clustered mutations 
increases faster with the mother's age than with the father's, and the genomic
span of maternal de novo mutation clusters is greater than that of paternal ones.
The types of de novo mutation from mothers change substantially with age, with a 
0.26% (95% CI 0.19-0.33%) decrease in cytosine-phosphate-guanine to
thymine-phosphate-guanine (CpG>TpG) de novo mutations and a 0.33% (95% CI
0.28-0.38%) increase in C>G de novo mutations per year, respectively. Remarkably,
these age-related changes are not distributed uniformly across the genome. A
striking example is a 20 megabase region on chromosome 8p, with a maternal C>G
mutation rate that is up to 50-fold greater than the rest of the genome. The
age-related accumulation of maternal non-crossover gene conversions also mostly
occurs within these regions. Increased sequence diversity and linkage
disequilibrium of C>G variants within regions affected by excess maternal
mutations indicate that the underlying mutational process has persisted in humans
for thousands of years. Moreover, the regional excess of C>G variation in humans 
is largely shared by chimpanzees, less by gorillas, and is almost absent from
orangutans. This demonstrates that sequence diversity in humans results from
evolving interactions between age, sex, mutation type, and genomic location.

Glycosylation, the covalent attachment of carbohydrate structures onto proteins, 
is the most abundant post-translational modification. Over 50% of human proteins 
are glycosylated, which alters their activities in diverse fundamental biological
processes. Despite the importance of glycosylation in biology, the identification
and functional validation of complex glycoproteins has remained largely
unexplored. Here we develop a novel quantitative approach to identify intact
glycopeptides from comparative proteomic data sets, allowing us not only to infer
complex glycan structures but also to directly map them to sites within the
associated proteins at the proteome scale. We apply this method to human and
mouse embryonic stem cells to illuminate the stem cell glycoproteome. This
analysis nearly doubles the number of experimentally confirmed glycoproteins,
identifies previously unknown glycosylation sites and multiple glycosylated
stemness factors, and uncovers evolutionarily conserved as well as
species-specific glycoproteins in embryonic stem cells. The specificity of our
method is confirmed using sister stem cells carrying repairable mutations in
enzymes required for fucosylation, Fut9 and Slc35c1. Ablation of fucosylation
confers resistance to the bioweapon ricin, and we discover proteins that carry a 
fucosylation-dependent sugar code for ricin toxicity. Mutations disrupting a
subset of these proteins render cells ricin resistant, revealing new players that
orchestrate ricin toxicity. Our comparative glycoproteomics platform, SugarQb,
enables genome-wide insights into protein glycosylation and glycan modifications 
in complex biological systems.

APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease.
ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology relative to other ApoE isoforms.
However, whether APOE independently influences tau pathology, the other major
proteinopathy of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated
neurodegeneration, is not clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on
either a human ApoE knock-in (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, here we show 
that P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the brain and a
greater extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution by three months of age
compared with P301S/E2, P301S/E3, and P301S/EKO mice. By nine months of age,
P301S mice with different ApoE genotypes display distinct phosphorylated tau
protein (p-tau) staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice develop markedly more brain
atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and P301S/E3 mice, whereas P301S/EKO 
mice are largely protected from these changes. In vitro, E4-expressing microglia 
exhibit higher innate immune reactivity after lipopolysaccharide treatment.
Co-culturing P301S tau-expressing neurons with E4-expressing mixed glia results
in a significantly higher level of tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion and
markedly reduced neuronal viability compared with neuron/E2 and neuron/E3
co-cultures. Neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest viability with
the lowest level of secreted TNF-α. Treatment of P301S neurons with recombinant
ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal damage and death compared with the 
absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 exacerbating the effect. In individuals with a
sporadic primary tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more 
severe regional neurodegeneration. In individuals who are positive for amyloid-β 
pathology with symptomatic Alzheimer disease who usually have tau pathology,
ε4-carriers demonstrate greater rates of disease progression. Our results
demonstrate that ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and
tau-mediated neurodegeneration independently of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 exerts
a 'toxic' gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is protective.

Maternal immune activation (MIA) contributes to behavioural abnormalities
associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in both primate and rodent
offspring. In humans, epidemiological studies suggest that exposure of fetuses to
maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of developing autism spectrum
disorder. In pregnant mice, interleukin-17a (IL-17a) produced by T helper 17
(TH17) cells (CD4+ T helper effector cells involved in multiple inflammatory
conditions) induces behavioural and cortical abnormalities in the offspring
exposed to MIA. However, it is unclear whether other maternal factors are
required to promote MIA-associated phenotypes. Moreover, the underlying
mechanisms by which MIA leads to T cell activation with increased IL-17a in the
maternal circulation are not well understood. Here we show that MIA phenotypes in
offspring require maternal intestinal bacteria that promote TH17 cell
differentiation. Pregnant mice that had been colonized with mouse commensal
segmented filamentous bacteria or human commensal bacteria that induce intestinal
TH17 cells were more likely to produce offspring with MIA-associated
abnormalities. We also show that small intestine dendritic cells from pregnant,
but not from non-pregnant, females secrete IL-1β, IL-23 and IL-6 and stimulate T 
cells to produce IL-17a upon exposure to MIA. Overall, our data suggest that
defined gut commensal bacteria with a propensity to induce TH17 cells may
increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring of pregnant
mothers undergoing immune system activation owing to infections or
autoinflammatory syndromes.

Pericyclic reactions-which proceed in a concerted fashion through a cyclic
transition state-are among the most powerful synthetic transformations used to
make multiple regioselective and stereoselective carbon-carbon bonds. They have
been widely applied to the synthesis of biologically active complex natural
products containing contiguous stereogenic carbon centres. Despite the prominence
of pericyclic reactions in total synthesis, only three naturally existing
enzymatic examples (the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction, and the Cope and the
Claisen rearrangements) have been characterized. Here we report a versatile
S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme, LepI, that can catalyse
stereoselective dehydration followed by three pericyclic transformations:
intramolecular Diels-Alder and hetero-Diels-Alder reactions via a single
ambimodal transition state, and a retro-Claisen rearrangement. Together, these
transformations lead to the formation of the dihydropyran core of the fungal
natural product, leporin. Combined in vitro enzymatic characterization and
computational studies provide insight into how LepI regulates these bifurcating
biosynthetic reaction pathways by using SAM as the cofactor. These pathways
converge to the desired biosynthetic end product via the (SAM-dependent)
retro-Claisen rearrangement catalysed by LepI. We expect that more pericyclic
biosynthetic enzymatic transformations remain to be discovered in naturally
occurring enzyme 'toolboxes'. The new role of the versatile cofactor SAM is
likely to be found in other examples of enzyme catalysis.

Viral infection during pregnancy is correlated with increased frequency of
neurodevelopmental disorders, and this is studied in mice prenatally subjected to
maternal immune activation (MIA). We previously showed that maternal T helper 17 
cells promote the development of cortical and behavioural abnormalities in
MIA-affected offspring. Here we show that cortical abnormalities are
preferentially localized to a region encompassing the dysgranular zone of the
primary somatosensory cortex (S1DZ). Moreover, activation of pyramidal neurons in
this cortical region was sufficient to induce MIA-associated behavioural
phenotypes in wild-type animals, whereas reduction in neural activity rescued the
behavioural abnormalities in MIA-affected offspring. Sociability and repetitive
behavioural phenotypes could be selectively modulated according to the efferent
targets of S1DZ. Our work identifies a cortical region primarily, if not
exclusively, centred on the S1DZ as the major node of a neural network that
mediates behavioural abnormalities observed in offspring exposed to maternal
inflammation.

Despite the versatility of synthetic chemistry, certain combinations of
mechanical softness, strength, and toughness can be difficult to achieve in a
single material. These combinations are, however, commonplace in biological
tissues, and are therefore needed for applications such as medical implants,
tissue engineering, soft robotics, and wearable electronics. Present materials
synthesis strategies are predominantly Edisonian, involving the empirical mixing 
of assorted monomers, crosslinking schemes, and occluded swelling agents, but
this approach yields limited property control. Here we present a general strategy
for mimicking the mechanical behaviour of biological materials by precisely
encoding their stress-strain curves in solvent-free brush- and comb-like polymer 
networks (elastomers). The code consists of three independent architectural
parameters-network strand length, side-chain length and grafting density. Using
prototypical poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomers, we illustrate how this parametric
triplet enables the replication of the strain-stiffening characteristics of
jellyfish, lung, and arterial tissues.

Stem-cell fate can be influenced by metabolite levels in culture, but it is not
known whether physiological variations in metabolite levels in normal tissues
regulate stem-cell function in vivo. Here we describe a metabolomics method for
the analysis of rare cell populations isolated directly from tissues and use it
to compare mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to restricted haematopoietic
progenitors. Each haematopoietic cell type had a distinct metabolic signature.
Human and mouse HSCs had unusually high levels of ascorbate, which decreased with
differentiation. Systemic ascorbate depletion in mice increased HSC frequency and
function, in part by reducing the function of Tet2, a dioxygenase tumour
suppressor. Ascorbate depletion cooperated with Flt3 internal tandem duplication 
(Flt3ITD) leukaemic mutations to accelerate leukaemogenesis, through
cell-autonomous and possibly non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, in a manner that was
reversed by dietary ascorbate. Ascorbate acted cell-autonomously to negatively
regulate HSC function and myelopoiesis through Tet2-dependent and
Tet2-independent mechanisms. Ascorbate therefore accumulates within HSCs to
promote Tet activity in vivo, limiting HSC frequency and suppressing
leukaemogenesis.

The silicate Earth is strongly depleted in moderately volatile elements (such as 
lead, zinc, indium and alkali elements) relative to CI chondrites, the meteorites
that compositionally most closely resemble the Sun. This depletion may be
explained qualitatively by accretion of 10 to 20 per cent of a volatile-rich body
to a reduced volatile-free proto-Earth, followed by partial extraction of some
elements to the core. However, there are several unanswered questions regarding
the sources of Earth's volatiles, notably the overabundance of indium in the
silicate Earth. Here we examine the melting processes that occurred during
accretion on Earth and precursor bodies and report vaporization experiments under
conditions of fixed temperature and oxygen fugacity. We find that the pattern of 
volatile element depletion in the silicate Earth is consistent with partial
melting and vaporization rather than with simple accretion of a volatile-rich
chondrite-like body. We argue that melting and vaporization on precursor bodies
and possibly during the giant Moon-forming impact were responsible for
establishing the observed abundances of moderately volatile elements in Earth.

The majority of the accreting supermassive black holes in the Universe are
obscured by large columns of gas and dust. The location and evolution of this
obscuring material have been the subject of intense research in the past decades,
and are still debated. A decrease in the covering factor of the circumnuclear
material with increasing accretion rates has been found by studies across the
electromagnetic spectrum. The origin of this trend may be driven by the increase 
in the inner radius of the obscuring material with incident luminosity, which
arises from the sublimation of dust; by the gravitational potential of the black 
hole; by radiative feedback; or by the interplay between outflows and inflows.
However, the lack of a large, unbiased and complete sample of accreting black
holes, with reliable information on gas column density, luminosity and mass, has 
left the main physical mechanism that regulates obscuration unclear. Here we
report a systematic multi-wavelength survey of hard-X-ray-selected black holes
that reveals that radiative feedback on dusty gas is the main physical mechanism 
that regulates the distribution of the circumnuclear material. Our results imply 
that the bulk of the obscuring dust and gas is located within a few to tens of
parsecs of the accreting supermassive black hole (within the sphere of influence 
of the black hole), and that it can be swept away even at low radiative output
rates. The main physical driver of the differences between obscured and
unobscured accreting black holes is therefore their mass-normalized accretion
rate.

It has long been recognized that Earth and other differentiated planetary bodies 
are chemically fractionated compared to primitive, chondritic meteorites and, by 
inference, the primordial disk from which they formed. However, it is not known
whether the notable volatile depletions of planetary bodies are a consequence of 
accretion or inherited from prior nebular fractionation. The isotopic
compositions of the main constituents of planetary bodies can contribute to this 
debate. Here we develop an analytical approach that corrects a major cause of
measurement inaccuracy inherent in conventional methods, and show that all
differentiated bodies have isotopically heavier magnesium compositions than
chondritic meteorites. We argue that possible magnesium isotope fractionation
during condensation of the solar nebula, core formation and silicate
differentiation cannot explain these observations. However, isotopic
fractionation between liquid and vapour, followed by vapour escape during
accretionary growth of planetesimals, generates appropriate residual
compositions. Our modelling implies that the isotopic compositions of magnesium, 
silicon and iron, and the relative abundances of the major elements of Earth and 
other planetary bodies, are a natural consequence of substantial (about 40 per
cent by mass) vapour loss from growing planetesimals by this mechanism.

Engineering and enhancing the breaking of inversion symmetry in solids-that is,
allowing electrons to differentiate between 'up' and 'down'-is a key goal in
condensed-matter physics and materials science because it can be used to
stabilize states that are of fundamental interest and also have potential
practical applications. Examples include improved ferroelectrics for memory
devices and materials that host Majorana zero modes for quantum computing.
Although inversion symmetry is naturally broken in several crystalline
environments, such as at surfaces and interfaces, maximizing the influence of
this effect on the electronic states of interest remains a challenge. Here we
present a mechanism for realizing a much larger coupling of inversion-symmetry
breaking to itinerant surface electrons than is typically achieved. The key
element is a pronounced asymmetry of surface hopping energies-that is, a
kinetic-energy-coupled inversion-symmetry breaking, the energy scale of which is 
a substantial fraction of the bandwidth. Using spin- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate that such a strong inversion-symmetry 
breaking, when combined with spin-orbit interactions, can mediate Rashba-like
spin splittings that are much larger than would typically be expected. The energy
scale of the inversion-symmetry breaking that we achieve is so large that the
spin splitting in the CoO2- and RhO2-derived surface states of delafossite oxides
becomes controlled by the full atomic spin-orbit coupling of the 3d and 4d
transition metals, resulting in some of the largest known Rashba-like spin
splittings. The core structural building blocks that facilitate the
bandwidth-scaled inversion-symmetry breaking are common to numerous materials.
Our findings therefore provide opportunities for creating spin-textured states
and suggest routes to interfacial control of inversion-symmetry breaking in
designer heterostructures of oxides and other material classes.

The vestiges of life in Eoarchean rocks have the potential to elucidate the
origin of life. However, gathering evidence from many terrains is not always
possible, and biogenic graphite has thus far been found only in the 3.7-3.8 Ga
(gigayears ago) Isua supracrustal belt. Here we present the total organic carbon 
contents and carbon isotope values of graphite (δ13Corg) and carbonate (δ13Ccarb)
in the oldest metasedimentary rocks from northern Labrador. Some pelitic rocks
have low δ13Corg values of -28.2, comparable to the lowest value in younger
rocks. The consistency between crystallization temperatures of the graphite and
metamorphic temperature of the host rocks establishes that the graphite does not 
originate from later contamination. A clear correlation between the δ13Corg
values and metamorphic grade indicates that variations in the δ13Corg values are 
due to metamorphism, and that the pre-metamorphic value was lower than the
minimum value. We concluded that the large fractionation between the δ13Ccarb and
δ13Corg values, up to 25‰, indicates the oldest evidence of organisms greater
than 3.95 Ga. The discovery of the biogenic graphite enables geochemical study of
the biogenic materials themselves, and will provide insight into early life not
only on Earth but also on other planets.

Constituting approximately 10% of flowering plant species, orchids (Orchidaceae) 
display unique flower morphologies, possess an extraordinary diversity in
lifestyle, and have successfully colonized almost every habitat on Earth. Here we
report the draft genome sequence of Apostasia shenzhenica, a representative of
one of two genera that form a sister lineage to the rest of the Orchidaceae,
providing a reference for inferring the genome content and structure of the most 
recent common ancestor of all extant orchids and improving our understanding of
their origins and evolution. In addition, we present transcriptome data for
representatives of Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae and Orchidoideae, and novel
third-generation genome data for two species of Epidendroideae, covering all five
orchid subfamilies. A. shenzhenica shows clear evidence of a whole-genome
duplication, which is shared by all orchids and occurred shortly before their
divergence. Comparisons between A. shenzhenica and other orchids and angiosperms 
also permitted the reconstruction of an ancestral orchid gene toolkit. We
identify new gene families, gene family expansions and contractions, and changes 
within MADS-box gene classes, which control a diverse suite of developmental
processes, during orchid evolution. This study sheds new light on the genetic
mechanisms underpinning key orchid innovations, including the development of the 
labellum and gynostemium, pollinia, and seeds without endosperm, as well as the
evolution of epiphytism; reveals relationships between the Orchidaceae
subfamilies; and helps clarify the evolutionary history of orchids within the
angiosperms.

Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) both contribute to mucosal homeostasis and
initiate pathologic inflammation in allergic asthma. However, the signals that
direct ILC2s to promote homeostasis versus inflammation are unclear. To identify 
such molecular cues, we profiled mouse lung-resident ILCs using single-cell RNA
sequencing at steady state and after in vivo stimulation with the alarmin
cytokines IL-25 and IL-33. ILC2s were transcriptionally heterogeneous after
activation, with subpopulations distinguished by expression of proliferative,
homeostatic and effector genes. The neuropeptide receptor Nmur1 was
preferentially expressed by ILC2s at steady state and after IL-25 stimulation.
Neuromedin U (NMU), the ligand of NMUR1, activated ILC2s in vitro, and in vivo
co-administration of NMU with IL-25 strongly amplified allergic inflammation.
Loss of NMU-NMUR1 signalling reduced ILC2 frequency and effector function, and
altered transcriptional programs following allergen challenge in vivo. Thus,
NMUR1 signalling promotes inflammatory ILC2 responses, highlighting the
importance of neuro-immune crosstalk in allergic inflammation at mucosal
surfaces.

Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular pathogens triggers a powerful innate
immune response. It is sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which elicits
the production of type I interferons by generating the second messenger
2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA can also be 
sensed by cGAS under certain conditions, resulting in sterile inflammation. The
cGAS dimer binds two DNA ligands shorter than 20 base pairs side-by-side, but
20-base-pair DNA fails to activate cGAS in vivo and is a poor activator in vitro.
Here we show that cGAS is activated in a strongly DNA length-dependent manner
both in vitro and in human cells. We also show that cGAS dimers form ladder-like 
networks with DNA, leading to cooperative sensing of DNA length: assembly of the 
pioneering cGAS dimer between two DNA molecules is ineffective; but, once formed,
it prearranges the flanking DNA to promote binding of subsequent cGAS dimers.
Remarkably, bacterial and mitochondrial nucleoid proteins HU and mitochondrial
transcription factor A (TFAM), as well as high-mobility group box 1 protein
(HMGB1), can strongly stimulate long DNA sensing by cGAS. U-turns and bends in
DNA induced by these proteins pre-structure DNA to nucleate cGAS dimers. Our
results suggest a nucleation-cooperativity-based mechanism for sensitive
detection of mitochondrial DNA and pathogen genomes, and identify HMGB/TFAM
proteins as DNA-structuring host factors. They provide an explanation for the
peculiar cGAS dimer structure and suggest that cGAS preferentially binds
incomplete nucleoid-like structures or bent DNA.

Human transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is part of the general transcriptional
machinery required by RNA polymerase II for the initiation of eukaryotic gene
transcription. Composed of ten subunits that add up to a molecular mass of about 
500 kDa, TFIIH is also essential for nucleotide excision repair. The
seven-subunit TFIIH core complex formed by XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8
is competent for DNA repair, while the CDK-activating kinase subcomplex, which
includes the kinase activity of CDK7 as well as the cyclin H and MAT1 subunits,
is additionally required for transcription initiation. Mutations in the TFIIH
subunits XPB, XPD, and p8 lead to severe premature ageing and cancer propensity
in the genetic diseases xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and
trichothiodystrophy, highlighting the importance of TFIIH for cellular
physiology. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TFIIH
at 4.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals the molecular architecture of the
TFIIH core complex, the detailed structures of its constituent XPB and XPD
ATPases, and how the core and kinase subcomplexes of TFIIH are connected.
Additionally, our structure provides insight into the conformational dynamics of 
TFIIH and the regulation of its activity.

    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2017 Nov;18(11):642.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission has long been
considered a cellular correlate for learning and memory. Early LTP (less than
1 h) had initially been explained either by presynaptic increases in glutamate
release or by direct modification of postsynaptic AMPA
(α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor function.
Compelling models have more recently proposed that synaptic potentiation can
occur by the recruitment of additional postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs),
sourced either from an intracellular reserve pool by exocytosis or from nearby
extra-synaptic receptors pre-existing on the neuronal surface. However, the exact
mechanism through which synapses can rapidly recruit new AMPARs during early LTP 
remains unknown. In particular, direct evidence for a pivotal role of AMPAR
surface diffusion as a trafficking mechanism in synaptic plasticity is still
lacking. Here, using AMPAR immobilization approaches, we show that interfering
with AMPAR surface diffusion markedly impairs synaptic potentiation of Schaffer
collaterals and commissural inputs to the CA1 area of the mouse hippocampus in
cultured slices, acute slices and in vivo. Our data also identify distinct
contributions of various AMPAR trafficking routes to the temporal profile of
synaptic potentiation. In addition, AMPAR immobilization in vivo in the dorsal
hippocampus inhibited fear conditioning, indicating that AMPAR diffusion is
important for the early phase of contextual learning. Therefore, our results
provide a direct demonstration that the recruitment of new receptors to synapses 
by surface diffusion is a critical mechanism for the expression of LTP and
hippocampal learning. Since AMPAR surface diffusion is dictated by weak Brownian 
forces that are readily perturbed by protein-protein interactions, we anticipate 
that this fundamental trafficking mechanism will be a key target for modulating
synaptic potentiation and learning.

To understand why molecular evolution turned out as it did, we must characterize 
not only the path that evolution followed across the space of possible molecular 
sequences but also the many alternative trajectories that could have been taken
but were not. A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would
establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by 
natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events; it would
also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space
shaped historical evolution. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction
with deep mutational scanning to characterize alternative histories in the
sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel
biological function through well-characterized mechanisms. We find hundreds of
alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform 
the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These
alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the
derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred
during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting
point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes
with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this
contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space
and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast
space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the 
outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events.

Identification of neural circuit changes that contribute to behavioural
plasticity has routinely been conducted on candidate circuits that were
preselected on the basis of previous results. Here we present an unbiased method 
for identifying experience-triggered circuit-level changes in neuronal ensembles 
in mice. Using rabies virus monosynaptic tracing, we mapped cocaine-induced
global changes in inputs onto neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Cocaine
increased rabies-labelled inputs from the globus pallidus externus (GPe), a basal
ganglia nucleus not previously known to participate in behavioural plasticity
triggered by drugs of abuse. We demonstrated that cocaine increased GPe neuron
activity, which accounted for the increase in GPe labelling. Inhibition of GPe
activity revealed that it contributes to two forms of cocaine-triggered
behavioural plasticity, at least in part by disinhibiting dopamine neurons in the
ventral tegmental area. These results suggest that rabies-based unbiased
screening of changes in input populations can identify previously unappreciated
circuit elements that critically support behavioural adaptations.

The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor, has a crucial
role in human and mouse pigmentation. Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by
α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) stimulates cAMP signalling and melanin
production and enhances DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation. Individuals
carrying MC1R variants, especially those associated with red hair colour, fair
skin and poor tanning ability (denoted as RHC variants), are associated with
higher risk of melanoma. However, how MC1R activity is modulated by ultraviolet
irradiation, why individuals with red hair are more prone to developing melanoma,
and whether the activity of RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic
benefit are unknown. Here we demonstrate a potential MC1R-targeted intervention
strategy in mice to rescue loss-of-function MC1R in MC1R RHC variants for
therapeutic benefit by activating MC1R protein palmitoylation. MC1R
palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is
essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, 
ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and
melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using C57BL/6J-Mc1re/eJ mice, in which
endogenous MC1R is prematurely terminated, expressing Mc1r RHC variants, we show 
that pharmacological activation of palmitoylation rescues the defects of Mc1r RHC
variants and prevents melanomagenesis. The results highlight a central role for
MC1R palmitoylation in pigmentation and protection against melanoma.

Regulation of cell proliferation is necessary for immune responses, tissue
repair, and upkeep of organ function to maintain human health. When proliferating
cells complete mitosis, a fraction of newly born daughter cells immediately enter
the next cell cycle, while the remaining cells in the same population exit to a
transient or persistent quiescent state. Whether this choice between two
cell-cycle pathways is due to natural variability in mitogen signalling or other 
underlying causes is unknown. Here we show that human cells make this fundamental
cell-cycle entry or exit decision based on competing memories of variable mitogen
and stress signals. Rather than erasing their signalling history at cell-cycle
checkpoints before mitosis, mother cells transmit DNA damage-induced p53 protein 
and mitogen-induced cyclin D1 (CCND1) mRNA to newly born daughter cells. After
mitosis, the transferred CCND1 mRNA and p53 protein induce variable expression of
cyclin D1 and the CDK inhibitor p21 that almost exclusively determines cell-cycle
commitment in daughter cells. We find that stoichiometric inhibition of cyclin
D1-CDK4 activity by p21 controls the retinoblastoma (Rb) and E2F transcription
program in an ultrasensitive manner. Thus, daughter cells control the
proliferation-quiescence decision by converting the memories of variable mitogen 
and stress signals into a competition between cyclin D1 and p21 expression. We
propose a cell-cycle control principle based on natural variation, memory and
competition that maximizes the health of growing cell populations.

The pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases is poorly understood and there 
are few therapeutic options. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by
progressive neuronal dysfunction and loss, and chronic glial activation. Whether 
microglial activation, which is generally viewed as a secondary process, is
harmful or protective in neurodegeneration remains unclear. Late-onset
neurodegenerative disease observed in patients with histiocytoses, which are
clonal myeloid diseases associated with somatic mutations in the RAS-MEK-ERK
pathway such as BRAF(V600E), suggests a possible role of somatic mutations in
myeloid cells in neurodegeneration. Yet the expression of BRAF(V600E) in the
haematopoietic stem cell lineage causes leukaemic and tumoural diseases but not
neurodegenerative disease. Microglia belong to a lineage of adult tissue-resident
myeloid cells that develop during organogenesis from yolk-sac erythro-myeloid
progenitors (EMPs) distinct from haematopoietic stem cells. We therefore
hypothesized that a somatic BRAF(V600E) mutation in the EMP lineage may cause
neurodegeneration. Here we show that mosaic expression of BRAF(V600E) in mouse
EMPs results in clonal expansion of tissue-resident macrophages and a severe
late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. This is associated with accumulation of
ERK-activated amoeboid microglia in mice, and is also observed in human patients 
with histiocytoses. In the mouse model, neurobehavioural signs, astrogliosis,
deposition of amyloid precursor protein, synaptic loss and neuronal death were
driven by ERK-activated microglia and were preventable by BRAF inhibition. These 
results identify the fetal precursors of tissue-resident macrophages as a
potential cell-of-origin for histiocytoses and demonstrate that a somatic
mutation in the EMP lineage in mice can drive late-onset neurodegeneration.
Moreover, these data identify activation of the MAP kinase pathway in microglia
as a cause of neurodegeneration and this offers opportunities for therapeutic
intervention aimed at the prevention of neuronal death in neurodegenerative
diseases.

Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.

Actuators that convert electrical energy to mechanical energy are useful in a
wide variety of electromechanical systems and in robotics, with applications such
as steerable catheters, adaptive wings for aircraft and drag-reducing wind
turbines. Actuation systems can be based on various stimuli, such as heat,
solvent adsorption/desorption, or electrochemical action (in systems such as
carbon nanotube electrodes, graphite electrodes, polymer electrodes and metals). 
Here we demonstrate that the dynamic expansion and contraction of electrode films
formed by restacking chemically exfoliated nanosheets of two-dimensional metallic
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) on thin plastic substrates can generate substantial
mechanical forces. These films are capable of lifting masses that are more than
150 times that of the electrode over several millimetres and for hundreds of
cycles. Specifically, the MoS2 films are able to generate mechanical stresses of 
about 17 megapascals-higher than mammalian muscle (about 0.3 megapascals) and
comparable to ceramic piezoelectric actuators (about 40 megapascals)-and strains 
of about 0.6 per cent, operating at frequencies up to 1 hertz. The actuation
performance is attributed to the high electrical conductivity of the metallic 1T 
phase of MoS2 nanosheets, the elastic modulus of restacked MoS2 layers (2 to 4
gigapascals) and fast proton diffusion between the nanosheets. These results
could lead to new electrochemical actuators for high-strain and high-frequency
applications.

Classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ) and homologous recombination compete
for the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks during the cell cycle. Homologous
recombination is inhibited during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but both
pathways are active in the S and G2 phases. However, it is unclear why cNHEJ does
not always outcompete homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases. Here
we show that CYREN (cell cycle regulator of NHEJ) is a cell-cycle-specific
inhibitor of cNHEJ. Suppression of CYREN allows cNHEJ to occur at telomeres and
intrachromosomal breaks during the S and G2 phases, and cells lacking CYREN
accumulate chromosomal aberrations upon damage induction, specifically outside
the G1 phase. CYREN acts by binding to the Ku70/80 heterodimer and preferentially
inhibits cNHEJ at breaks with overhangs by protecting them. We therefore propose 
that CYREN is a direct cell-cycle-dependent inhibitor of cNHEJ that promotes
error-free repair by homologous recombination during cell cycle phases when
sister chromatids are present.

layer by layer increases design freedom and manufacturing flexibility, thereby
enabling complex geometries, increased product customization and shorter time to 
market, while eliminating traditional economy-of-scale constraints. However,
currently only a few alloys, the most relevant being AlSi10Mg, TiAl6V4, CoCr and 
Inconel 718, can be reliably printed; the vast majority of the more than 5,500
alloys in use today cannot be additively manufactured because the melting and
solidification dynamics during the printing process lead to intolerable
microstructures with large columnar grains and periodic cracks. Here we
demonstrate that these issues can be resolved by introducing nanoparticles of
nucleants that control solidification during additive manufacturing. We selected 
the nucleants on the basis of crystallographic information and assembled them
onto 7075 and 6061 series aluminium alloy powders. After functionalization with
the nucleants, we found that these high-strength aluminium alloys, which were
previously incompatible with additive manufacturing, could be processed
successfully using selective laser melting. Crack-free, equiaxed (that is, with
grains roughly equal in length, width and height), fine-grained microstructures
were achieved, resulting in material strengths comparable to that of wrought
material. Our approach to metal-based additive manufacturing is applicable to a
wide range of alloys and can be implemented using a range of additive machines.
It thus provides a foundation for broad industrial applicability, including where
electron-beam melting or directed-energy-deposition techniques are used instead
of selective laser melting, and will enable additive manufacturing of other alloy
systems, such as non-weldable nickel superalloys and intermetallics. Furthermore,
this technology could be used in conventional processing such as in joining,
casting and injection moulding, in which solidification cracking and hot tearing 
are also common issues.

It has been convincingly argued that molecular machines that manipulate
individual atoms, or highly reactive clusters of atoms, with Ångström precision
are unlikely to be realized. However, biological molecular machines routinely
position rather less reactive substrates in order to direct chemical reaction
sequences, from sequence-specific synthesis by the ribosome to polyketide
synthases, where tethered molecules are passed from active site to active site in
multi-enzyme complexes. Artificial molecular machines have been developed for
tasks that include sequence-specific oligomer synthesis and the switching of
product chirality, a photo-responsive host molecule has been described that is
able to mechanically twist a bound molecular guest, and molecular fragments have 
been selectively transported in either direction between sites on a molecular
platform through a ratchet mechanism. Here we detail an artificial molecular
machine that moves a substrate between different activating sites to achieve
different product outcomes from chemical synthesis. This molecular robot can be
programmed to stereoselectively produce, in a sequential one-pot operation, an
excess of any one of four possible diastereoisomers from the addition of a thiol 
and an alkene to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in a tandem reaction process. The
stereodivergent synthesis includes diastereoisomers that cannot be selectively
synthesized through conventional iminium-enamine organocatalysis. We anticipate
that future generations of programmable molecular machines may have significant
roles in chemical synthesis and molecular manufacturing.

Asteroids are primitive Solar System bodies that evolve both collisionally and
through disruptions arising from rapid rotation. These processes can lead to the 
formation of binary asteroids and to the release of dust, both directly and, in
some cases, through uncovering frozen volatiles. In a subset of the asteroids
called main-belt comets, the sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient 
comet-like activity. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin
rates of active comets and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei. 
The kilometre-sized main-belt asteroid 288P (300163) showed activity for several 
months around its perihelion 2011 (ref. 11), suspected to be sustained by the
sublimation of water ice and supported by rapid rotation, while at least one
component rotates slowly with a period of 16 hours (ref. 14). The object 288P is 
part of a young family of at least 11 asteroids that formed from a precursor
about 10 kilometres in diameter during a shattering collision 7.5 million years
ago. Here we report that 288P is a binary main-belt comet. It is different from
the known asteroid binaries in its combination of wide separation, near-equal
component size, high eccentricity and comet-like activity. The observations also 
provide strong support for sublimation as the driver of activity in 288P and show
that sublimation torques may play an important part in binary orbit evolution.

Non-Abelian anyons are a type of quasiparticle with the potential to encode
quantum information in topological qubits protected from decoherence.
Experimental systems that are predicted to harbour non-Abelian anyons include
p-wave superfluids, superconducting systems with strong spin-orbit coupling, and 
paired states of interacting composite fermions that emerge at even denominators 
in the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) regime. Although even-denominator FQH states
have been observed in several two-dimensional systems, small energy gaps and
limited tunability have stymied definitive experimental probes of their
non-Abelian nature. Here we report the observation of robust even-denominator FQH
phases at half-integer Landau-level filling in van der Waals heterostructures
consisting of dual-gated, hexagonal-boron-nitride-encapsulated bilayer graphene. 
The measured energy gap is three times larger than observed previously. We
compare these FQH phases with numerical and theoretical models while
simultaneously controlling the carrier density, layer polarization and magnetic
field, and find evidence for the paired Pfaffian phase that is predicted to host 
non-Abelian anyons. Electric-field-controlled level crossings between states with
different Landau-level indices reveal a cascade of FQH phase transitions,
including a continuous phase transition between the even-denominator FQH state
and a compressible composite fermion liquid. Our results establish graphene as a 
pristine and tunable experimental platform for studying the interplay between
topology and quantum criticality, and for detecting non-Abelian qubits.

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) regulate inflammation, tissue repair and
metabolic homeostasis, and are activated by host-derived cytokines and alarmins. 
Discrete subsets of immune cells integrate nervous system cues, but it remains
unclear whether neuron-derived signals control ILC2s. Here we show that
neuromedin U (NMU) in mice is a fast and potent regulator of type 2 innate
immunity in the context of a functional neuron-ILC2 unit. We found that ILC2s
selectively express neuromedin U receptor 1 (Nmur1), and mucosal neurons express 
NMU. Cell-autonomous activation of ILC2s with NMU resulted in immediate and
strong NMUR1-dependent production of innate inflammatory and tissue repair
cytokines. NMU controls ILC2s downstream of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
and calcium-influx-dependent activation of both calcineurin and nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT). NMU treatment in vivo resulted in immediate protective 
type 2 responses. Accordingly, ILC2-autonomous ablation of Nmur1 led to impaired 
type 2 responses and poor control of worm infection. Notably, mucosal neurons
were found adjacent to ILC2s, and these neurons directly sensed worm products and
alarmins to induce NMU and to control innate type 2 cytokines. Our work reveals
that neuron-ILC2 cell units confer immediate tissue protection through
coordinated neuroimmune sensory responses.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been identified as the most abundant modification on
eukaryote messenger RNA (mRNA). Although the rapid development of high-throughput
sequencing technologies has enabled insight into the biological functions of m6A 
modification, the function of m6A during vertebrate embryogenesis remains poorly 
understood. Here we show that m6A determines cell fate during the
endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) to specify the earliest
haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) during zebrafish embryogenesis.
m6A-specific methylated RNA immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput
sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and
immunoprecipitation with sequencing (miCLIP-seq) analyses reveal conserved
features on zebrafish m6A methylome and preferential distribution of m6A peaks
near the stop codon with a consensus RRACH motif. In mettl3-deficient embryos,
levels of m6A are significantly decreased and emergence of HSPCs is blocked.
Mechanistically, we identify that the delayed YTHDF2-mediated mRNA decay of the
arterial endothelial genes notch1a and rhoca contributes to this deleterious
effect. The continuous activation of Notch signalling in arterial endothelial
cells of mettl3-deficient embryos blocks EHT, thereby repressing the generation
of the earliest HSPCs. Furthermore, knockdown of Mettl3 in mice confers a similar
phenotype. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the critical function of m6A
modification in the fate determination of HSPCs during vertebrate embryogenesis.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is
critical for the assembly of their cell envelopes. LPS synthesized in the
cytoplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane is flipped to the periplasmic leaflet
by MsbA, an ATP-binding cassette transporter. Despite substantial efforts, the
structural mechanisms underlying MsbA-driven LPS flipping remain elusive. Here we
use single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the structures of
lipid-nanodisc-embedded MsbA in three functional states. The 4.2 Å-resolution
structure of the transmembrane domains of nucleotide-free MsbA reveals that LPS
binds deep inside MsbA at the height of the periplasmic leaflet, establishing
extensive hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with MsbA. Two
sub-nanometre-resolution structures of MsbA with ADP-vanadate and ADP reveal an
unprecedented closed and an inward-facing conformation, respectively. Our study
uncovers the structural basis for LPS recognition, delineates the conformational 
transitions of MsbA to flip LPS, and paves the way for structural
characterization of other lipid flippases.

The Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mainly mediates transcriptional
repression and has essential roles in various biological processes including the 
maintenance of cell identity and proper differentiation. Polycomb-like (PCL)
proteins, such as PHF1, MTF2 and PHF19, are PRC2-associated factors that form
sub-complexes with PRC2 core components, and have been proposed to modulate the
enzymatic activity of PRC2 or the recruitment of PRC2 to specific genomic loci.
Mammalian PRC2-binding sites are enriched in CG content, which correlates with
CpG islands that display a low level of DNA methylation. However, the mechanism
of PRC2 recruitment to CpG islands is not fully understood. Here we solve the
crystal structures of the N-terminal domains of PHF1 and MTF2 with bound
CpG-containing DNAs in the presence of H3K36me3-containing histone peptides. We
show that the extended homologous regions of both proteins fold into a
winged-helix structure, which specifically binds to the unmethylated CpG motif
but in a completely different manner from the canonical winged-helix DNA
recognition motif. We also show that the PCL extended homologous domains are
required for efficient recruitment of PRC2 to CpG island-containing promoters in 
mouse embryonic stem cells. Our research provides the first, to our knowledge,
direct evidence to demonstrate that PCL proteins are crucial for PRC2 recruitment
to CpG islands, and further clarifies the roles of these proteins in
transcriptional regulation in vivo.

The type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 have important
roles in stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses that are required for
resistance to helminth infection, promotion of allergic inflammation, metabolic
homeostasis and tissue repair. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) produce type
2 cytokines, and although advances have been made in understanding the cytokine
milieu that promotes ILC2 responses, how ILC2 responses are regulated by other
stimuli remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that ILC2s in the mouse
gastrointestinal tract co-localize with cholinergic neurons that express the
neuropeptide neuromedin U (NMU). In contrast to other haematopoietic cells, ILC2s
selectively express the NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1). In vitro stimulation of ILC2s
with NMU induced rapid cell activation, proliferation, and secretion of the type 
2 cytokines IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 that was dependent on cell-intrinsic expression 
of NMUR1 and Gαq protein. In vivo administration of NMU triggered potent type 2
cytokine responses characterized by ILC2 activation, proliferation and eosinophil
recruitment that was associated with accelerated expulsion of the
gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis or induction of lung
inflammation. Conversely, worm burden was higher in Nmur1-/- mice than in control
mice. Furthermore, use of gene-deficient mice and adoptive cell transfer
experiments revealed that ILC2s were necessary and sufficient to mount
NMU-elicited type 2 cytokine responses. Together, these data indicate that the
NMU-NMUR1 neuronal signalling circuit provides a selective mechanism through
which the enteric nervous system and innate immune system integrate to promote
rapid type 2 cytokine responses that can induce anti-microbial, inflammatory and 
tissue-protective type 2 responses at mucosal sites.

More than 500 controlled experiments have collectively suggested that
biodiversity loss reduces ecosystem productivity and stability. Yet the
importance of biodiversity in sustaining the world's ecosystems remains
controversial, largely because of the lack of validation in nature, where strong 
abiotic forcing and complex interactions are assumed to swamp biodiversity
effects. Here we test this assumption by analysing 133 estimates reported in 67
field studies that statistically separated the effects of biodiversity on biomass
production from those of abiotic forcing. Contrary to the prevailing opinion of
the previous two decades that biodiversity would have rare or weak effects in
nature, we show that biomass production increases with species richness in a wide
range of wild taxa and ecosystems. In fact, after controlling for environmental
covariates, increases in biomass with biodiversity are stronger in nature than
has previously been documented in experiments and comparable to or stronger than 
the effects of other well-known drivers of productivity, including climate and
nutrient availability. These results are consistent with the collective
experimental evidence that species richness increases community biomass
production, and suggest that the role of biodiversity in maintaining productive
ecosystems should figure prominently in global change science and policy.

Modern ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) comprise half of extant vertebrate
species and are widely thought to have originated before or near the end of the
Middle Devonian epoch (around 385 million years ago). Polypterids (bichirs and
ropefish) represent the earliest-diverging lineage of living actinopterygians,
with almost all Palaeozoic taxa interpreted as more closely related to other
extant actinopterygians than to polypterids. By contrast, the earliest material
assigned to the polypterid lineage is mid-Cretaceous in age (around 100 million
years old), implying a quarter-of-a-billion-year palaeontological gap. Here we
show that scanilepiforms, a widely distributed radiation from the Triassic period
(around 252-201 million years ago), are stem polypterids. Importantly, these
fossils break the long polypterid branch and expose many supposedly primitive
features of extant polypterids as reversals. This shifts numerous Palaeozoic
ray-fins to the actinopterygian stem, reducing the minimum age for the crown
lineage by roughly 45 million years. Recalibration of molecular clocks to exclude
phylogenetically reassigned Palaeozoic taxa results in estimates that the
actinopterygian crown lineage is about 20-40 million years younger than was
indicated by previous molecular analyses. These new dates are broadly consistent 
with our revised palaeontological timescale and coincident with an interval of
conspicuous morphological and taxonomic diversification among ray-fins centred on
the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. A shifting timescale, combined with
ambiguity in the relationships of late Palaeozoic actinopterygians, highlights
this part of the fossil record as a major frontier in understanding the
evolutionary assembly of modern vertebrate diversity.

Human glioblastomas harbour a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells that drive
tumorigenesis. However, the origin of intratumoural functional heterogeneity
between glioblastoma cells remains poorly understood. Here we study the clonal
evolution of barcoded glioblastoma cells in an unbiased way following serial
xenotransplantation to define their individual fate behaviours. Independent of an
evolving mutational signature, we show that the growth of glioblastoma clones in 
vivo is consistent with a remarkably neutral process involving a conserved
proliferative hierarchy rooted in glioblastoma stem cells. In this model,
slow-cycling stem-like cells give rise to a more rapidly cycling progenitor
population with extensive self-maintenance capacity, which in turn generates
non-proliferative cells. We also identify rare 'outlier' clones that deviate from
these dynamics, and further show that chemotherapy facilitates the expansion of
pre-existing drug-resistant glioblastoma stem cells. Finally, we show that
functionally distinct glioblastoma stem cells can be separately targeted using
epigenetic compounds, suggesting new avenues for glioblastoma-targeted therapy.

Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) via nitrite (NO2-) to nitrate
(NO3-), is a key process of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. For decades,
ammonia and nitrite oxidation were thought to be separately catalysed by
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), and by nitrite-oxidizing
bacteria (NOB). The recent discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) in 
the NOB genus Nitrospira, which alone convert ammonia to nitrate, raised
questions about the ecological niches in which comammox Nitrospira successfully
compete with canonical nitrifiers. Here we isolate a pure culture of a comammox
bacterium, Nitrospira inopinata, and show that it is adapted to slow growth in
oligotrophic and dynamic habitats on the basis of a high affinity for ammonia,
low maximum rate of ammonia oxidation, high growth yield compared to canonical
nitrifiers, and genomic potential for alternative metabolisms. The nitrification 
kinetics of four AOA from soil and hot springs were determined for comparison.
Their surprisingly poor substrate affinities and lower growth yields reveal that,
in contrast to earlier assumptions, AOA are not necessarily the most competitive 
ammonia oxidizers present in strongly oligotrophic environments and that N.
inopinata has the highest substrate affinity of all analysed ammonia oxidizer
isolates except the marine AOA Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1 (ref. 3). These
results suggest a role for comammox organisms in nitrification under oligotrophic
and dynamic conditions.

Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning
techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Quantum
systems produce atypical patterns that classical systems are thought not to
produce efficiently, so it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may 
outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum
machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that could
enable machine learning that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent
work has produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of
machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are still
considerable.

Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and
problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated
as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing 
high-performance computers. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically 
has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system,
and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These
limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom
electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized
quantum computers. Yet experimental implementations have so far been restricted
to molecules involving only hydrogen and helium. Here we demonstrate the
experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more 
than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the ground-state energy for molecules
of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational
quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial states
that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our
quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and
a robust stochastic optimization routine. We demonstrate the flexibility of our
approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement
between our experiments and numerical simulations using a model of the device
with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method
to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in
high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.

The field of quantum algorithms aims to find ways to speed up the solution of
computational problems by using a quantum computer. A key milestone in this field
will be when a universal quantum computer performs a computational task that is
beyond the capability of any classical computer, an event known as quantum
supremacy. This would be easier to achieve experimentally than full-scale quantum
computing, but involves new theoretical challenges. Here we present the leading
proposals to achieve quantum supremacy, and discuss how we can reliably compare
the power of a classical computer to the power of a quantum computer.

Quantum computing sits at an important inflection point. For years, high-level
algorithms for quantum computers have shown considerable promise, and recent
advances in quantum device fabrication offer hope of utility. A gap still exists,
however, between the hardware size and reliability requirements of quantum
computing algorithms and the physical machines foreseen within the next ten
years. To bridge this gap, quantum computers require appropriate software to
translate and optimize applications (toolflows) and abstraction layers. Given the
stringent resource constraints in quantum computing, information passed between
layers of software and implementations will differ markedly from in classical
computing. Quantum toolflows must expose more physical details between layers, so
the challenge is to find abstractions that expose key details while hiding enough
complexity.

A practical quantum computer must not merely store information, but also process 
it. To prevent errors introduced by noise from multiplying and spreading, a
fault-tolerant computational architecture is required. Current experiments are
taking the first steps toward noise-resilient logical qubits. But to convert
these quantum devices from memories to processors, it is necessary to specify how
a universal set of gates is performed on them. The leading proposals for doing
so, such as magic-state distillation and colour-code techniques, have high
resource demands. Alternative schemes, such as those that use high-dimensional
quantum codes in a modular architecture, have potential benefits, but need to be 
explored further.

As a result of the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its amendments, the atmospheric
loading of anthropogenic ozone-depleting substances is decreasing. Accordingly,
the stratospheric ozone layer is expected to recover. However, short data records
and atmospheric variability confound the search for early signs of recovery, and 
climate change is masking ozone recovery from ozone-depleting substances in some 
regions and will increasingly affect the extent of recovery. Here we discuss the 
nature and timescales of ozone recovery, and explore the extent to which it can
be currently detected in different atmospheric regions.

Glaciers in the high mountains of Asia (HMA) make a substantial contribution to
the water supply of millions of people, and they are retreating and losing mass
as a result of anthropogenic climate change at similar rates to those seen
elsewhere. In the Paris Agreement of 2015, 195 nations agreed on the aspiration
to limit the level of global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius ( °C) above 
pre-industrial levels. However, it is not known what an increase of 1.5 °C would 
mean for the glaciers in HMA. Here we show that a global temperature rise of
1.5 °C will lead to a warming of 2.1 ± 0.1 °C in HMA, and that 64 ± 7 per cent of
the present-day ice mass stored in the HMA glaciers will remain by the end of the
century. The 1.5 °C goal is extremely ambitious and is projected by only a small 
number of climate models of the conservative IPCC's Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP)2.6 ensemble. Projections for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 reveal that 
much of the glacier ice is likely to disappear, with projected mass losses of
49 ± 7 per cent, 51 ± 6 per cent and 64 ± 5 per cent, respectively, by the end of
the century; these projections have potentially serious consequences for regional
water management and mountain communities.

As an exoplanet transits its host star, some of the light from the star is
absorbed by the atoms and molecules in the planet's atmosphere, causing the
planet to seem bigger; plotting the planet's observed size as a function of the
wavelength of the light produces a transmission spectrum. Measuring the tiny
variations in the transmission spectrum, together with atmospheric modelling,
then gives clues to the properties of the exoplanet's atmosphere. Chemical
species composed of light elements-such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, sodium and
potassium-have in this way been detected in the atmospheres of several hot giant 
exoplanets, but molecules composed of heavier elements have thus far proved
elusive. Nonetheless, it has been predicted that metal oxides such as titanium
oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide occur in the observable regions of the very
hottest exoplanetary atmospheres, causing thermal inversions on the dayside. Here
we report the detection of TiO in the atmosphere of the hot-Jupiter planet
WASP-19b. Our combined spectrum, with its wide spectral coverage, reveals the
presence of TiO (to a confidence level of 7.7σ), a strongly scattering haze
(7.4σ) and sodium (3.4σ), and confirms the presence of water (7.9σ) in the
atmosphere.

The ability to control chemical and physical structuring at the nanometre scale
is important for developing high-performance thermoelectric materials. Progress
in this area has been achieved mainly by enhancing phonon scattering and
consequently decreasing the thermal conductivity of the lattice through the
design of either interface structures at nanometre or mesoscopic length scales or
multiscale hierarchical architectures. A nanostructuring approach that enables
electron transport as well as phonon transport to be manipulated could
potentially lead to further enhancements in thermoelectric performance. Here we
show that by embedding nanoparticles of a soft magnetic material in a
thermoelectric matrix we achieve dual control of phonon- and electron-transport
properties. The properties of the nanoparticles-in particular, their
superparamagnetic behaviour (in which the nanoparticles can be magnetized
similarly to a paramagnet under an external magnetic field)-lead to three kinds
of thermoelectromagnetic effect: charge transfer from the magnetic inclusions to 
the matrix; multiple scattering of electrons by superparamagnetic fluctuations;
and enhanced phonon scattering as a result of both the magnetic fluctuations and 
the nanostructures themselves. We show that together these effects can
effectively manipulate electron and phonon transport at nanometre and mesoscopic 
length scales and thereby improve the thermoelectric performance of the resulting
nanocomposites.

Cryptography is essential for the security of online communication, cars and
implanted medical devices. However, many commonly used cryptosystems will be
completely broken once large quantum computers exist. Post-quantum cryptography
is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum
computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this
scenario. This relatively young research area has seen some successes in
identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms offer little
advantage in speed, and then building cryptographic systems around those. The
central challenge in post-quantum cryptography is to meet demands for
cryptographic usability and flexibility without sacrificing confidence.

Although ferromagnets have many applications, their large magnetization and the
resulting energy cost for switching magnetic moments bring into question their
suitability for reliable low-power spintronic devices. Non-collinear
antiferromagnetic systems do not suffer from this problem, and often have extra
functionalities: non-collinear spin order may break space-inversion symmetry and 
thus allow electric-field control of magnetism, or may produce emergent
spin-orbit effects that enable efficient spin-charge interconversion. To harness 
these traits for next-generation spintronics, the nanoscale control and imaging
capabilities that are now routine for ferromagnets must be developed for
antiferromagnetic systems. Here, using a non-invasive, scanning single-spin
magnetometer based on a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond, we demonstrate
real-space visualization of non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in a magnetic
thin film at room temperature. We image the spin cycloid of a multiferroic
bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) thin film and extract a period of about 70 nanometres,
consistent with values determined by macroscopic diffraction. In addition, we
take advantage of the magnetoelectric coupling present in BiFeO3 to manipulate
the cycloid propagation direction by an electric field. Besides highlighting the 
potential of nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry for imaging complex antiferromagnetic 
orders at the nanoscale, these results demonstrate how BiFeO3 can be used in the 
design of reconfigurable nanoscale spin textures.

Paediatric solid tumours arise from endodermal, ectodermal, or mesodermal
lineages. Although the overall survival of children with solid tumours is 75%,
that of children with recurrent disease is below 30%. To capture the complexity
and diversity of paediatric solid tumours and establish new models of recurrent
disease, here we develop a protocol to produce orthotopic patient-derived
xenografts at diagnosis, recurrence, and autopsy. Tumour specimens were received 
from 168 patients, and 67 orthotopic patient-derived xenografts were established 
for 12 types of cancer. The origins of the patient-derived xenograft tumours were
reflected in their gene-expression profiles and epigenomes. Genomic profiling of 
the tumours, including detailed clonal analysis, was performed to determine
whether the clonal population in the xenograft recapitulated the patient's
tumour. We identified several drug vulnerabilities and showed that the
combination of a WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775), irinotecan, and vincristine can lead
to complete response in multiple rhabdomyosarcoma orthotopic patient-derived
xenografts tumours in vivo.

The majority of genetic variants associated with common human diseases map to
enhancers, non-coding elements that shape cell-type-specific transcriptional
programs and responses to extracellular cues. Systematic mapping of functional
enhancers and their biological contexts is required to understand the mechanisms 
by which variation in non-coding genetic sequences contributes to disease.
Functional enhancers can be mapped by genomic sequence disruption, but this
approach is limited to the subset of enhancers that are necessary in the
particular cellular context being studied. We hypothesized that recruitment of a 
strong transcriptional activator to an enhancer would be sufficient to drive
target gene expression, even if that enhancer was not currently active in the
assayed cells. Here we describe a discovery platform that can identify
stimulus-responsive enhancers for a target gene independent of stimulus exposure.
We used tiled CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) to synthetically recruit a
transcriptional activator to sites across large genomic regions (more than 100
kilobases) surrounding two key autoimmunity risk loci, CD69 and IL2RA. We
identified several CRISPRa-responsive elements with chromatin features of
stimulus-responsive enhancers, including an IL2RA enhancer that harbours an
autoimmunity risk variant. Using engineered mouse models, we found that sequence 
perturbation of the disease-associated Il2ra enhancer did not entirely block
Il2ra expression, but rather delayed the timing of gene activation in response to
specific extracellular signals. Enhancer deletion skewed polarization of naive T 
cells towards a pro-inflammatory T helper (TH17) cell state and away from a
regulatory T cell state. This integrated approach identifies functional enhancers
and reveals how non-coding variation associated with human immune dysfunction
alters context-specific gene programs.

Commensal bacteria are believed to have important roles in human health. The
mechanisms by which they affect mammalian physiology remain poorly understood,
but bacterial metabolites are likely to be key components of host interactions.
Here we use bioinformatics and synthetic biology to mine the human microbiota for
N-acyl amides that interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found
that N-acyl amide synthase genes are enriched in gastrointestinal bacteria and
the lipids that they encode interact with GPCRs that regulate gastrointestinal
tract physiology. Mouse and cell-based models demonstrate that commensal GPR119
agonists regulate metabolic hormones and glucose homeostasis as efficiently as
human ligands, although future studies are needed to define their potential
physiological role in humans. Our results suggest that chemical mimicry of
eukaryotic signalling molecules may be common among commensal bacteria and that
manipulation of microbiota genes encoding metabolites that elicit host cellular
responses represents a possible small-molecule therapeutic modality
(microbiome-biosynthetic gene therapy).

Studies on the distribution and evolution of organisms on oceanic islands have
advanced towards a dynamic perspective, where terrestrial endemicity results from
island geographical aspects and geological history intertwined with sea-level
fluctuations. Diversification on these islands may follow neutral models,
decreasing over time as niches are filled, or disequilibrium states and
progression rules, where richness and endemism rise with the age of the
archipelago owing to the splitting of ancestral lineages (cladogenesis). However,
marine organisms have received comparatively little scientific attention.
Therefore, island and seamount evolutionary processes in the aquatic environment 
remain unclear. Here we analyse the evolutionary history of reef fishes that are 
endemic to a volcanic ridge of seamounts and islands to understand their
relations to island evolution and sea-level fluctuations. We also test how this
evolutionary history fits island biogeography theory. We found that most endemic 
species have evolved recently (Pleistocene epoch), during a period of recurrent
sea-level changes and intermittent connectivity caused by repeated aerial
exposure of seamounts, a finding that is consistent with an ephemeral ecological 
speciation process. Similar to findings for terrestrial biodiversity, our data
suggest that the marine speciation rate on islands is negatively correlated with 
immigration rate. However, because marine species disperse better than
terrestrial species, most niches are filled by immigration: speciation increases 
with the random accumulation of species with low dispersal ability, with few
opportunities for in situ cladogenesis and adaptive radiation. Moreover, we
confirm that sea-level fluctuations and seamount location play a critical role in
marine evolution, mainly by intermittently providing stepping stones for island
colonization.

Singly or doubly bonded polynitrogen compounds can decompose to dinitrogen (N2)
with an extremely large energy release. This makes them attractive as potential
explosives or propellants, but also challenging to produce in a stable form.
Polynitrogen materials containing nitrogen as the only element exist in the form 
of high-pressure polymeric phases, but under ambient conditions even
metastability is realized only in the presence of other elements that provide
stabilization. An early example is the molecule phenylpentazole, with a
five-membered all-nitrogen ring, which was first reported in the 1900s and
characterized in the 1950s. Salts containing the azide anion (N3-) or pentazenium
cation (N5+) are also known, with compounds containing the pentazole anion,
cyclo-N5-, a more recent addition. Very recently, a bulk material containing this
species was reported and then used to prepare the first example of a solid-state 
metal-N5 complex. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of five metal
pentazolate hydrate complexes [Na(H2O)(N5)]·2H2O, [M(H2O)4(N5)2]·4H2O (M = Mn, Fe
and Co) and [Mg(H2O)6(N5)2]·4H2O that, with the exception of the Co complex,
exhibit good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures greater than
100 °C. For this series we find that the N5- ion can coordinate to the metal
cation through either ionic or covalent interactions, and is stabilized through
hydrogen-bonding interactions with water. Given their energetic properties and
stability, pentazole-metal complexes might potentially serve as a new class of
high-energy density materials or enable the development of such materials
containing only nitrogen. We also anticipate that the adaptability of the N5- ion
in terms of its bonding interactions will enable the exploration of inorganic
nitrogen analogues of metallocenes and other unusual polynitrogen complexes.

Nuclear small RNA pathways safeguard genome integrity by establishing
transcription-repressing heterochromatin at transposable elements. This
inevitably also targets the transposon-rich source loci of the small RNAs
themselves. How small RNA source loci are efficiently transcribed while
transposon promoters are potently silenced is not understood. Here we show that, 
in Drosophila, transcription of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) clusters-small RNA
source loci in animal gonads-is enforced through RNA polymerase II pre-initiation
complex formation within repressive heterochromatin. This is accomplished through
Moonshiner, a paralogue of a basal transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) subunit,
which is recruited to piRNA clusters via the heterochromatin protein-1 variant
Rhino. Moonshiner triggers transcription initiation within piRNA clusters by
recruiting the TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-related factor TRF2, an animal
TFIID core variant. Thus, transcription of heterochromatic small RNA source loci 
relies on direct recruitment of the core transcriptional machinery to DNA via
histone marks rather than sequence motifs, a concept that we argue is a recurring
theme in evolution.

An arbitrary unknown quantum state cannot be measured precisely or replicated
perfectly. However, quantum teleportation enables unknown quantum states to be
transferred reliably from one object to another over long distances, without
physical travelling of the object itself. Long-distance teleportation is a
fundamental element of protocols such as large-scale quantum networks and
distributed quantum computation. But the distances over which transmission was
achieved in previous teleportation experiments, which used optical fibres and
terrestrial free-space channels, were limited to about 100 kilometres, owing to
the photon loss of these channels. To realize a global-scale 'quantum internet'
the range of quantum teleportation needs to be greatly extended. A promising way 
of doing so involves using satellite platforms and space-based links, which can
connect two remote points on Earth with greatly reduced channel loss because most
of the propagation path of the photons is in empty space. Here we report quantum 
teleportation of independent single-photon qubits from a ground observatory to a 
low-Earth-orbit satellite, through an uplink channel, over distances of up to
1,400 kilometres. To optimize the efficiency of the link and to counter the
atmospheric turbulence in the uplink, we use a compact ultra-bright source of
entangled photons, a narrow beam divergence and high-bandwidth and high-accuracy 
acquiring, pointing and tracking. We demonstrate successful quantum teleportation
of six input states in mutually unbiased bases with an average fidelity of
0.80 ± 0.01, well above the optimal state-estimation fidelity on a single copy of
a qubit (the classical limit). Our demonstration of a ground-to-satellite uplink 
for reliable and ultra-long-distance quantum teleportation is an essential step
towards a global-scale quantum internet.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) uses individual light quanta in quantum
superposition states to guarantee unconditional communication security between
distant parties. However, the distance over which QKD is achievable has been
limited to a few hundred kilometres, owing to the channel loss that occurs when
using optical fibres or terrestrial free space that exponentially reduces the
photon transmission rate. Satellite-based QKD has the potential to help to
establish a global-scale quantum network, owing to the negligible photon loss and
decoherence experienced in empty space. Here we report the development and launch
of a low-Earth-orbit satellite for implementing decoy-state QKD-a form of QKD
that uses weak coherent pulses at high channel loss and is secure because
photon-number-splitting eavesdropping can be detected. We achieve a kilohertz key
rate from the satellite to the ground over a distance of up to 1,200 kilometres. 
This key rate is around 20 orders of magnitudes greater than that expected using 
an optical fibre of the same length. The establishment of a reliable and
efficient space-to-ground link for quantum-state transmission paves the way to

Cancer cells exploit the expression of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand 1
(PD-L1) to subvert T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. The success of therapies
that disrupt PD-L1-mediated tumour tolerance has highlighted the need to
understand the molecular regulation of PD-L1 expression. Here we identify the
uncharacterized protein CMTM6 as a critical regulator of PD-L1 in a broad range
of cancer cells, by using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. CMTM6 is a
ubiquitously expressed protein that binds PD-L1 and maintains its cell surface
expression. CMTM6 is not required for PD-L1 maturation but co-localizes with
PD-L1 at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes, where it prevents PD-L1 
from being targeted for lysosome-mediated degradation. Using a quantitative
approach to profile the entire plasma membrane proteome, we find that CMTM6
displays specificity for PD-L1. Notably, CMTM6 depletion decreases PD-L1 without 
compromising cell surface expression of MHC class I. CMTM6 depletion, via the
reduction of PD-L1, significantly alleviates the suppression of tumour-specific T
cell activity in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide insights into the
biology of PD-L1 regulation, identify a previously unrecognized master regulator 
of this critical immune checkpoint and highlight a potential therapeutic target
to overcome immune evasion by tumour cells.

The clinical benefit for patients with diverse types of metastatic cancers that
has been observed upon blockade of the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 has
highlighted the importance of this inhibitory axis in the suppression of
tumour-specific T-cell responses. Notwithstanding the key role of PD-L1
expression by cells within the tumour micro-environment, our understanding of the
regulation of the PD-L1 protein is limited. Here we identify, using a haploid
genetic screen, CMTM6, a type-3 transmembrane protein of previously unknown
function, as a regulator of the PD-L1 protein. Interference with CMTM6 expression
results in impaired PD-L1 protein expression in all human tumour cell types
tested and in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, through both a haploid 
genetic modifier screen in CMTM6-deficient cells and genetic complementation
experiments, we demonstrate that this function is shared by its closest family
member, CMTM4, but not by any of the other CMTM members tested. Notably, CMTM6
increases the PD-L1 protein pool without affecting PD-L1 (also known as CD274)
transcription levels. Rather, we demonstrate that CMTM6 is present at the cell
surface, associates with the PD-L1 protein, reduces its ubiquitination and
increases PD-L1 protein half-life. Consistent with its role in PD-L1 protein
regulation, CMTM6 enhances the ability of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells to
inhibit T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that PD-L1 relies on CMTM6/4 to
efficiently carry out its inhibitory function, and suggest potential new avenues 
to block this pathway.

Glutamate receptors are well characterized channels that mediate cell-to-cell
communication during neurotransmission in animals, but their functional role in
organisms without a nervous system remains unclear. In plants, genes of the
GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE (GLR) family have been implicated in defence against
pathogens, reproduction, control of stomata aperture and light signal
transduction. However, the large number of GLR genes present in angiosperm
genomes (20 to 70) has prevented the observation of strong phenotypes in
loss-of-function mutants. Here we show that in the basal land plant
Physcomitrella patens, mutation of the GLR genes GLR1 and GLR2 causes failure of 
sperm cells to target the female reproductive organs. In addition, we show that
GLR genes encode non-selective Ca2+-permeable channels that can regulate
cytoplasmic Ca2+ and are needed to induce the expression of a BELL1-like
transcription factor essential for zygote development. Our work reveals functions
for GLR channels in sperm chemotaxis and transcriptional regulation. Sperm
chemotaxis is essential for fertilization in both animals and early land plants
such as bryophytes and pteridophytes. Therefore, our results suggest that
ionotropic glutamate receptors may have been conserved throughout plant evolution
to mediate cell-to-cell communication during sexual reproduction.

AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-subtype ionotropic
glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission throughout the
central nervous system. Gated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, AMPA receptors
are critical for synaptic strength, and dysregulation of AMPA receptor-mediated
signalling is linked to numerous neurological diseases. Here we use cryo-electron
microscopy to solve the structures of AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes
in the apo, antagonist- and agonist-bound states and determine the iris-like
mechanism of ion channel opening. The ion channel selectivity filter is formed by
the extended portions of the re-entrant M2 loops, while the helical portions of
M2 contribute to extensive hydrophobic interfaces between AMPA receptor subunits 
in the ion channel. We show how the permeation pathway changes upon channel
opening and identify conformational changes throughout the entire AMPA receptor
that accompany activation and desensitization. Our findings provide a framework
for understanding gating across the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors and 
the role of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurotransmission.

The most intense auroral emissions from Earth's polar regions, called discrete
for their sharply defined spatial configurations, are generated by a process
involving coherent acceleration of electrons by slowly evolving, powerful
electric fields directed along the magnetic field lines that connect Earth's
space environment to its polar regions. In contrast, Earth's less intense auroras
are generally caused by wave scattering of magnetically trapped populations of
hot electrons (in the case of diffuse aurora) or by the turbulent or stochastic
downward acceleration of electrons along magnetic field lines by waves during
transitory periods (in the case of broadband or Alfvénic aurora). Jupiter's
relatively steady main aurora has a power density that is so much larger than
Earth's that it has been taken for granted that it must be generated primarily by
the discrete auroral process. However, preliminary in situ measurements of
Jupiter's auroral regions yielded no evidence of such a process. Here we report
observations of distinct, high-energy, downward, discrete electron acceleration
in Jupiter's auroral polar regions. We also infer upward magnetic-field-aligned
electric potentials of up to 400 kiloelectronvolts, an order of magnitude larger 
than the largest potentials observed at Earth. Despite the magnitude of these
upward electric potentials and the expectations from observations at Earth, the
downward energy flux from discrete acceleration is less at Jupiter than that
caused by broadband or stochastic processes, with broadband and stochastic
characteristics that are substantially different from those at Earth.

The activity of heterogeneous catalysts-which are involved in some 80 per cent of
processes in the chemical and energy industries-is determined by the electronic
structure of specific surface sites that offer optimal binding of reaction
intermediates. Directly identifying and monitoring these sites during a reaction 
should therefore provide insight that might aid the targeted development of
heterogeneous catalysts and electrocatalysts (those that participate in
electrochemical reactions) for practical applications. The invention of the
scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) and the electrochemical STM promised to
deliver such imaging capabilities, and both have indeed contributed greatly to
our atomistic understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. But although the STM has 
been used to probe and initiate surface reactions, and has even enabled local
measurements of reactivity in some systems, it is not generally thought to be
suited to the direct identification of catalytically active surface sites under
reaction conditions. Here we demonstrate, however, that common STMs can readily
map the catalytic activity of surfaces with high spatial resolution: we show that
by monitoring relative changes in the tunnelling current noise, active sites can 
be distinguished in an almost quantitative fashion according to their ability to 
catalyse the hydrogen-evolution reaction or the oxygen-reduction reaction. These 
data allow us to evaluate directly the importance and relative contribution to
overall catalyst activity of different defects and sites at the boundaries
between two materials. With its ability to deliver such information and its ready
applicability to different systems, we anticipate that our method will aid the
rational design of heterogeneous catalysts.

Most animals show external bilateral symmetry, which hinders the observation of
multiple internal left-right (L/R) asymmetries that are fundamental to organ
packaging and function. In vertebrates, left identity is mediated by the
left-specific Nodal-Pitx2 axis that is repressed on the right-hand side by the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducer Snail1 (refs 3, 4). Despite some 
existing evidence, it remains unclear whether an equivalent instructive pathway
provides right-hand-specific information to the embryo. Here we show that, in
zebrafish, BMP mediates the L/R asymmetric activation of another EMT inducer,
Prrx1a, in the lateral plate mesoderm with higher levels on the right. Prrx1a
drives L/R differential cell movements towards the midline, leading to a leftward
displacement of the cardiac posterior pole through an actomyosin-dependent
mechanism. Downregulation of Prrx1a prevents heart looping and leads to
mesocardia. Two parallel and mutually repressed pathways, respectively driven by 
Nodal and BMP on the left and right lateral plate mesoderm, converge on the
asymmetric activation of the transcription factors Pitx2 and Prrx1, which
integrate left and right information to govern heart morphogenesis. This
mechanism is conserved in the chicken embryo, and in the mouse SNAIL1 acts in a
similar manner to Prrx1a in zebrafish and PRRX1 in the chick. Thus, a
differential L/R EMT produces asymmetric cell movements and forces, more
prominent from the right, that drive heart laterality in vertebrates.

Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have a pivotal role in the establishment and
maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. Transcriptional
programming of regulatory mechanisms facilitates the functional activation of
Treg cells in the prevention of diverse types of inflammatory responses. It
remains unclear how Treg cells orchestrate their homeostasis and interplay with
environmental signals. Here we show that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) programs the
metabolic and functional fitness of Treg cells in the control of immune tolerance
and homeostasis. Mice with a Treg-specific deletion of LKB1 developed a fatal
inflammatory disease characterized by excessive TH2-type-dominant responses. LKB1
deficiency disrupted Treg cell survival and mitochondrial fitness and metabolism,
but also induced aberrant expression of immune regulatory molecules including the
negative co-receptor PD-1 and the TNF receptor superfamily proteins GITR and
OX40. Unexpectedly, LKB1 function in Treg cells was independent of conventional
AMPK signalling or the mTORC1-HIF-1α axis, but contributed to the activation of
β-catenin signalling for the control of PD-1 and TNF receptor proteins. Blockade 
of PD-1 activity reinvigorated the ability of LKB1-deficient Treg cells to
suppress TH2 responses and the interplay with dendritic cells primed by thymic
stromal lymphopoietin. Thus, Treg cells use LKB1 signalling to coordinate their
metabolic and immunological homeostasis and to prevent apoptotic and functional
exhaustion, thereby orchestrating the balance between immunity and tolerance.

In two previously described donors, the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a
collagen-binding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19 (ref. 1), was
inserted between the V and DJ segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, 
through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of 
variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected
erythrocytes. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in
response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of
individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. Here we report that 5-10% of
malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have
high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to infected
erythrocytes without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By
analysing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA
levels, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ
segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon
encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted
into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production
of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the
elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the genomic DNA 
encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a
camel-like LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory 
B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts
originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with
orientations and frames compatible with expression. These results reveal
different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant
antibodies against infected erythrocytes and suggest that insertion of templated 
DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be
selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell
engineering.

Multiple populations of wake-promoting neurons have been characterized in
mammals, but few sleep-promoting neurons have been identified. Wake-promoting
cell types include hypocretin and GABA (γ-aminobutyric-acid)-releasing neurons of
the lateral hypothalamus, which promote the transition to wakefulness from
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here we show
that a subset of GABAergic neurons in the mouse ventral zona incerta, which
express the LIM homeodomain factor Lhx6 and are activated by sleep pressure, both
directly inhibit wake-active hypocretin and GABAergic cells in the lateral
hypothalamus and receive inputs from multiple sleep-wake-regulating neurons.
Conditional deletion of Lhx6 from the developing diencephalon leads to decreases 
in both NREM and REM sleep. Furthermore, selective activation and inhibition of
Lhx6-positive neurons in the ventral zona incerta bidirectionally regulate sleep 
time in adult mice, in part through hypocretin-dependent mechanisms. These
studies identify a GABAergic subpopulation of neurons in the ventral zona incerta
that promote sleep.

Epithelial organs undergo steady-state turnover throughout adult life, with old
cells being continually replaced by the progeny of stem cell divisions. To avoid 
hyperplasia or atrophy, organ turnover demands strict equilibration of cell
production and loss. However, the mechanistic basis of this equilibrium is
unknown. Here we show that robustly precise turnover of the adult Drosophila
intestine arises through a coupling mechanism in which enterocyte apoptosis
breaks feedback inhibition of stem cell division. Healthy enterocytes inhibit
stem cell division through E-cadherin, which prevents secretion of mitogenic
epidermal growth factors (EGFs) by repressing transcription of the EGF maturation
factor rhomboid. Individual apoptotic enterocytes promote divisions by loss of
E-cadherin, which releases cadherin-associated β-catenin (Armadillo in
Drosophila) and p120-catenin to induce rhomboid. Induction of rhomboid in the
dying enterocyte triggers activation of the EGF receptor (Egfr) in stem cells
within a discrete radius. When we blocked apoptosis, E-cadherin-controlled
feedback suppressed divisions, and the organ retained the same number of cells.
When we disrupted feedback, apoptosis and divisions were uncoupled, and the organ
developed either hyperplasia or atrophy. Together, our results show that robust
cellular balance hinges on the obligate coupling of divisions to apoptosis, which
limits the proliferative potential of a stem cell to the precise time and place
at which a replacement cell is needed. In this way, localized cell-cell
communication gives rise to tissue-level homeostatic equilibrium and constant
organ size.

Magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable, vortex-like objects surrounded by
chiral boundaries that separate a region of reversed magnetization from the
surrounding magnetized material. They are closely related to nanoscopic chiral
magnetic domain walls, which could be used as memory and logic elements for
conventional and neuromorphic computing applications that go beyond Moore's law. 
Of particular interest is 'racetrack memory', which is composed of vertical
magnetic nanowires, each accommodating of the order of 100 domain walls, and that
shows promise as a solid state, non-volatile memory with exceptional capacity and
performance. Its performance is derived from the very high speeds (up to one
kilometre per second) at which chiral domain walls can be moved with nanosecond
current pulses in synthetic antiferromagnet racetracks. Because skyrmions are
essentially composed of a pair of chiral domain walls closed in on themselves,
but are, in principle, more stable to perturbations than the component domain
walls themselves, they are attractive for use in spintronic applications, notably
racetrack memory. Stabilization of skyrmions has generally been achieved in
systems with broken inversion symmetry, in which the asymmetric
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction modifies the uniform magnetic state to a
swirling state. Depending on the crystal symmetry, two distinct types of
skyrmions have been observed experimentally, namely, Bloch and Néel skyrmions.
Here we present the experimental manifestation of another type of skyrmion-the
magnetic antiskyrmion-in acentric tetragonal Heusler compounds with D2d crystal
symmetry. Antiskyrmions are characterized by boundary walls that have alternating
Bloch and Néel type as one traces around the boundary. A spiral magnetic
ground-state, which propagates in the tetragonal basal plane, is transformed into
an antiskyrmion lattice state under magnetic fields applied along the tetragonal 
axis over a wide range of temperatures. Direct imaging by Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy shows field-stabilized antiskyrmion lattices and isolated
antiskyrmions from 100 kelvin to well beyond room temperature, and zero-field
metastable antiskyrmions at low temperatures. These results enlarge the family of
magnetic skyrmions and pave the way to the engineering of complex bespoke
designed skyrmionic structures.

The folate-driven one-carbon (1C) cycle is a fundamental metabolic hub in cells
that enables the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids and epigenetic
modifications. This cycle might also release formaldehyde, a potent protein and
DNA crosslinking agent that organisms produce in substantial quantities. Here we 
show that supplementation with tetrahydrofolate, the essential cofactor of this
cycle, and other oxidation-prone folate derivatives kills human, mouse and
chicken cells that cannot detoxify formaldehyde or that lack DNA crosslink
repair. Notably, formaldehyde is generated from oxidative decomposition of the
folate backbone. Furthermore, we find that formaldehyde detoxification in human
cells generates formate, and thereby promotes nucleotide synthesis. This supply
of 1C units is sufficient to sustain the growth of cells that are unable to use
serine, which is the predominant source of 1C units. These findings identify an
unexpected source of formaldehyde and, more generally, indicate that the
detoxification of this ubiquitous endogenous genotoxin creates a benign 1C unit
that can sustain essential metabolism.

The transition from dominant bacterial to eukaryotic marine primary productivity 
was one of the most profound ecological revolutions in the Earth's history,
reorganizing the distribution of carbon and nutrients in the water column and
increasing energy flow to higher trophic levels. But the causes and geological
timing of this transition, as well as possible links with rising atmospheric
oxygen levels and the evolution of animals, remain obscure. Here we present a
molecular fossil record of eukaryotic steroids demonstrating that bacteria were
the only notable primary producers in the oceans before the Cryogenian period
(720-635 million years ago). Increasing steroid diversity and abundance marks the
rapid rise of marine planktonic algae (Archaeplastida) in the narrow time
interval between the Sturtian and Marinoan 'snowball Earth' glaciations,
659-645 million years ago. We propose that the incumbency of cyanobacteria was
broken by a surge of nutrients supplied by the Sturtian deglaciation. The 'Rise
of Algae' created food webs with more efficient nutrient and energy transfers,
driving ecosystems towards larger and increasingly complex organisms. This effect
is recorded by the concomitant appearance of biomarkers for sponges and predatory
rhizarians, and the subsequent radiation of eumetazoans in the Ediacaran period.

Somatic gene mutations can alter the vulnerability of cancer cells to
T-cell-based immunotherapies. Here we perturbed genes in human melanoma cells to 
mimic loss-of-function mutations involved in resistance to these therapies, by
using a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 library that consisted of around 123,000
single-guide RNAs, and profiled genes whose loss in tumour cells impaired the
effector function of CD8+ T cells. The genes that were most enriched in the
screen have key roles in antigen presentation and interferon-γ signalling, and
correlate with cytolytic activity in patient tumours from The Cancer Genome
Atlas. Among the genes validated using different cancer cell lines and antigens, 
we identified multiple loss-of-function mutations in APLNR, encoding the apelin
receptor, in patient tumours that were refractory to immunotherapy. We show that 
APLNR interacts with JAK1, modulating interferon-γ responses in tumours, and that
its functional loss reduces the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer and checkpoint
blockade immunotherapies in mouse models. Our results link the loss of essential 
genes for the effector function of CD8+ T cells with the resistance or
non-responsiveness of cancer to immunotherapies.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers regulate access to genetic information by
controlling nucleosome positions in vivo. However, the mechanism by which
remodellers discriminate between different nucleosome substrates is poorly
understood. Many chromatin remodelling proteins possess conserved protein domains
that interact with nucleosomal features. Here we used a quantitative
high-throughput approach, based on the use of a DNA-barcoded mononucleosome
library, to profile the biochemical activity of human ISWI family remodellers in 
response to a diverse set of nucleosome modifications. We show that accessory
(non-ATPase) subunits of ISWI remodellers can distinguish between differentially 
modified nucleosomes, directing remodelling activity towards specific nucleosome 
substrates according to their modification state. Unexpectedly, we show that the 
nucleosome acidic patch is necessary for maximum activity of all ISWI remodellers
evaluated. This dependence also extends to CHD and SWI/SNF family remodellers,
suggesting that the acidic patch may be generally required for chromatin
remodelling. Critically, remodelling activity can be regulated by modifications
neighbouring the acidic patch, signifying that it may act as a tunable
interaction hotspot for ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers and, by extension,
many other chromatin effectors that engage this region of the nucleosome surface.

In many prokaryotes, type III clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems detect and degrade invasive
genetic elements by an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting multisubunit interference
complex. The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6 additionally contributes to
interference by functioning as a standalone RNase that degrades invader RNA
transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6 activity is not
understood. Here we show that Csm6 proteins are activated through a second
messenger generated by the type III interference complex. Upon target RNA binding
by the interference complex, its Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic
oligoadenylate product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its
CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold (CARF) domain. CARF domain mutations that abolish
allosteric activation inhibit Csm6 activity in vivo, and mutations in the Cas10
Palm domain phenocopy loss of Csm6. Together, these results point to an
unprecedented mechanism for regulation of CRISPR interference that bears striking
conceptual similarity to oligoadenylate signalling in mammalian innate immunity.

Quantifying image distortions caused by strong gravitational lensing-the
formation of multiple images of distant sources due to the deflection of their
light by the gravity of intervening structures-and estimating the corresponding
matter distribution of these structures (the 'gravitational lens') has primarily 
been performed using maximum likelihood modelling of observations. This procedure
is typically time- and resource-consuming, requiring sophisticated lensing codes,
several data preparation steps, and finding the maximum likelihood model
parameters in a computationally expensive process with downhill optimizers.
Accurate analysis of a single gravitational lens can take up to a few weeks and
requires expert knowledge of the physical processes and methods involved. Tens of
thousands of new lenses are expected to be discovered with the upcoming
generation of ground and space surveys. Here we report the use of deep
convolutional neural networks to estimate lensing parameters in an extremely fast
and automated way, circumventing the difficulties that are faced by maximum
likelihood methods. We also show that the removal of lens light can be made fast 
and automated using independent component analysis of multi-filter imaging data. 
Our networks can recover the parameters of the 'singular isothermal ellipsoid'
density profile, which is commonly used to model strong lensing systems, with an 
accuracy comparable to the uncertainties of sophisticated models but about ten
million times faster: 100 systems in approximately one second on a single
graphics processing unit. These networks can provide a way for non-experts to
obtain estimates of lensing parameters for large samples of data.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are a promising source for a
cell-based therapy to treat Parkinson's disease (PD), in which midbrain
dopaminergic neurons progressively degenerate. However, long-term analysis of
human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate PD models has never been
performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic
progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a
primate model of PD (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin MPTP.
Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous
movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that
the mature dopaminergic neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum;
this effect was consistent regardless of whether the cells were derived from
patients with PD or from healthy individuals. Cells sorted by the floor plate
marker CORIN did not form any tumours in the brains for at least two years.
Finally, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were used to
monitor the survival, expansion and function of the grafted cells as well as the 
immune response in the host brain. Thus, this preclinical study using a primate
model indicates that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors are
clinically applicable for the treatment of patients with PD.

The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a global warming event that
occurred about 56 million years ago, and is commonly thought to have been driven 
primarily by the destabilization of carbon from surface sedimentary reservoirs
such as methane hydrates. However, it remains controversial whether such
reservoirs were indeed the source of the carbon that drove the warming. Resolving
this issue is key to understanding the proximal cause of the warming, and to
quantifying the roles of triggers versus feedbacks. Here we present boron isotope
data-a proxy for seawater pH-that show that the ocean surface pH was persistently
low during the PETM. We combine our pH data with a paired carbon isotope record
in an Earth system model in order to reconstruct the unfolding carbon-cycle
dynamics during the event. We find strong evidence for a much larger (more than
10,000 petagrams)-and, on average, isotopically heavier-carbon source than
considered previously. This leads us to identify volcanism associated with the
North Atlantic Igneous Province, rather than carbon from a surface reservoir, as 
the main driver of the PETM. This finding implies that climate-driven
amplification of organic carbon feedbacks probably played only a minor part in
driving the event. However, we find that enhanced burial of organic matter seems 
to have been important in eventually sequestering the released carbon and
accelerating the recovery of the Earth system.

Beyond the more common chemical delivery strategies, several physical techniques 
are used to open the lipid bilayers of cellular membranes. These include using
electric and magnetic fields, temperature, ultrasound or light to introduce
compounds into cells, to release molecular species from cells or to selectively
induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) or uncontrolled cell death (necrosis).
More recently, molecular motors and switches that can change their conformation
in a controlled manner in response to external stimuli have been used to produce 
mechanical actions on tissue for biomedical applications. Here we show that
molecular machines can drill through cellular bilayers using their
molecular-scale actuation, specifically nanomechanical action. Upon physical
adsorption of the molecular motors onto lipid bilayers and subsequent activation 
of the motors using ultraviolet light, holes are drilled in the cell membranes.
We designed molecular motors and complementary experimental protocols that use
nanomechanical action to induce the diffusion of chemical species out of
synthetic vesicles, to enhance the diffusion of traceable molecular machines into
and within live cells, to induce necrosis and to introduce chemical species into 
live cells. We also show that, by using molecular machines that bear short
peptide addends, nanomechanical action can selectively target specific
cell-surface recognition sites. Beyond the in vitro applications demonstrated
here, we expect that molecular machines could also be used in vivo, especially as
their design progresses to allow two-photon, near-infrared and radio-frequency
activation.

'Cataclysmic variables' are binary star systems in which one star of the pair is 
a white dwarf, and which often generate bright and energetic stellar outbursts.
Classical novae are one type of outburst: when the white dwarf accretes enough
matter from its companion, the resulting hydrogen-rich atmospheric envelope can
host a runaway thermonuclear reaction that generates a rapid brightening.
Achieving peak luminosities of up to one million times that of the Sun, all
classical novae are recurrent, on timescales of months to millennia. During the
century before and after an eruption, the 'novalike' binary systems that give
rise to classical novae exhibit high rates of mass transfer to their white
dwarfs. Another type of outburst is the dwarf nova: these occur in binaries that 
have stellar masses and periods indistinguishable from those of novalikes but
much lower mass-transfer rates, when accretion-disk instabilities drop matter
onto the white dwarfs. The co-existence at the same orbital period of novalike
binaries and dwarf novae-which are identical but for their widely varying
accretion rates-has been a longstanding puzzle. Here we report the recovery of
the binary star underlying the classical nova eruption of 11 March AD 1437 (refs 
12, 13), and independently confirm its age by proper-motion dating. We show that,
almost 500 years after a classical-nova event, the system exhibited dwarf-nova
eruptions. The three other oldest recovered classical novae display nova shells, 
but lack firm post-eruption ages, and are also dwarf novae at present. We
conclude that many old novae become dwarf novae for part of the millennia between
successive nova eruptions.

The constant regeneration of stomach epithelium is driven by long-lived stem
cells, but the mechanism that regulates their turnover is not well understood. We
have recently found that the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori can activate
gastric stem cells and increase epithelial turnover, while Wnt signalling is
known to be important for stem cell identity and epithelial regeneration in
several tissues. Here we find that antral Wnt signalling, marked by the classic
Wnt target gene Axin2, is limited to the base and lower isthmus of gastric
glands, where the stem cells reside. Axin2 is expressed by Lgr5+ cells, as well
as adjacent, highly proliferative Lgr5- cells that are able to repopulate entire 
glands, including the base, upon depletion of the Lgr5+ population. Expression of
both Axin2 and Lgr5 requires stroma-derived R-spondin 3 produced by gastric
myofibroblasts proximal to the stem cell compartment. Exogenous R-spondin
administration expands and accelerates proliferation of Axin2+/Lgr5- but not
Lgr5+ cells. Consistent with these observations, H. pylori infection increases
stromal R-spondin 3 expression and expands the Axin2+ cell pool to cause
hyperproliferation and gland hyperplasia. The ability of stromal niche cells to
control and adapt epithelial stem cell dynamics constitutes a sophisticated
mechanism that orchestrates epithelial regeneration and maintenance of tissue
integrity.

Fenethylline, also known by the trade name Captagon, is a synthetic psychoactive 
stimulant that has recently been linked to a substance-use disorder and
'pharmacoterrorism' in the Middle East. Although fenethylline shares a common
phenethylamine core with other amphetamine-type stimulants, it also incorporates 
a covalently linked xanthine moiety into its parent structure. These
independently active pharmacophores are liberated during metabolism, resulting in
the release of a structurally diverse chemical mixture into the central nervous
system. Although the psychoactive properties of fenethylline have been reported
to differ from those of other synthetic stimulants, the in vivo chemical
complexity it manifests upon ingestion has impeded efforts to unambiguously
identify the specific species responsible for these effects. Here we develop a
'dissection through vaccination' approach, called DISSECTIV, to mitigate the
psychoactive effects of fenethylline and show that its rapid-onset and distinct
psychoactive properties are facilitated by functional synergy between
theophylline and amphetamine. Our results demonstrate that incremental
vaccination against a single chemical species within a multi-component mixture
can be used to uncover emergent properties arising from polypharmacological
activity. We anticipate that DISSECTIV will be used to expose unidentified active
chemical species and resolve pharmacodynamic interactions within other chemically
complex systems, such as those found in counterfeit or illegal drug preparations,
post-metabolic tissue samples and natural product extracts.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) pose challenges for drug discovery efforts
because of the high degree of structural homology in the orthosteric pocket,
particularly for GPCRs within a single subfamily, such as the nine adrenergic
receptors. Allosteric ligands may bind to less-conserved regions of these
receptors and therefore are more likely to be selective. Unlike orthosteric
ligands, which tonically activate or inhibit signalling, allosteric ligands
modulate physiologic responses to hormones and neurotransmitters, and may
therefore have fewer adverse effects. The majority of GPCR crystal structures
published to date were obtained with receptors bound to orthosteric antagonists, 
and only a few structures bound to allosteric ligands have been reported.
Compound 15 (Cmpd-15) is an allosteric modulator of the β2 adrenergic receptor
(β2AR) that was recently isolated from a DNA-encoded small-molecule library.
Orthosteric β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, known as beta-blockers, are
amongst the most prescribed drugs in the world and Cmpd-15 is the first
allosteric beta-blocker. Cmpd-15 exhibits negative cooperativity with agonists
and positive cooperativity with inverse agonists. Here we present the structure
of the β2AR bound to a polyethylene glycol-carboxylic acid derivative (Cmpd-15PA)
of this modulator. Cmpd-15PA binds to a pocket formed primarily by the
cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments 1, 2, 6 and 7 as well as intracellular
loop 1 and helix 8. A comparison of this structure with inactive- and
active-state structures of the β2AR reveals the mechanism by which Cmpd-15
modulates agonist binding affinity and signalling.

Starburst galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation are among the most
extreme star-forming engines in the Universe, producing stars over about 100
million years (ref. 2). The star-formation rates of these galaxies, which exceed 
100 solar masses per year, require large reservoirs of cold molecular gas to be
delivered to their cores, despite strong feedback from stars or active galactic
nuclei. Consequently, starburst galaxies are ideal for studying the interplay
between this feedback and the growth of a galaxy. The methylidyne cation, CH+, is
a most useful molecule for such studies because it cannot form in cold gas
without suprathermal energy input, so its presence indicates dissipation of
mechanical energy or strong ultraviolet irradiation. Here we report the detection
of CH+ (J = 1-0) emission and absorption lines in the spectra of six lensed
starburst galaxies at redshifts near 2.5. This line has such a high critical
density for excitation that it is emitted only in very dense gas, and is absorbed
in low-density gas. We find that the CH+ emission lines, which are broader than
1,000 kilometres per second, originate in dense shock waves powered by hot
galactic winds. The CH+ absorption lines reveal highly turbulent reservoirs of
cool (about 100 kelvin), low-density gas, extending far (more than 10
kiloparsecs) outside the starburst galaxies (which have radii of less than 1
kiloparsec). We show that the galactic winds sustain turbulence in the
10-kiloparsec-scale environments of the galaxies, processing these environments
into multiphase, gravitationally bound reservoirs. However, the mass outflow
rates are found to be insufficient to balance the star-formation rates. Another
mass input is therefore required for these reservoirs, which could be provided by
ongoing mergers or cold-stream accretion. Our results suggest that galactic
feedback, coupled jointly to turbulence and gravity, extends the starburst phase 
of a galaxy instead of quenching it.

Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) are fundamental drivers of the cell
cycle and are required for the initiation and progression of various
malignancies. Pharmacological inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown significant
activity against several solid tumours. Their primary mechanism of action is
thought to be the inhibition of phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumour
suppressor, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Here we use mouse
models of breast carcinoma and other solid tumours to show that selective CDK4/6 
inhibitors not only induce tumour cell cycle arrest, but also promote anti-tumour
immunity. We confirm this phenomenon through transcriptomic analysis of serial
biopsies from a clinical trial of CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment for breast cancer.
The enhanced anti-tumour immune response has two underpinnings. First, CDK4/6
inhibitors activate tumour cell expression of endogenous retroviral elements,
thus increasing intracellular levels of double-stranded RNA. This in turn
stimulates production of type III interferons and hence enhances tumour antigen
presentation. Second, CDK4/6 inhibitors markedly suppress the proliferation of
regulatory T cells. Mechanistically, the effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors both on
tumour cells and on regulatory T cells are associated with reduced activity of
the E2F target, DNA methyltransferase 1. Ultimately, these events promote
cytotoxic T-cell-mediated clearance of tumour cells, which is further enhanced by
the addition of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings indicate that CDK4/6
inhibitors increase tumour immunogenicity and provide a rationale for new
combination regimens comprising CDK4/6 inhibitors and immunotherapies as
anti-cancer treatment.

Sepsis in early infancy results in one million annual deaths worldwide, most of
them in developing countries. No efficient means of prevention is currently
available. Here we report on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
of an oral synbiotic preparation (Lactobacillus plantarum plus
fructooligosaccharide) in rural Indian newborns. We enrolled 4,556 infants that
were at least 2,000 g at birth, at least 35 weeks of gestation, and with no signs
of sepsis or other morbidity, and monitored them for 60 days. We show a
significant reduction in the primary outcome (combination of sepsis and death) in
the treatment arm (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.74), with few 
deaths (4 placebo, 6 synbiotic). Significant reductions were also observed for
culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis and lower respiratory tract
infections. These findings suggest that a large proportion of neonatal sepsis in 
developing countries could be effectively prevented using a synbiotic containing 
L. plantarum ATCC-202195.

Developmental deconvolution of complex organs and tissues at the level of
individual cells remains challenging. Non-invasive genetic fate mapping has been 
widely used, but the low number of distinct fluorescent marker proteins limits
its resolution. Much higher numbers of cell markers have been generated using
viral integration sites, viral barcodes, and strategies based on transposons and 
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing; however, temporal and tissue-specific induction of
barcodes in situ has not been achieved. Here we report the development of an
artificial DNA recombination locus (termed Polylox) that enables broadly
applicable endogenous barcoding based on the Cre-loxP recombination system.
Polylox recombination in situ reaches a practical diversity of several hundred
thousand barcodes, allowing tagging of single cells. We have used this
experimental system, combined with fate mapping, to assess haematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) fates in vivo. Classical models of haematopoietic lineage
specification assume a tree with few major branches. More recently, driven in
part by the development of more efficient single-cell assays and improved
transplantation efficiencies, different models have been proposed, in which
unilineage priming may occur in mice and humans at the level of HSCs. We have
introduced barcodes into HSC progenitors in embryonic mice, and found that the
adult HSC compartment is a mosaic of embryo-derived HSC clones, some of which are
unexpectedly large. Most HSC clones gave rise to multilineage or oligolineage
fates, arguing against unilineage priming, and suggesting coherent usage of the
potential of cells in a clone. The spreading of barcodes, both after induction in
embryos and in adult mice, revealed a basic split between common
myeloid-erythroid development and common lymphocyte development, supporting the
long-held but contested view of a tree-like haematopoietic structure.

Synaptotagmin, complexin, and neuronal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive 
factor attachment protein receptor) proteins mediate evoked synchronous
neurotransmitter release, but the molecular mechanisms mediating the cooperation 
between these molecules remain unclear. Here we determine crystal structures of
the primed pre-fusion SNARE-complexin-synaptotagmin-1 complex. These structures
reveal an unexpected tripartite interface between synaptotagmin-1 and both the
SNARE complex and complexin. Simultaneously, a second synaptotagmin-1 molecule
interacts with the other side of the SNARE complex via the previously identified 
primary interface. Mutations that disrupt either interface in solution also
severely impair evoked synchronous release in neurons, suggesting that both
interfaces are essential for the primed pre-fusion state. Ca2+ binding to the
synaptotagmin-1 molecules unlocks the complex, allows full zippering of the SNARE
complex, and triggers membrane fusion. The tripartite
SNARE-complexin-synaptotagmin-1 complex at a synaptic vesicle docking site has to
be unlocked for triggered fusion to start, explaining the cooperation between
complexin and synaptotagmin-1 in synchronizing evoked release on the
sub-millisecond timescale.

Mutation enables evolution, but the idea that adaptation is also shaped by
mutational variation is controversial. Simple evolutionary hypotheses predict
such a relationship if the supply of mutations constrains evolution, but it is
not clear that constraints exist, and, even if they do, they may be overcome by
long-term natural selection. Quantification of the relationship between mutation 
and phenotypic divergence among species will help to resolve these issues. Here
we use precise data on over 50,000 Drosophilid fly wings to demonstrate
unexpectedly strong positive relationships between variation produced by
mutation, standing genetic variation, and the rate of evolution over the last 40 
million years. Our results are inconsistent with simple constraint hypotheses
because the rate of evolution is very low relative to what both mutational and
standing variation could allow. In principle, the constraint hypothesis could be 
rescued if the vast majority of mutations are so deleterious that they cannot
contribute to evolution, but this also requires the implausible assumption that
deleterious mutations have the same pattern of effects as potentially
advantageous ones. Our evidence for a strong relationship between mutation and
divergence in a slowly evolving structure challenges the existing models of
mutation in evolution.

Genome editing has potential for the targeted correction of germline mutations.
Here we describe the correction of the heterozygous MYBPC3 mutation in human
preimplantation embryos with precise CRISPR-Cas9-based targeting accuracy and
high homology-directed repair efficiency by activating an endogenous,
germline-specific DNA repair response. Induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the
mutant paternal allele were predominantly repaired using the homologous wild-type
maternal gene instead of a synthetic DNA template. By modulating the cell cycle
stage at which the DSB was induced, we were able to avoid mosaicism in cleaving
embryos and achieve a high yield of homozygous embryos carrying the wild-type
MYBPC3 gene without evidence of off-target mutations. The efficiency, accuracy
and safety of the approach presented suggest that it has potential to be used for
the correction of heritable mutations in human embryos by complementing
preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, much remains to be considered before 
clinical applications, including the reproducibility of the technique with other 
heterozygous mutations.

Inflammatory gene expression following genotoxic cancer therapy is well
documented, yet the events underlying its induction remain poorly understood.
Inflammatory cytokines modify the tumour microenvironment by recruiting immune
cells and are critical for both local and systemic (abscopal) tumour responses to
radiotherapy. A poorly understood feature of these responses is the delayed onset
(days), in contrast to the acute DNA-damage responses that occur in minutes to
hours. Such dichotomous kinetics implicate additional rate-limiting steps that
are essential for DNA-damage-induced inflammation. Here we show that cell cycle
progression through mitosis following double-stranded DNA breaks leads to the
formation of micronuclei, which precede activation of inflammatory signalling and
are a repository for the pattern-recognition receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
(cGAS). Inhibiting progression through mitosis or loss of pattern recognition by 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-cGAS impaired interferon signalling.
Moreover, STING loss prevented the regression of abscopal tumours in the context 
of ionizing radiation and immune checkpoint blockade in vivo. These findings
implicate temporal modulation of the cell cycle as an important consideration in 
the context of therapeutic strategies that combine genotoxic agents with immune
checkpoint blockade.

DNA is strictly compartmentalized within the nucleus to prevent autoimmunity;
despite this, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic sensor of
double-stranded DNA, is activated in autoinflammatory disorders and by DNA
damage. Precisely how cellular DNA gains access to the cytoplasm remains to be
determined. Here, we report that cGAS localizes to micronuclei arising from
genome instability in a mouse model of monogenic autoinflammation, after
exogenous DNA damage and spontaneously in human cancer cells. Such micronuclei
occur after mis-segregation of DNA during cell division and consist of chromatin 
surrounded by its own nuclear membrane. Breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a
process associated with chromothripsis, leads to rapid accumulation of cGAS,
providing a mechanism by which self-DNA becomes exposed to the cytosol. cGAS is
activated by chromatin, and consistent with a mitotic origin, micronuclei
formation and the proinflammatory response following DNA damage are cell-cycle
dependent. By combining live-cell laser microdissection with single cell
transcriptomics, we establish that interferon-stimulated gene expression is
induced in micronucleated cells. We therefore conclude that micronuclei represent
an important source of immunostimulatory DNA. As micronuclei formed from lagging 
chromosomes also activate this pathway, recognition of micronuclei by cGAS may
act as a cell-intrinsic immune surveillance mechanism that detects a range of
neoplasia-inducing processes.

Semiconductor nanowires are ideal for realizing various low-dimensional quantum
devices. In particular, topological phases of matter hosting non-Abelian
quasiparticles (such as anyons) can emerge when a semiconductor nanowire with
strong spin-orbit coupling is brought into contact with a superconductor. To
exploit the potential of non-Abelian anyons-which are key elements of topological
quantum computing-fully, they need to be exchanged in a well-controlled braiding 
operation. Essential hardware for braiding is a network of crystalline nanowires 
coupled to superconducting islands. Here we demonstrate a technique for generic
bottom-up synthesis of complex quantum devices with a special focus on nanowire
networks with a predefined number of superconducting islands. Structural analysis
confirms the high crystalline quality of the nanowire junctions, as well as an
epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor interface. Quantum transport measurements 
of nanowire 'hashtags' reveal Aharonov-Bohm and weak-antilocalization effects,
indicating a phase-coherent system with strong spin-orbit coupling. In addition, 
a proximity-induced hard superconducting gap (with vanishing sub-gap conductance)
is demonstrated in these hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires,
highlighting the successful materials development necessary for a first braiding 
experiment. Our approach opens up new avenues for the realization of epitaxial
three-dimensional quantum architectures which have the potential to become key
components of various quantum devices.

The direct detection of gravitational waves from merging binary black holes opens
up a window into the environments in which binary black holes form. One signature
of such environments is the angular distribution of the black hole spins. Binary 
systems that formed through dynamical interactions between already-compact
objects are expected to have isotropic spin orientations (that is, the spins of
the black holes are randomly oriented with respect to the orbit of the binary
system), whereas those that formed from pairs of stars born together are more
likely to have spins that are preferentially aligned with the orbit. The
best-measured combination of spin parameters for each of the four likely binary
black hole detections GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226 and GW170104 is the
'effective' spin. Here we report that, if the magnitudes of the black hole spins 
are allowed to extend to high values, the effective spins for these systems
indicate a 0.015 odds ratio against an aligned angular distribution compared to
an isotropic one. When considering the effect of ten additional detections, this 
odds ratio decreases to 2.9 × 10-7 against alignment. The existing preference for
either an isotropic spin distribution or low spin magnitudes for the observed
systems will be confirmed (or overturned) confidently in the near future.

Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas and plays a key part in global
atmospheric chemistry. Natural geological emissions (fossil methane vented
naturally from marine and terrestrial seeps and mud volcanoes) are thought to
contribute around 52 teragrams of methane per year to the global methane source, 
about 10 per cent of the total, but both bottom-up methods (measuring emissions) 
and top-down approaches (measuring atmospheric mole fractions and isotopes) for
constraining these geological emissions have been associated with large
uncertainties. Here we use ice core measurements to quantify the absolute amount 
of radiocarbon-containing methane (14CH4) in the past atmosphere and show that
geological methane emissions were no higher than 15.4 teragrams per year (95 per 
cent confidence), averaged over the abrupt warming event that occurred between
the Younger Dryas and Preboreal intervals, approximately 11,600 years ago.
Assuming that past geological methane emissions were no lower than today, our
results indicate that current estimates of today's natural geological methane
emissions (about 52 teragrams per year) are too high and, by extension, that
current estimates of anthropogenic fossil methane emissions are too low. Our
results also improve on and confirm earlier findings that the rapid increase of
about 50 per cent in mole fraction of atmospheric methane at the Younger
Dryas-Preboreal event was driven by contemporaneous methane from sources such as 
wetlands; our findings constrain the contribution from old carbon reservoirs
(marine methane hydrates, permafrost and methane trapped under ice) to 19 per
cent or less (95 per cent confidence). To the extent that the characteristics of 
the most recent deglaciation and the Younger Dryas-Preboreal warming are
comparable to those of the current anthropogenic warming, our measurements
suggest that large future atmospheric releases of methane from old carbon sources
are unlikely to occur.

Lanthanides have been investigated extensively for potential applications in
quantum information processing and high-density data storage at the molecular and
atomic scale. Experimental achievements include reading and manipulating single
nuclear spins, exploiting atomic clock transitions for robust qubits and, most
recently, magnetic data storage in single atoms. Single-molecule magnets exhibit 
magnetic hysteresis of molecular origin-a magnetic memory effect and a
prerequisite of data storage-and so far lanthanide examples have exhibited this
phenomenon at the highest temperatures. However, in the nearly 25 years since the
discovery of single-molecule magnets, hysteresis temperatures have increased from
4 kelvin to only about 14 kelvin using a consistent magnetic field sweep rate of 
about 20 oersted per second, although higher temperatures have been achieved by
using very fast sweep rates (for example, 30 kelvin with 200 oersted per second).
Here we report a hexa-tert-butyldysprosocenium complex-[Dy(Cpttt)2][B(C6F5)4],
with Cpttt = {C5H2tBu3-1,2,4} and tBu = C(CH3)3-which exhibits magnetic
hysteresis at temperatures of up to 60 kelvin at a sweep rate of 22 oersted per
second. We observe a clear change in the relaxation dynamics at this temperature,
which persists in magnetically diluted samples, suggesting that the origin of the
hysteresis is the localized metal-ligand vibrational modes that are unique to
dysprosocenium. Ab initio calculations of spin dynamics demonstrate that magnetic
relaxation at high temperatures is due to local molecular vibrations. These
results indicate that, with judicious molecular design, magnetic data storage in 
single molecules at temperatures above liquid nitrogen should be possible.

A fundamental principle in biology is that the program for early development is
established during oogenesis in the form of the maternal transcriptome. How the
maternal transcriptome acquires the appropriate content and dosage of transcripts
is not fully understood. Here we show that 3' terminal uridylation of mRNA
mediated by TUT4 and TUT7 sculpts the mouse maternal transcriptome by eliminating
transcripts during oocyte growth. Uridylation mediated by TUT4 and TUT7 is
essential for both oocyte maturation and fertility. In comparison to somatic
cells, the oocyte transcriptome has a shorter poly(A) tail and a higher relative 
proportion of terminal oligo-uridylation. Deletion of TUT4 and TUT7 leads to the 
accumulation of a cohort of transcripts with a high frequency of very short
poly(A) tails, and a loss of 3' oligo-uridylation. By contrast, deficiency of
TUT4 and TUT7 does not alter gene expression in a variety of somatic cells. In
summary, we show that poly(A) tail length and 3' terminal uridylation have
essential and specific functions in shaping a functional maternal transcriptome.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common and abundant messenger RNA
modification, modulated by 'writers', 'erasers' and 'readers' of this mark. In
vitro data have shown that m6A influences all fundamental aspects of mRNA
metabolism, mainly mRNA stability, to determine stem cell fates. However, its in 
vivo physiological function in mammals and adult mammalian cells is still
unknown. Here we show that the deletion of m6A 'writer' protein METTL3 in mouse T
cells disrupts T cell homeostasis and differentiation. In a lymphopaenic mouse
adoptive transfer model, naive Mettl3-deficient T cells failed to undergo
homeostatic expansion and remained in the naive state for up to 12 weeks, thereby
preventing colitis. Consistent with these observations, the mRNAs of SOCS family 
genes encoding the STAT signalling inhibitory proteins SOCS1, SOCS3 and CISH were
marked by m6A, exhibited slower mRNA decay and showed increased mRNAs and levels 
of protein expression in Mettl3-deficient naive T cells. This increased SOCS
family activity consequently inhibited IL-7-mediated STAT5 activation and T cell 
homeostatic proliferation and differentiation. We also found that m6A has
important roles for inducible degradation of Socs mRNAs in response to IL-7
signalling in order to reprogram naive T cells for proliferation and
differentiation. Our study elucidates for the first time, to our knowledge, the
in vivo biological role of m6A modification in T-cell-mediated pathogenesis and
reveals a novel mechanism of T cell homeostasis and signal-dependent induction of
mRNA degradation.

In mammals, taste buds typically contain 50-100 tightly packed taste-receptor
cells (TRCs), representing all five basic qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty
and umami. Notably, mature taste cells have life spans of only 5-20 days and,
consequently, are constantly replenished by differentiation of taste stem cells. 
Given the importance of establishing and maintaining appropriate connectivity
between TRCs and their partner ganglion neurons (that is, ensuring that a
labelled line from sweet TRCs connects to sweet neurons, bitter TRCs to bitter
neurons, sour to sour, and so on), we examined how new connections are specified 
to retain fidelity of signal transmission. Here we show that bitter and sweet
TRCs provide instructive signals to bitter and sweet target neurons via different
guidance molecules (SEMA3A and SEMA7A). We demonstrate that targeted expression
of SEMA3A or SEMA7A in different classes of TRCs produces peripheral taste
systems with miswired sweet or bitter cells. Indeed, we engineered mice with
bitter neurons that now responded to sweet tastants, sweet neurons that responded
to bitter or sweet neurons responding to sour stimuli. Together, these results
uncover the basic logic of the wiring of the taste system at the periphery, and
illustrate how a labelled-line sensory circuit preserves signalling integrity
despite rapid and stochastic turnover of receptor cells.

Stem mammaliaforms are forerunners to modern mammals, and they achieved
considerable ecomorphological diversity in their own right. Recent discoveries
suggest that eleutherodontids, a subclade of Haramiyida, were more species-rich
during the Jurassic period in Asia than previously recognized. Here we report a
new Jurassic eleutherodontid mammaliaform with an unusual mosaic of highly
specialized characteristics, and the results of phylogenetic analyses that
support the hypothesis that haramiyidans are stem mammaliaforms. The new fossil
shows fossilized skin membranes that are interpreted to be for gliding and a
mandibular middle ear with a unique character combination previously unknown in
mammaliaforms. Incisor replacement is prolonged until well after molars are fully
erupted, a timing pattern unique to most other mammaliaforms. In situ molar
occlusion and a functional analysis reveal a new mode of dental occlusion: dual
mortar-pestle occlusion of opposing upper and lower molars, probably for dual
crushing and grinding. This suggests that eleutherodontids are herbivorous, and
probably specialized for granivory or feeding on soft plant tissues. The inferred
dietary adaptation of eleutherodontid gliders represents a remarkable
evolutionary convergence with herbivorous gliders in Theria. These Jurassic
fossils represent volant, herbivorous stem mammaliaforms associated with
pre-angiosperm plants that appear long before the later, iterative associations
between angiosperm plants and volant herbivores in various therian clades.

Genetic evidence for anatomically modern humans (AMH) out of Africa before 75
thousand years ago (ka) and in island southeast Asia (ISEA) before 60 ka
(93-61 ka) predates accepted archaeological records of occupation in the region. 
Claims that AMH arrived in ISEA before 60 ka (ref. 4) have been supported only by
equivocal or non-skeletal evidence. AMH evidence from this period is rare and
lacks robust chronologies owing to a lack of direct dating applications, poor
preservation and/or excavation strategies and questionable taxonomic
identifications. Lida Ajer is a Sumatran Pleistocene cave with a rich rainforest 
fauna associated with fossil human teeth. The importance of the site is unclear
owing to unsupported taxonomic identification of these fossils and uncertainties 
regarding the age of the deposit, therefore it is rarely considered in models of 
human dispersal. Here we reinvestigate Lida Ajer to identify the teeth
confidently and establish a robust chronology using an integrated dating
approach. Using enamel-dentine junction morphology, enamel thickness and
comparative morphology, we show that the teeth are unequivocally AMH.
Luminescence and uranium-series techniques applied to bone-bearing sediments and 
speleothems, and coupled uranium-series and electron spin resonance dating of
mammalian teeth, place modern humans in Sumatra between 73 and 63 ka. This age is
consistent with biostratigraphic estimations, palaeoclimate and sea-level
reconstructions, and genetic evidence for a pre-60 ka arrival of AMH into ISEA.
Lida Ajer represents, to our knowledge, the earliest evidence of rainforest
occupation by AMH, and underscores the importance of reassessing the timing and
environmental context of the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid composed of a phosphate group, a
glycerol backbone, and a single acyl chain that varies in length and saturation. 
LPA activates six class A G-protein-coupled receptors to provoke various cellular
reactions. Because LPA signalling has been implicated in cancer and fibrosis, the
LPA receptors are regarded as promising drug targets. The six LPA receptors are
subdivided into the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family (LPA1-LPA3) and
the phylogenetically distant non-EDG family (LPA4-LPA6). The structure of LPA1
has enhanced our understanding of the EDG family of LPA receptors. By contrast,
the functional and pharmacological characteristics of the non-EDG family of LPA
receptors have remained unknown, owing to the lack of structural information.
Although the non-EDG LPA receptors share sequence similarity with the P2Y family 
of nucleotide receptors, the LPA recognition mechanism cannot be deduced from the
P2Y1 and P2Y12 structures because of the large differences in the chemical
structures of their ligands. Here we determine the 3.2 Å crystal structure of
LPA6, the gene deletion of which is responsible for congenital hair loss, to
clarify the ligand recognition mechanism of the non-EDG family of LPA receptors. 
Notably, the ligand-binding pocket of LPA6 is laterally open towards the
membrane, and the acyl chain of the lipid used for the crystallization is bound
within this pocket, indicating the binding mode of the LPA acyl chain. Docking
and mutagenesis analyses also indicated that the conserved positively charged
residues within the central cavity recognize the phosphate head group of LPA by
inducing an inward shift of transmembrane helices 6 and 7, suggesting that the
receptor activation is triggered by this conformational rearrangement.

Chaotic dynamics in nanoscale NbO2 Mott memristors for analogue computing.

Kumar S, Strachan JP, Williams RS.

At present, machine learning systems use simplified neuron models that lack the
rich nonlinear phenomena observed in biological systems, which display
spatio-temporal cooperative dynamics. There is evidence that neurons operate in a
regime called the edge of chaos that may be central to complexity, learning
efficiency, adaptability and analogue (non-Boolean) computation in brains. Neural
networks have exhibited enhanced computational complexity when operated at the
edge of chaos, and networks of chaotic elements have been proposed for solving
combinatorial or global optimization problems. Thus, a source of controllable
chaotic behaviour that can be incorporated into a neural-inspired circuit may be 
an essential component of future computational systems. Such chaotic elements
have been simulated using elaborate transistor circuits that simulate known
equations of chaos, but an experimental realization of chaotic dynamics from a
single scalable electronic device has been lacking. Here we describe niobium
dioxide (NbO2) Mott memristors each less than 100 nanometres across that exhibit 
both a nonlinear-transport-driven current-controlled negative differential
resistance and a Mott-transition-driven temperature-controlled negative
differential resistance. Mott materials have a temperature-dependent
metal-insulator transition that acts as an electronic switch, which introduces a 
history-dependent resistance into the device. We incorporate these memristors
into a relaxation oscillator and observe a tunable range of periodic and chaotic 
self-oscillations. We show that the nonlinear current transport coupled with
thermal fluctuations at the nanoscale generates chaotic oscillations. Such
memristors could be useful in certain types of neural-inspired computation by
introducing a pseudo-random signal that prevents global synchronization and could
also assist in finding a global minimum during a constrained search. We
specifically demonstrate that incorporating such memristors into the hardware of 
a Hopfield computing network can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of
converging to a solution for computationally difficult problems.

Stem mammaliaforms are Mesozoic forerunners to mammals, and they offer critical
evidence for the anatomical evolution and ecological diversification during the
earliest mammalian history. Two new eleutherodonts from the Late Jurassic period 
have skin membranes and skeletal features that are adapted for gliding.
Characteristics of their digits provide evidence of roosting behaviour, as in
dermopterans and bats, and their feet have a calcaneal calcar to support the
uropagatium as in bats. The new volant taxa are phylogenetically nested with
arboreal eleutherodonts. Together, they show an evolutionary experimentation
similar to the iterative evolutions of gliders within arboreal groups of
marsupial and placental mammals. However, gliding eleutherodonts possess rigid
interclavicle-clavicle structures, convergent to the avian furculum, and they
retain shoulder girdle plesiomorphies of mammaliaforms and monotremes. Forelimb
mobility required by gliding occurs at the acromion-clavicle and glenohumeral
joints, is different from and convergent to the shoulder mobility at the pivotal 
clavicle-sternal joint in marsupial and placental gliders.

Mammalian genomes contain thousands of loci that transcribe long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs), some of which are known to carry out critical roles in diverse
cellular processes through a variety of mechanisms. Although some lncRNA loci
encode RNAs that act non-locally (in trans), there is emerging evidence that many
lncRNA loci act locally (in cis) to regulate the expression of nearby genes-for
example, through functions of the lncRNA promoter, transcription, or transcript
itself. Despite their potentially important roles, it remains challenging to
identify functional lncRNA loci and distinguish among these and other mechanisms.
Here, to address these challenges, we developed a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9
activation screen that targets more than 10,000 lncRNA transcriptional start
sites to identify noncoding loci that influence a phenotype of interest. We found
11 lncRNA loci that, upon recruitment of an activator, mediate resistance to BRAF
inhibitors in human melanoma cells. Most candidate loci appear to regulate nearby
genes. Detailed analysis of one candidate, termed EMICERI, revealed that its
transcriptional activation resulted in dosage-dependent activation of four
neighbouring protein-coding genes, one of which confers the resistance phenotype.
Our screening and characterization approach provides a CRISPR toolkit with which 
to systematically discover the functions of noncoding loci and elucidate their
diverse roles in gene regulation and cellular function.

Cells in healthy tissues acquire mutations with surprising frequency. Many of
these mutations are associated with abnormal cellular behaviours such as
differentiation defects and hyperproliferation, yet fail to produce
macroscopically detectable phenotypes. It is currently unclear how the tissue
remains phenotypically normal, despite the presence of these mutant cells. Here
we use intravital imaging to track the fate of mouse skin epithelium burdened
with varying numbers of activated Wnt/β-catenin stem cells. We show that all
resulting growths that deform the skin tissue architecture regress, irrespective 
of their size. Wild-type cells are required for the active elimination of mutant 
cells from the tissue, while utilizing both endogenous and ectopic cellular
behaviours to dismantle the aberrant structures. After regression, the remaining 
structures are either completely eliminated or converted into functional skin
appendages in a niche-dependent manner. Furthermore, tissue aberrancies generated
from oncogenic Hras, and even mutation-independent deformations to the tissue,
can also be corrected, indicating that this tolerance phenomenon reflects a
conserved principle in the skin. This study reveals an unanticipated plasticity
of the adult skin epithelium when faced with mutational and non-mutational
insult, and elucidates the dynamic cellular behaviours used for its return to a
homeostatic state.

Electronic nematic materials are characterized by a lowered symmetry of the
electronic system compared to the underlying lattice, in analogy to the
directional alignment without translational order in nematic liquid crystals.
Such nematic phases appear in the copper- and iron-based high-temperature
superconductors, and their role in establishing superconductivity remains an open
question. Nematicity may take an active part, cooperating or competing with
superconductivity, or may appear accidentally in such systems. Here we present
experimental evidence for a phase of fluctuating nematic character in a
heavy-fermion superconductor, CeRhIn5 (ref. 5). We observe a
magnetic-field-induced state in the vicinity of a field-tuned antiferromagnetic
quantum critical point at Hc ≈ 50 tesla. This phase appears above an out-of-plane
critical field H* ≈ 28 tesla and is characterized by a substantial in-plane
resistivity anisotropy in the presence of a small in-plane field component. The
in-plane symmetry breaking has little apparent connection to the underlying
lattice, as evidenced by the small magnitude of the magnetostriction anomaly at
H*. Furthermore, no anomalies appear in the magnetic torque, suggesting the
absence of metamagnetism in this field range. The appearance of nematic behaviour
in a prototypical heavy-fermion superconductor highlights the interrelation of
nematicity and unconventional superconductivity, suggesting nematicity to be
common among correlated materials.

Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. Although The Cancer
Genome Atlas has sequenced primary tumour types obtained from surgical
resections, much less comprehensive molecular analysis is available from
clinically acquired metastatic cancers. Here we perform whole-exome and
-transcriptome sequencing of 500 adult patients with metastatic solid tumours of 
diverse lineage and biopsy site. The most prevalent genes somatically altered in 
metastatic cancer included TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and RB1. Putative
pathogenic germline variants were present in 12.2% of cases of which 75% were
related to defects in DNA repair. RNA sequencing complemented DNA sequencing to
identify gene fusions, pathway activation, and immune profiling. Our results show
that integrative sequence analysis provides a clinically relevant,
multi-dimensional view of the complex molecular landscape and microenvironment of
metastatic cancers.

Misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins are retro-translocated through the
membrane into the cytosol, where they are poly-ubiquitinated, extracted from the 
membrane, and degraded by the proteasome-a pathway termed endoplasmic
reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Proteins with misfolded domains 
in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen or membrane are discarded through the ERAD-L
and ERAD-M pathways, respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both pathways
require the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, a multi-spanning membrane protein with a
cytosolic RING finger domain. Hrd1 is the crucial membrane component for
retro-translocation, but it is unclear whether it forms a protein-conducting
channel. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of S. cerevisiae
Hrd1 in complex with its endoplasmic reticulum luminal binding partner, Hrd3.
Hrd1 forms a dimer within the membrane with one or two Hrd3 molecules associated 
at its luminal side. Each Hrd1 molecule has eight transmembrane segments, five of
which form an aqueous cavity extending from the cytosol almost to the endoplasmic
reticulum lumen, while a segment of the neighbouring Hrd1 molecule forms a
lateral seal. The aqueous cavity and lateral gate are reminiscent of features of 
protein-conducting conduits that facilitate polypeptide movement in the opposite 
direction-from the cytosol into or across membranes. Our results suggest that
Hrd1 forms a retro-translocation channel for the movement of misfolded
polypeptides through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

massive than about nine solar masses, in which they develop complex,
multi-component atmospheres. Bright spots have been detected in the atmosphere of
red supergiants using interferometric imaging. Above the photosphere of a red
supergiant, the molecular outer atmosphere extends up to about two stellar radii.
Furthermore, the hot chromosphere (5,000 to 8,000 kelvin) and cool gas (less than
3,500 kelvin) of a red supergiant coexist at about three stellar radii. The
dynamics of such complex atmospheres has been probed by ultraviolet and optical
spectroscopy. The most direct approach, however, is to measure the velocity of
gas at each position over the image of stars as in observations of the Sun. Here 
we report the mapping of the velocity field over the surface and atmosphere of
the nearby red supergiant Antares. The two-dimensional velocity field map
obtained from our near-infrared spectro-interferometric imaging reveals vigorous 
upwelling and downdrafting motions of several huge gas clumps at velocities
ranging from about -20 to +20 kilometres per second in the atmosphere, which
extends out to about 1.7 stellar radii. Convection alone cannot explain the
observed turbulent motions and atmospheric extension, suggesting that an
unidentified process is operating in the extended atmosphere.

When a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy accretes matter, it
gives rise to a highly energetic phenomenon: an active galactic nucleus. Numerous
physical processes have been proposed to account for the funnelling of gas
towards the galactic centre to feed the black hole. There are also several
physical processes that can remove gas from a galaxy, one of which is
ram-pressure stripping by the hot gas that fills the space between galaxies in
galaxy clusters. Here we report that six out of a sample of seven 'jellyfish'
galaxies-galaxies with long 'tentacles' of material that extend for dozens of
kiloparsecs beyond the galactic disks-host an active nucleus, and two of them
also have galactic-scale ionization cones. The high incidence of nuclear activity
among heavily stripped jellyfish galaxies may be due to ram pressure causing gas 
to flow towards the centre and triggering the activity, or to an enhancement of
the stripping caused by energy injection from the active nucleus, or both. Our
analysis of the galactic position and velocity relative to the cluster strongly
supports the first hypothesis, and puts forward ram pressure as another possible 
mechanism for feeding the central supermassive black hole with gas.

Metabolism has been shown to integrate with epigenetics and transcription to
modulate cell fate and function. Beyond meeting the bioenergetic and biosynthetic
demands of T-cell differentiation, whether metabolism might control T-cell fate
by an epigenetic mechanism is unclear. Here, through the discovery and
mechanistic characterization of a small molecule, (aminooxy)acetic acid, that
reprograms the differentiation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells towards induced
regulatory T (iTreg) cells, we show that increased transamination, mainly
catalysed by GOT1, leads to increased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate in
differentiating TH17 cells. The accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate resulted in
hypermethylation of the Foxp3 gene locus and inhibited Foxp3 transcription, which
is essential for fate determination towards TH17 cells. Inhibition of the
conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutaric acid prevented the production of
2-hydroxyglutarate, reduced methylation of the Foxp3 gene locus, and increased
Foxp3 expression. This consequently blocked the differentiation of TH17 cells by 
antagonizing the function of transcription factor RORγt and promoted polarization
into iTreg cells. Selective inhibition of GOT1 with (aminooxy)acetic acid
ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in a therapeutic mouse
model by regulating the balance between TH17 and iTreg cells. Targeting a
glutamate-dependent metabolic pathway thus represents a new strategy for
developing therapeutic agents against TH17-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Pollinators are declining worldwide and this has raised concerns for a parallel
decline in the essential pollination service they provide to both crops and wild 
plants. Anthropogenic drivers linked to this decline include habitat changes,
intensive agriculture, pesticides, invasive alien species, spread of pathogens
and climate change. Recently, the rapid global increase in artificial light at
night has been proposed to be a new threat to terrestrial ecosystems; the
consequences of this increase for ecosystem function are mostly unknown. Here we 
show that artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal pollination networks and
has negative consequences for plant reproductive success. In artificially
illuminated plant-pollinator communities, nocturnal visits to plants were reduced
by 62% compared to dark areas. Notably, this resulted in an overall 13% reduction
in fruit set of a focal plant even though the plant also received numerous visits
by diurnal pollinators. Furthermore, by merging diurnal and nocturnal pollination
sub-networks, we show that the structure of these combined networks tends to
facilitate the spread of the negative consequences of disrupted nocturnal
pollination to daytime pollinator communities. Our findings demonstrate that
artificial light at night is a threat to pollination and that the negative
effects of artificial light at night on nocturnal pollination are predicted to
propagate to the diurnal community, thereby aggravating the decline of the
diurnal community. We provide perspectives on the functioning of plant-pollinator
communities, showing that nocturnal pollinators are not redundant to diurnal
communities and increasing our understanding of the human-induced decline in
pollinators and their ecosystem service.

The origins of the Bronze Age Minoan and Mycenaean cultures have puzzled
archaeologists for more than a century. We have assembled genome-wide data from
19 ancient individuals, including Minoans from Crete, Mycenaeans from mainland
Greece, and their eastern neighbours from southwestern Anatolia. Here we show
that Minoans and Mycenaeans were genetically similar, having at least
three-quarters of their ancestry from the first Neolithic farmers of western
Anatolia and the Aegean, and most of the remainder from ancient populations
related to those of the Caucasus and Iran. However, the Mycenaeans differed from 
Minoans in deriving additional ancestry from an ultimate source related to the
hunter-gatherers of eastern Europe and Siberia, introduced via a proximal source 
related to the inhabitants of either the Eurasian steppe or Armenia. Modern
Greeks resemble the Mycenaeans, but with some additional dilution of the Early
Neolithic ancestry. Our results support the idea of continuity but not isolation 
in the history of populations of the Aegean, before and after the time of its
earliest civilizations.

The self-association of proteins into symmetric complexes is ubiquitous in all
kingdoms of life. Symmetric complexes possess unique geometric and functional
properties, but their internal symmetry can pose a risk. In sickle-cell disease, 
the symmetry of haemoglobin exacerbates the effect of a mutation, triggering
assembly into harmful fibrils. Here we examine the universality of this mechanism
and its relation to protein structure geometry. We introduced point mutations
solely designed to increase surface hydrophobicity among 12 distinct symmetric
complexes from Escherichia coli. Notably, all responded by forming supramolecular
assemblies in vitro, as well as in vivo upon heterologous expression in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Remarkably, in four cases, micrometre-long fibrils
formed in vivo in response to a single point mutation. Biophysical measurements
and electron microscopy revealed that mutants self-assembled in their folded
states and so were not amyloid-like. Structural examination of 73 mutants
identified supramolecular assembly hot spots predictable by geometry. A
subsequent structural analysis of 7,471 symmetric complexes showed that geometric
hot spots were buffered chemically by hydrophilic residues, suggesting a
mechanism preventing mis-assembly of these regions. Thus, point mutations can
frequently trigger folded proteins to self-assemble into higher-order structures.
This potential is counterbalanced by negative selection and can be exploited to
design nanomaterials in living cells.

The initiating oncogenic event in almost half of human lung adenocarcinomas is
still unknown, a fact that complicates the development of selective targeted
therapies. Yet these tumours harbour a number of alterations without obvious
oncogenic function including BRAF-inactivating mutations. Inactivating BRAF
mutants in lung predominate over the activating V600E mutant that is frequently
observed in other tumour types. Here we demonstrate that the expression of an
endogenous Braf(D631A) kinase-inactive isoform in mice (corresponding to the
human BRAF(D594A) mutation) triggers lung adenocarcinoma in vivo, indicating that
BRAF-inactivating mutations are initiating events in lung oncogenesis. Moreover, 
inactivating BRAF mutations have also been identified in a subset of KRAS-driven 
human lung tumours. Co-expression of Kras(G12V) and Braf(D631A) in mouse lung
cells markedly enhances tumour initiation, a phenomenon mediated by Craf kinase
activity, and effectively accelerates tumour progression when activated in
advanced lung adenocarcinomas. We also report a key role for the wild-type Braf
kinase in sustaining Kras(G12V)/Braf(D631A)-driven tumours. Ablation of the
wild-type Braf allele prevents the development of lung adenocarcinoma by inducing
a further increase in MAPK signalling that results in oncogenic toxicity; this
effect can be abolished by pharmacological inhibition of Mek to restore tumour
growth. However, the loss of wild-type Braf also induces transdifferentiation of 
club cells, which leads to the rapid development of lethal intrabronchiolar
lesions. These observations indicate that the signal intensity of the MAPK
pathway is a critical determinant not only in tumour development, but also in
dictating the nature of the cancer-initiating cell and ultimately the resulting
tumour phenotype.

Approximately 200 BRAF mutant alleles have been identified in human tumours.
Activating BRAF mutants cause feedback inhibition of GTP-bound RAS, are
RAS-independent and signal either as active monomers (class 1) or constitutively 
active dimers (class 2). Here we characterize a third class of BRAF mutants-those
that have impaired kinase activity or are kinase-dead. These mutants are
sensitive to ERK-mediated feedback and their activation of signalling is
RAS-dependent. The mutants bind more tightly than wild-type BRAF to RAS-GTP, and 
their binding to and activation of wild-type CRAF is enhanced, leading to
increased ERK signalling. The model suggests that dysregulation of signalling by 
these mutants in tumours requires coexistent mechanisms for maintaining RAS
activation despite ERK-dependent feedback. Consistent with this hypothesis,
melanomas with these class 3 BRAF mutations also harbour RAS mutations or NF1
deletions. By contrast, in lung and colorectal cancers with class 3 BRAF mutants,
RAS is typically activated by receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. These tumours 
are sensitive to the inhibition of RAS activation by inhibitors of receptor
tyrosine kinases. We have thus defined three distinct functional classes of BRAF 
mutants in human tumours. The mutants activate ERK signalling by different
mechanisms that dictate their sensitivity to therapeutic inhibitors of the
pathway.

Crystallization of colloidal nanocrystals into superlattices represents a
practical bottom-up process with which to create ordered metamaterials with
emergent functionalities. With precise control over the size, shape and
composition of individual nanocrystals, various single- and multi-component
nanocrystal superlattices have been produced, the lattice structures and chemical
compositions of which can be accurately engineered. Nanocrystal superlattices are
typically prepared by carefully controlling the assembly process through solvent 
evaporation or destabilization or through DNA-guided crystallization. Slow
solvent evaporation or cooling of nanocrystal solutions (over hours or days) is
the key element for successful crystallization processes. Here we report the
rapid growth (seconds) of micrometre-sized, face-centred-cubic, three-dimensional
nanocrystal superlattices during colloidal synthesis at high temperatures (more
than 230 degrees Celsius). Using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering, we observe
continuous growth of individual nanocrystals within the lattices, which results
in simultaneous lattice expansion and fine nanocrystal size control due to the
superlattice templates. Thermodynamic models demonstrate that balanced attractive
and repulsive interparticle interactions dictated by the ligand coverage on
nanocrystal surfaces and nanocrystal core size are responsible for the
crystallization process. The interparticle interactions can also be controlled to
form different superlattice structures, such as hexagonal close-packed lattices. 
The rational assembly of various nanocrystal systems into novel materials is thus
facilitated for both fundamental research and for practical applications in the
fields of magnetics, electronics and catalysis.

Concomitant activation of the Wnt pathway and suppression of Mapk signalling by
two small molecule inhibitors (2i) in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor
(LIF) (hereafter termed 2i/L) induces a naive state in mouse embryonic stem (ES) 
cells that resembles the inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation embryo.
Since the ICM exists only transiently in vivo, it remains unclear how sustained
propagation of naive ES cells in vitro affects their stability and functionality.
Here we show that prolonged culture of male mouse ES cells in 2i/L results in
irreversible epigenetic and genomic changes that impair their developmental
potential. Furthermore, we find that female ES cells cultured in conventional
serum plus LIF medium phenocopy male ES cells cultured in 2i/L. Mechanistically, 
we demonstrate that the inhibition of Mek1/2 is predominantly responsible for
these effects, in part through the downregulation of DNA methyltransferases and
their cofactors. Finally, we show that replacement of the Mek1/2 inhibitor with a
Src inhibitor preserves the epigenetic and genomic integrity as well as the
developmental potential of ES cells. Taken together, our data suggest that,
although short-term suppression of Mek1/2 in ES cells helps to maintain an
ICM-like epigenetic state, prolonged suppression results in irreversible changes 
that compromise their developmental potential.

Inhibitors of Mek1/2 and Gsk3β, known as 2i, enhance the derivation of embryonic 
stem (ES) cells and promote ground-state pluripotency in rodents. Here we show
that the derivation of female mouse ES cells in the presence of 2i and leukaemia 
inhibitory factor (2i/L ES cells) results in a widespread loss of DNA
methylation, including a massive erasure of genomic imprints. Despite this global
loss of DNA methylation, early-passage 2i/L ES cells efficiently differentiate
into somatic cells, and this process requires genome-wide de novo DNA
methylation. However, the majority of imprinting control regions (ICRs) remain
unmethylated in 2i/L-ES-cell-derived differentiated cells. Consistently, 2i/L ES 
cells exhibit impaired autonomous embryonic and placental development by
tetraploid embryo complementation or nuclear transplantation. We identified the
derivation conditions of female ES cells that display 2i/L-ES-cell-like
transcriptional signatures while preserving gamete-derived DNA methylation and
autonomous developmental potential. Upon prolonged culture, however, female ES
cells exhibited ICR demethylation regardless of culture conditions. Our results
provide insights into the derivation of female ES cells reminiscent of the inner 
cell mass of preimplantation embryos.

Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity
observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting
competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological
communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact 
and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically 
small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation
between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models 
allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting
competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist
thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the
presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although 
higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping
ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order
interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species
coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter
values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of
closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new
species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions
are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical
parameterization and validation of our models.

Planet formation theories predict that some planets may be ejected from their
parent systems as result of dynamical interactions and other processes. Unbound
planets can also be formed through gravitational collapse, in a way similar to
that in which stars form. A handful of free-floating planetary-mass objects have 
been discovered by infrared surveys of young stellar clusters and star-forming
regions as well as wide-field surveys, but these studies are incomplete for
objects below five Jupiter masses. Gravitational microlensing is the only method 
capable of exploring the entire population of free-floating planets down to
Mars-mass objects, because the microlensing signal does not depend on the
brightness of the lensing object. A characteristic timescale of microlensing
events depends on the mass of the lens: the less massive the lens, the shorter
the microlensing event. A previous analysis of 474 microlensing events found an
excess of ten very short events (1-2 days)-more than known stellar populations
would suggest-indicating the existence of a large population of unbound or
wide-orbit Jupiter-mass planets (reported to be almost twice as common as
main-sequence stars). These results, however, do not match predictions of
planet-formation theories and surveys of young clusters. Here we analyse a sample
of microlensing events six times larger than that of ref. 11 discovered during
the years 2010-15. Although our survey has very high sensitivity (detection
efficiency) to short-timescale (1-2 days) microlensing events, we found no excess
of events with timescales in this range, with a 95 per cent upper limit on the
frequency of Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planets per
main-sequence star. We detected a few possible ultrashort-timescale events (with 
timescales of less than half a day), which may indicate the existence of
Earth-mass and super-Earth-mass free-floating planets, as predicted by
planet-formation theories.

Drought, a recurring phenomenon with major impacts on both human and natural
systems, is the most widespread climatic extreme that negatively affects the land
carbon sink. Although twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous, 
across many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in the
twenty-first century. Recovery time-how long an ecosystem requires to revert to
its pre-drought functional state-is a critical metric of drought impact. Yet the 
factors influencing drought recovery and its spatiotemporal patterns at the
global scale are largely unknown. Here we analyse three independent datasets of
gross primary productivity and show that, across diverse ecosystems, drought
recovery times are strongly associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics,
with biodiversity and CO2 fertilization as secondary factors. Our analysis also
provides two key insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of drought recovery
time: first, that recovery is longest in the tropics and high northern latitudes 
(both vulnerable areas of Earth's climate system) and second, that drought
impacts (assessed using the area of ecosystems actively recovering and time to
recovery) have increased over the twentieth century. If droughts become more
frequent, as expected, the time between droughts may become shorter than drought 
recovery time, leading to permanently damaged ecosystems and widespread
degradation of the land carbon sink.

Sensors play an important part in many aspects of daily life such as infrared
sensors in home security systems, particle sensors for environmental monitoring
and motion sensors in mobile phones. High-quality optical microcavities are prime
candidates for sensing applications because of their ability to enhance
light-matter interactions in a very confined volume. Examples of such devices
include mechanical transducers, magnetometers, single-particle absorption
spectrometers, and microcavity sensors for sizing single particles and detecting 
nanometre-scale objects such as single nanoparticles and atomic ions.
Traditionally, a very small perturbation near an optical microcavity introduces
either a change in the linewidth or a frequency shift or splitting of a resonance
that is proportional to the strength of the perturbation. Here we demonstrate an 
alternative sensing scheme, by which the sensitivity of microcavities can be
enhanced when operated at non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies known as
exceptional points. In our experiments, we use two nanoscale scatterers to tune a
whispering-gallery-mode micro-toroid cavity, in which light propagates along a
concave surface by continuous total internal reflection, in a precise and
controlled manner to exceptional points. A target nanoscale object that
subsequently enters the evanescent field of the cavity perturbs the system from
its exceptional point, leading to frequency splitting. Owing to the
complex-square-root topology near an exceptional point, this frequency splitting 
scales as the square root of the perturbation strength and is therefore larger
(for sufficiently small perturbations) than the splitting observed in traditional
non-exceptional-point sensing schemes. Our demonstration of
exceptional-point-enhanced sensitivity paves the way for sensors with
unprecedented sensitivity.

Associating stimuli with positive or negative reinforcement is essential for
survival, but a complete wiring diagram of a higher-order circuit supporting
associative memory has not been previously available. Here we reconstruct one
such circuit at synaptic resolution, the Drosophila larval mushroom body. We find
that most Kenyon cells integrate random combinations of inputs but that a subset 
receives stereotyped inputs from single projection neurons. This organization
maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task.
We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with
previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron 
connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly
high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped
connections found between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned
behaviours. The complete circuit map of the mushroom body should guide future
functional studies of this learning and memory centre.

Non-Hermitian degeneracies, also known as exceptional points, have recently
emerged as a new way to engineer the response of open physical systems, that is, 
those that interact with the environment. They correspond to points in parameter 
space at which the eigenvalues of the underlying system and the corresponding
eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce. In optics, the abrupt nature of the phase
transitions that are encountered around exceptional points has been shown to lead
to many intriguing phenomena, such as loss-induced transparency, unidirectional
invisibility, band merging, topological chirality and laser mode selectivity.
Recently, it has been shown that the bifurcation properties of second-order
non-Hermitian degeneracies can provide a means of enhancing the sensitivity
(frequency shifts) of resonant optical structures to external perturbations. Of
particular interest is the use of even higher-order exceptional points (greater
than second order), which in principle could further amplify the effect of
perturbations, leading to even greater sensitivity. Although a growing number of 
theoretical studies have been devoted to such higher-order degeneracies, their
experimental demonstration in the optical domain has so far remained elusive.
Here we report the observation of higher-order exceptional points in a coupled
cavity arrangement-specifically, a ternary, parity-time-symmetric photonic laser 
molecule-with a carefully tailored gain-loss distribution. We study the system in
the spectral domain and find that the frequency response associated with this
system follows a cube-root dependence on induced perturbations in the refractive 
index. Our work paves the way for utilizing non-Hermitian degeneracies in fields 
including photonics, optomechanics, microwaves and atomic physics.

The evolutionary history of extant hominoids (humans and apes) remains poorly
understood. The African fossil record during the crucial time period, the Miocene
epoch, largely comprises isolated jaws and teeth, and little is known about ape
cranial evolution. Here we report on the, to our knowledge, most complete fossil 
ape cranium yet described, recovered from the 13 million-year-old Middle Miocene 
site of Napudet, Kenya. The infant specimen, KNM-NP 59050, is assigned to a new
species of Nyanzapithecus on the basis of its unerupted permanent teeth,
visualized by synchrotron imaging. Its ear canal has a fully ossified tubular
ectotympanic, a derived feature linking the species with crown catarrhines.
Although it resembles some hylobatids in aspects of its morphology and dental
development, it possesses no definitive hylobatid synapomorphies. The combined
evidence suggests that nyanzapithecines were stem hominoids close to the origin
of extant apes, and that hylobatid-like facial features evolved multiple times
during catarrhine evolution.

Hundreds of thousands of human genomes are now being sequenced to characterize
genetic variation and use this information to augment association mapping studies
of complex disorders and other phenotypic traits. Genetic variation is identified
mainly by mapping short reads to the reference genome or by performing local
assembly. However, these approaches are biased against discovery of structural
variants and variation in the more complex parts of the genome. Hence,
large-scale de novo assembly is needed. Here we show that it is possible to
construct excellent de novo assemblies from high-coverage sequencing with
mate-pair libraries extending up to 20 kilobases. We report de novo assemblies of
150 individuals (50 trios) from the GenomeDenmark project. The quality of these
assemblies is similar to those obtained using the more expensive long-read
technology. We use the assemblies to identify a rich set of structural variants
including many novel insertions and demonstrate how this variant catalogue
enables further deciphering of known association mapping signals. We leverage the
assemblies to provide 100 completely resolved major histocompatibility complex
haplotypes and to resolve major parts of the Y chromosome. Our study provides a
regional reference genome that we expect will improve the power of future
association mapping studies and hence pave the way for precision medicine
initiatives, which now are being launched in many countries including Denmark.

It has been proposed that the hypothalamus helps to control ageing, but the
mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here we develop several mouse models in
which hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that co-express Sox2 and Bmi1 are
ablated, as we observed that ageing in mice started with a substantial loss of
these hypothalamic cells. Each mouse model consistently displayed acceleration of
ageing-like physiological changes or a shortened lifespan. Conversely, ageing
retardation and lifespan extension were achieved in mid-aged mice that were
locally implanted with healthy hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells that had been
genetically engineered to survive in the ageing-related hypothalamic inflammatory
microenvironment. Mechanistically, hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells contributed
greatly to exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in the cerebrospinal fluid, and these
exosomal miRNAs declined during ageing, whereas central treatment with healthy
hypothalamic stem/progenitor cell-secreted exosomes led to the slowing of ageing.
In conclusion, ageing speed is substantially controlled by hypothalamic stem
cells, partially through the release of exosomal miRNAs.

During multicellular development, specification of distinct cell fates is often
regulated by the same transcription factors operating differently in distinct
cis-regulatory modules, either through different protein complexes,
conformational modification of protein complexes, or combinations of both. Direct
visualization of different transcription factor complex states guiding specific
gene expression programs has been challenging. Here we use in vivo FRET-FLIM
(Förster resonance energy transfer measured by fluorescence lifetime microscopy) 
to reveal spatial partitioning of protein interactions in relation to
specification of cell fate. We show that, in Arabidopsis roots, three fully
functional fluorescently tagged cell fate regulators establish cell-type-specific
interactions at endogenous expression levels and can form higher order complexes.
We reveal that cell-type-specific in vivo FRET-FLIM distributions reflect
conformational changes of these complexes to differentially regulate target genes
and specify distinct cell fates.

Many retinal diseases lead to the loss of retinal neurons and cause visual
impairment. The adult mammalian retina has little capacity for regeneration. By
contrast, teleost fish functionally regenerate their retina following injury, and
Müller glia (MG) are the source of regenerated neurons. The proneural
transcription factor Ascl1 is upregulated in MG after retinal damage in zebrafish
and is necessary for regeneration. Although Ascl1 is not expressed in mammalian
MG after injury, forced expression of Ascl1 in mouse MG induces a neurogenic
state in vitro and in vivo after NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) damage in young
mice. However, by postnatal day 16, mouse MG lose neurogenic capacity, despite
Ascl1 overexpression. Loss of neurogenic capacity in mature MG is accompanied by 
reduced chromatin accessibility, suggesting that epigenetic factors limit
regeneration. Here we show that MG-specific overexpression of Ascl1, together
with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, enables adult mice to generate neurons from
MG after retinal injury. The MG-derived neurons express markers of inner retinal 
neurons, synapse with host retinal neurons, and respond to light. Using an assay 
for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), 
we show that the histone deacetylase inhibitor promotes accessibility at key gene
loci in the MG, and allows more effective reprogramming. Our results thus provide
a new approach for the treatment of blinding retinal diseases.

Synthetic biology aims to develop engineering-driven approaches to the
programming of cellular functions that could yield transformative technologies.
Synthetic gene circuits that combine DNA, protein, and RNA components have
demonstrated a range of functions such as bistability, oscillation, feedback, and
logic capabilities. However, it remains challenging to scale up these circuits
owing to the limited number of designable, orthogonal, high-performance parts,
the empirical and often tedious composition rules, and the requirements for
substantial resources for encoding and operation. Here, we report a strategy for 
constructing RNA-only nanodevices to evaluate complex logic in living cells. Our 
'ribocomputing' systems are composed of de-novo-designed parts and operate
through predictable and designable base-pairing rules, allowing the effective in 
silico design of computing devices with prescribed configurations and functions
in complex cellular environments. These devices operate at the
post-transcriptional level and use an extended RNA transcript to co-localize all 
circuit sensing, computation, signal transduction, and output elements in the
same self-assembled molecular complex, which reduces diffusion-mediated signal
losses, lowers metabolic cost, and improves circuit reliability. We demonstrate
that ribocomputing devices in Escherichia coli can evaluate two-input logic with 
a dynamic range up to 900-fold and scale them to four-input AND, six-input OR,
and a complex 12-input expression (A1 AND A2 AND NOT A1*) OR (B1 AND B2 AND NOT
B2*) OR (C1 AND C2) OR (D1 AND D2) OR (E1 AND E2). Successful operation of
ribocomputing devices based on programmable RNA interactions suggests that
systems employing the same design principles could be implemented in other host
organisms or in extracellular settings.

Metasedimentary rocks from Isua, West Greenland (over 3,700 million years old)
contain 13C-depleted carbonaceous compounds, with isotopic ratios that are
compatible with a biogenic origin. Metamorphic garnet crystals in these rocks
contain trails of carbonaceous inclusions that are contiguous with carbon-rich
sedimentary beds in the host rock, where carbon is fully graphitized. Previous
studies have not been able to document other elements of life (mainly hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus) structurally bound to this carbonaceous
material. Here we study carbonaceous inclusions armoured within garnet
porphyroblasts, by in situ infrared absorption on approximately 10-21 m3 domains 
within these inclusions. We show that the absorption spectra are consistent with 
carbon bonded to nitrogen and oxygen, and probably also to phosphate. The levels 
of C-H or O-H bonds were found to be low. These results are consistent with
biogenic organic material isolated for billions of years and thermally matured at
temperatures of around 500 °C. They therefore provide spatial characterization
for potentially the oldest biogenic carbon relics in Earth's geological record.
The preservation of Eoarchean organic residues within sedimentary material
corroborates earlier claims for the biogenic origins of carbon in Isua
metasediments.

No immunogen to date has reliably elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV
in humans or animal models. Advances in the design of immunogens that
antigenically mimic the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env), such as the soluble
cleaved trimer BG505 SOSIP, have improved the elicitation of potent
isolate-specific antibody responses in rabbits and macaques, but so far failed to
induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. One possible reason for this failure is
that the relevant antibody repertoires are poorly suited to target the conserved 
epitope regions on Env, which are somewhat occluded relative to the exposed
variable epitopes. Here, to test this hypothesis, we immunized four cows with
BG505 SOSIP. The antibody repertoire of cows contains long third heavy chain
complementary determining regions (HCDR3) with an ultralong subset that can reach
more than 70 amino acids in length. Remarkably, BG505 SOSIP immunization resulted
in rapid elicitation of broad and potent serum antibody responses in all four
cows. Longitudinal serum analysis for one cow showed the development of
neutralization breadth (20%, n = 117 cross-clade isolates) in 42 days and 96%
breadth (n = 117) at 381 days. A monoclonal antibody isolated from this cow
harboured an ultralong HCDR3 of 60 amino acids and neutralized 72% of cross-clade
isolates (n = 117) with a potent median IC50 of 0.028 μg ml-1. Breadth was
elicited with a single trimer immunogen and did not require additional envelope
diversity. Immunization of cows may provide an avenue to rapidly generate
antibody prophylactics and therapeutics to address disease agents that have
evolved to avoid human antibody responses.

The major energy source for most cells is glucose, from which ATP is generated
via glycolysis and/or oxidative metabolism. Glucose deprivation activates
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), but it is unclear whether this activation
occurs solely via changes in AMP or ADP, the classical activators of AMPK. Here, 
we describe an AMP/ADP-independent mechanism that triggers AMPK activation by
sensing the absence of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), with AMPK being
progressively activated as extracellular glucose and intracellular FBP decrease. 
When unoccupied by FBP, aldolases promote the formation of a lysosomal complex
containing at least v-ATPase, ragulator, axin, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and AMPK,
which has previously been shown to be required for AMPK activation. Knockdown of 
aldolases activates AMPK even in cells with abundant glucose, whereas the
catalysis-defective D34S aldolase mutant, which still binds FBP, blocks AMPK
activation. Cell-free reconstitution assays show that addition of FBP disrupts
the association of axin and LKB1 with v-ATPase and ragulator. Importantly, in
some cell types AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP ratios remain unchanged during acute glucose 
starvation, and intact AMP-binding sites on AMPK are not required for AMPK
activation. These results establish that aldolase, as well as being a glycolytic 
enzyme, is a sensor of glucose availability that regulates AMPK.

Converting CO2 into fuel or chemical feedstock compounds could in principle
reduce fossil fuel consumption and climate-changing CO2 emissions. One strategy
aims for electrochemical conversions powered by electricity from renewable
sources, but photochemical approaches driven by sunlight are also conceivable. A 
considerable challenge in both approaches is the development of efficient and
selective catalysts, ideally based on cheap and Earth-abundant elements rather
than expensive precious metals. Of the molecular photo- and electrocatalysts
reported, only a few catalysts are stable and selective for CO2 reduction;
moreover, these catalysts produce primarily CO or HCOOH, and catalysts capable of
generating even low to moderate yields of highly reduced hydrocarbons remain
rare. Here we show that an iron tetraphenylporphyrin complex functionalized with 
trimethylammonio groups, which is the most efficient and selective molecular
electro- catalyst for converting CO2 to CO known, can also catalyse the
eight-electron reduction of CO2 to methane upon visible light irradiation at
ambient temperature and pressure. We find that the catalytic system, operated in 
an acetonitrile solution containing a photosensitizer and sacrificial electron
donor, operates stably over several days. CO is the main product of the direct
CO2 photoreduction reaction, but a two-pot procedure that first reduces CO2 and
then reduces CO generates methane with a selectivity of up to 82 per cent and a
quantum yield (light-to-product efficiency) of 0.18 per cent. However, we
anticipate that the operating principles of our system may aid the development of
other molecular catalysts for the production of solar fuels from CO2 under mild
conditions.

The cortex represents information across widely varying timescales. For instance,
sensory cortex encodes stimuli that fluctuate over few tens of milliseconds,
whereas in association cortex behavioural choices can require the maintenance of 
information over seconds. However, it remains poorly understood whether diverse
timescales result mostly from features intrinsic to individual neurons or from
neuronal population activity. This question remains unanswered, because the
timescales of coding in populations of neurons have not been studied extensively,
and population codes have not been compared systematically across cortical
regions. Here we show that population codes can be essential to achieve long
coding timescales. Furthermore, we find that the properties of population codes
differ between sensory and association cortices. We compared coding for sensory
stimuli and behavioural choices in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex 
as mice performed a sound localization task. Auditory stimulus information was
stronger in auditory cortex than in posterior parietal cortex, and both regions
contained choice information. Although auditory cortex and posterior parietal
cortex coded information by tiling in time neurons that were transiently
informative for approximately 200 milliseconds, the areas had major differences
in functional coupling between neurons, measured as activity correlations that
could not be explained by task events. Coupling among posterior parietal cortex
neurons was strong and extended over long time lags, whereas coupling among
auditory cortex neurons was weak and short-lived. Stronger coupling in posterior 
parietal cortex led to a population code with long timescales and a
representation of choice that remained consistent for approximately 1 second. In 
contrast, auditory cortex had a code with rapid fluctuations in stimulus and
choice information over hundreds of milliseconds. Our results reveal that
population codes differ across cortex and that coupling is a variable property of
cortical populations that affects the timescale of information coding and the
accuracy of behaviour.

Interacting fermions on a lattice can develop strong quantum correlations, which 
are the cause of the classical intractability of many exotic phases of matter.
Current efforts are directed towards the control of artificial quantum systems
that can be made to emulate the underlying Fermi-Hubbard models.
Electrostatically confined conduction-band electrons define interacting quantum
coherent spin and charge degrees of freedom that allow all-electrical
initialization of low-entropy states and readily adhere to the Fermi-Hubbard
Hamiltonian. Until now, however, the substantial electrostatic disorder of the
solid state has meant that only a few attempts at emulating Fermi-Hubbard physics
on solid-state platforms have been made. Here we show that for gate-defined
quantum dots this disorder can be suppressed in a controlled manner. Using a
semi-automated and scalable set of experimental tools, we homogeneously and
independently set up the electron filling and nearest-neighbour tunnel coupling
in a semiconductor quantum dot array so as to simulate a Fermi-Hubbard system.
With this set-up, we realize a detailed characterization of the collective
Coulomb blockade transition, which is the finite-size analogue of the
interaction-driven Mott metal-to-insulator transition. As automation and device
fabrication of semiconductor quantum dots continue to improve, the ideas
presented here will enable the investigation of the physics of ever more complex 
many-body states using quantum dots.

Infrared radiation emitted from a planet contains information about the chemical 
composition and vertical temperature profile of its atmosphere. If upper layers
are cooler than lower layers, molecular gases will produce absorption features in
the planetary thermal spectrum. Conversely, if there is a stratosphere-where
temperature increases with altitude-these molecular features will be observed in 
emission. It has been suggested that stratospheres could form in highly
irradiated exoplanets, but the extent to which this occurs is unresolved both
theoretically and observationally. A previous claim for the presence of a
stratosphere remains open to question, owing to the challenges posed by the
highly variable host star and the low spectral resolution of the measurements.
Here we report a near-infrared thermal spectrum for the ultrahot gas giant
WASP-121b, which has an equilibrium temperature of approximately 2,500 kelvin.
Water is resolved in emission, providing a detection of an exoplanet stratosphere
at 5σ confidence. These observations imply that a substantial fraction of
incident stellar radiation is retained at high altitudes in the atmosphere,
possibly by absorbing chemical species such as gaseous vanadium oxide and
titanium oxide.

Anthrax is a globally important animal disease and zoonosis. Despite this, our
current knowledge of anthrax ecology is largely limited to arid ecosystems, where
outbreaks are most commonly reported. Here we show that the dynamics of an
anthrax-causing agent, Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis, in a tropical rainforest
have severe consequences for local wildlife communities. Using data and samples
collected over three decades, we show that rainforest anthrax is a persistent and
widespread cause of death for a broad range of mammalian hosts. We predict that
this pathogen will accelerate the decline and possibly result in the extirpation 
of local chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) populations. We present the
epidemiology of a cryptic pathogen and show that its presence has important
implications for conservation.

The extreme energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic collisions between
heavy atomic nuclei produce a state of matter that behaves surprisingly like a
fluid, with exceptionally high temperature and low viscosity. Non-central
collisions have angular momenta of the order of 1,000ћ, and the resulting fluid
may have a strong vortical structure that must be understood to describe the
fluid properly. The vortical structure is also of particular interest because the
restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum chromodynamics is expected to
produce novel physical effects in the presence of strong vorticity. However, no
experimental indications of fluid vorticity in heavy ion collisions have yet been
found. Since vorticity represents a local rotational structure of the fluid,
spin-orbit coupling can lead to preferential orientation of particle spins along 
the direction of rotation. Here we present measurements of an alignment between
the global angular momentum of a non-central collision and the spin of emitted
particles (in this case the collision occurs between gold nuclei and produces Λ
baryons), revealing that the fluid produced in heavy ion collisions is the most
vortical system so far observed. (At high energies, this fluid is a quark-gluon
plasma.) We find that Λ and hyperons show a positive polarization of the order of
a few per cent, consistent with some hydrodynamic predictions. (A hyperon is a
particle composed of three quarks, at least one of which is a strange quark; the 
remainder are up and down quarks, found in protons and neutrons.) A previous
measurement that reported a null result, that is, zero polarization, at higher
collision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our observations,
though with larger statistical uncertainties. These data provide experimental
access to the vortical structure of the nearly ideal liquid created in a heavy
ion collision and should prove valuable in the development of hydrodynamic models
that quantitatively connect observations to the theory of the strong force.

The observation of hyperfine structure in atomic hydrogen by Rabi and co-workers 
and the measurement of the zero-field ground-state splitting at the level of
seven parts in 1013 are important achievements of mid-twentieth-century physics. 
The work that led to these achievements also provided the first evidence for the 
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, inspired Schwinger's relativistic
theory of quantum electrodynamics and gave rise to the hydrogen maser, which is a
critical component of modern navigation, geo-positioning and very-long-baseline
interferometry systems. Research at the Antiproton Decelerator at CERN by the
ALPHA collaboration extends these enquiries into the antimatter sector. Recently,
tools have been developed that enable studies of the hyperfine structure of
antihydrogen-the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen. The goal of such studies is 
to search for any differences that might exist between this archetypal pair of
atoms, and thereby to test the fundamental principles on which quantum field
theory is constructed. Magnetic trapping of antihydrogen atoms provides a means
of studying them by combining electromagnetic interaction with detection
techniques that are unique to antimatter. Here we report the results of a
microwave spectroscopy experiment in which we probe the response of antihydrogen 
over a controlled range of frequencies. The data reveal clear and distinct
signatures of two allowed transitions, from which we obtain a direct,
magnetic-field-independent measurement of the hyperfine splitting. From a set of 
trials involving 194 detected atoms, we determine a splitting of 1,420.4 ± 0.5
megahertz, consistent with expectations for atomic hydrogen at the level of four 
parts in 104. This observation of the detailed behaviour of a quantum transition 
in an atom of antihydrogen exemplifies tests of fundamental symmetries such as
charge-parity-time in antimatter, and the techniques developed here will enable
more-precise such tests.

The human body carries vast communities of microbes that provide many benefits.
Our microbiome is complex and challenging to understand, but evolutionary theory 
provides a universal framework with which to analyse its biology and health
impacts. Here we argue that to understand a given microbiome feature, such as
colonization resistance, host nutrition or immune development, we must consider
how hosts and symbionts evolve. Symbionts commonly evolve to compete within the
host ecosystem, while hosts evolve to keep the ecosystem on a leash. We suggest
that the health benefits of the microbiome should be understood, and studied, as 
an interplay between microbial competition and host control.

Mammalian sperm and oocytes have different epigenetic landscapes and are
organized in different fashions. After fertilization, the initially distinct
parental epigenomes become largely equalized with the exception of certain loci, 
including imprinting control regions. How parental chromatin becomes equalized
and how imprinting control regions escape from this reprogramming is largely
unknown. Here we profile parental allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites in
mouse zygotes and morula embryos, and investigate the epigenetic mechanisms
underlying these allelic sites. Integrated analyses of DNA methylome and
tri-methylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing identify 76 genes with paternal
allele-specific DNase I hypersensitive sites that are devoid of DNA methylation
but harbour maternal allele-specific H3K27me3. Interestingly, these genes are
paternally expressed in preimplantation embryos, and ectopic removal of H3K27me3 
induces maternal allele expression. H3K27me3-dependent imprinting is largely lost
in the embryonic cell lineage, but at least five genes maintain their imprinted
expression in the extra-embryonic cell lineage. The five genes include all
paternally expressed autosomal imprinted genes previously demonstrated to be
independent of oocyte DNA methylation. Thus, our study identifies maternal
H3K27me3 as a DNA methylation-independent imprinting mechanism.

The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) refers to a unique process in which
factors released by irradiated cells or tissues exert effects on other parts of
the animal not exposed to radiation, causing genomic instability, stress
responses and altered apoptosis or cell proliferation. Although RIBEs have
important implications for radioprotection, radiation safety and radiotherapy,
the molecular identities of RIBE factors and their mechanisms of action remain
poorly understood. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans as a model in which to
study RIBEs, and identify the cysteine protease CPR-4, a homologue of human
cathepsin B, as the first RIBE factor in nematodes, to our knowledge. CPR-4 is
secreted from animals irradiated with ultraviolet or ionizing gamma rays, and is 
the major factor in the conditioned medium that leads to the inhibition of cell
death and increased embryonic lethality in unirradiated animals. Moreover, CPR-4 
causes these effects and stress responses at unexposed sites distal to the
irradiated tissue. The activity of CPR-4 is regulated by the p53 homologue CEP-1 
in response to radiation, and CPR-4 seems to exert RIBEs by acting through the
insulin-like growth factor receptor DAF-2. Our study provides crucial insights
into RIBEs, and will facilitate the identification of additional RIBE factors and
their mechanisms of action.

Immunotherapy with PD-1 checkpoint blockade is effective in only a minority of
patients with cancer, suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed.
Here we use a pooled in vivo genetic screening approach using CRISPR-Cas9 genome 
editing in transplantable tumours in mice treated with immunotherapy to discover 
previously undescribed immunotherapy targets. We tested 2,368 genes expressed by 
melanoma cells to identify those that synergize with or cause resistance to
checkpoint blockade. We recovered the known immune evasion molecules PD-L1 and
CD47, and confirmed that defects in interferon-γ signalling caused resistance to 
immunotherapy. Tumours were sensitized to immunotherapy by deletion of genes
involved in several diverse pathways, including NF-κB signalling, antigen
presentation and the unfolded protein response. In addition, deletion of the
protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN2 in tumour cells increased the efficacy of
immunotherapy by enhancing interferon-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation 
and growth suppression. In vivo genetic screens in tumour models can identify new
immunotherapy targets in unanticipated pathways.

Global biodiversity loss is a critical environmental crisis, yet the lack of
spatial data on biodiversity threats has hindered conservation strategies. Theory
predicts that abrupt biodiversity declines are most likely to occur when habitat 
availability is reduced to very low levels in the landscape (10-30%).
Alternatively, recent evidence indicates that biodiversity is best conserved by
minimizing human intrusion into intact and relatively unfragmented landscapes.
Here we use recently available forest loss data to test deforestation effects on 
International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categories of extinction 
risk for 19,432 vertebrate species worldwide. As expected, deforestation
substantially increased the odds of a species being listed as threatened,
undergoing recent upgrading to a higher threat category and exhibiting declining 
populations. More importantly, we show that these risks were disproportionately
high in relatively intact landscapes; even minimal deforestation has had severe
consequences for vertebrate biodiversity. We found little support for the
alternative hypothesis that forest loss is most detrimental in already fragmented
landscapes. Spatial analysis revealed high-risk hot spots in Borneo, the central 
Amazon and the Congo Basin. In these regions, our model predicts that 121-219
species will become threatened under current rates of forest loss over the next
30 years. Given that only 17.9% of these high-risk areas are formally protected
and only 8.9% have strict protection, new large-scale conservation efforts to
protect intact forests are necessary to slow deforestation rates and to avert a
new wave of global extinctions.

TMEM175 is a lysosomal K+ channel that is important for maintaining the membrane 
potential and pH stability in lysosomes. It contains two homologous copies of a
six-transmembrane-helix (6-TM) domain, which has no sequence homology to the
canonical tetrameric K+ channels and lacks the TVGYG selectivity filter motif
found in these channels. The prokaryotic TMEM175 channel, which is present in a
subset of bacteria and archaea, contains only a single 6-TM domain and functions 
as a tetramer. Here, we present the crystal structure of a prokaryotic TMEM175
channel from Chamaesiphon minutus, CmTMEM175, the architecture of which
represents a completely different fold from that of canonical K+ channels. All
six transmembrane helices of CmTMEM175 are tightly packed within each subunit
without undergoing domain swapping. The highly conserved TM1 helix acts as the
pore-lining inner helix, creating an hourglass-shaped ion permeation pathway in
the channel tetramer. Three layers of hydrophobic residues on the
carboxy-terminal half of the TM1 helices form a bottleneck along the ion
conduction pathway and serve as the selectivity filter of the channel.
Mutagenesis analysis suggests that the first layer of the highly conserved
isoleucine residues in the filter is primarily responsible for channel
selectivity. Thus, the structure of CmTMEM175 represents a novel architecture of 
a tetrameric cation channel whose ion selectivity mechanism appears to be
distinct from that of the classical K+ channel family.

When flying or swimming, animals must adjust their own movement to compensate for
displacements induced by the flow of the surrounding air or water. These
flow-induced displacements can most easily be detected as visual whole-field
motion with respect to the animal's frame of reference. Despite this, many
aquatic animals consistently orient and swim against oncoming flows (a behaviour 
known as rheotaxis) even in the absence of visual cues. How animals achieve this 
task, and its underlying sensory basis, is still unknown. Here we show that, in
the absence of visual information, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) perform
rheotaxis by using flow velocity gradients as navigational cues. We present
behavioural data that support a novel algorithm based on such local velocity
gradients that fish use to avoid getting dragged by flowing water. Specifically, 
we show that fish use their mechanosensory lateral line to first sense the curl
(or vorticity) of the local velocity vector field to detect the presence of flow 
and, second, to measure its temporal change after swim bouts to deduce flow
direction. These results reveal an elegant navigational strategy based on the
sensing of flow velocity gradients and provide a comprehensive behavioural
algorithm, also applicable for robotic design, that generalizes to a wide range
of animal behaviours in moving fluids.

How a sensory stimulus is processed and perceived depends on the surrounding
sensory scene. In the visual cortex, contextual signals can be conveyed by an
extensive network of intra- and inter-areal excitatory connections that link
neurons representing stimulus features separated in visual space. However, the
connectional logic of visual contextual inputs remains unknown; it is not clear
what information individual neurons receive from different parts of the visual
field, nor how this input relates to the visual features that a neuron encodes,
defined by its spatial receptive field. Here we determine the organization of
excitatory synaptic inputs responding to different locations in the visual scene 
by mapping spatial receptive fields in dendritic spines of mouse visual cortex
neurons using two-photon calcium imaging. We find that neurons receive
functionally diverse inputs from extended regions of visual space. Inputs
representing similar visual features from the same location in visual space are
more likely to cluster on neighbouring spines. Inputs from visual field regions
beyond the receptive field of the postsynaptic neuron often synapse on
higher-order dendritic branches. These putative long-range inputs are more
frequent and more likely to share the preference for oriented edges with the
postsynaptic neuron when the receptive field of the input is spatially displaced 
along the axis of the receptive field orientation of the postsynaptic neuron.
Therefore, the connectivity between neurons with displaced receptive fields obeys
a specific rule, whereby they connect preferentially when their receptive fields 
are co-oriented and co-axially aligned. This organization of synaptic
connectivity is ideally suited for the amplification of elongated edges, which
are enriched in the visual environment, and thus provides a potential substrate
for contour integration and object grouping.

Heterochromatic DNA domains have important roles in the regulation of gene
expression and maintenance of genome stability by silencing repetitive DNA
elements and transposons. From fission yeast to mammals, heterochromatin assembly
at DNA repeats involves the activity of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) associated
with the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Typically, sRNAs, originating from long
noncoding RNAs, guide Argonaute-containing effector complexes to complementary
nascent RNAs to initiate histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2 and 
H3K9me3, respectively) and the formation of heterochromatin. H3K9me is in turn
required for the recruitment of RNAi to chromatin to promote the amplification of
sRNA. Yet, how heterochromatin formation, which silences transcription, can
proceed by a co-transcriptional mechanism that also promotes sRNA generation
remains paradoxical. Here, using Clr4, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe homologue of mammalian SUV39H H3K9 methyltransferases, we design
active-site mutations that block H3K9me3, but allow H3K9me2 catalysis. We show
that H3K9me2 defines a functionally distinct heterochromatin state that is
sufficient for RNAi-dependent co-transcriptional gene silencing at
pericentromeric DNA repeats. Unlike H3K9me3 domains, which are transcriptionally 
silent, H3K9me2 domains are transcriptionally active, contain modifications
associated with euchromatic transcription, and couple RNAi-mediated transcript
degradation to the establishment of H3K9me domains. The two H3K9me states recruit
reader proteins with different efficiencies, explaining their different
downstream silencing functions. Furthermore, the transition from H3K9me2 to
H3K9me3 is required for RNAi-independent epigenetic inheritance of H3K9me
domains. Our findings demonstrate that H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 define functionally
distinct chromatin states and uncover a mechanism for the formation of
transcriptionally permissive heterochromatin that is compatible with its broadly 
conserved role in sRNA-mediated genome defence.

Plasticity of the cell state has been proposed to drive resistance to multiple
classes of cancer therapies, thereby limiting their effectiveness. A
high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has
been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse
cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained
incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant 
high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show
that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against
ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic 
lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of
enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are
the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid
metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid
glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates
lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides
that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across 
diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1,
including epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas,
TGFβ-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine
transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a
mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin. We identify vulnerability to
ferroptic cell death induced by inhibition of a lipid peroxidase pathway as a
feature of therapy-resistant cancer cells across diverse mesenchymal cell-state
contexts.

The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the principal target of the psychoactive
constituent of marijuana, the partial agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC).
Here we report two agonist-bound crystal structures of human CB1 in complex with 
a tetrahydrocannabinol (AM11542) and a hexahydrocannabinol (AM841) at 2.80 Å and 
2.95 Å resolution, respectively. The two CB1-agonist complexes reveal important
conformational changes in the overall structure, relative to the antagonist-bound
state, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and
an increase in the surface area of the G-protein-binding region. In addition, a
'twin toggle switch' of Phe2003.36 and Trp3566.48 (superscripts denote
Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering) is experimentally observed and appears to be
essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into 
the activation mechanism of CB1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the 
binding modes of Δ9-THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The
plasticity of the binding pocket of CB1 seems to be a common feature among
certain class A G-protein-coupled receptors. These findings should inspire the
design of chemically diverse ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.

Small-molecule, biologically active natural products continue to be our most
rewarding source of, and inspiration for, new medicines. Sometimes we happen upon
such molecules in minute quantities in unique, difficult-to-reach, and often
fleeting environments, perhaps never to be discovered again. In these cases,
determining the structure of a molecule-including assigning its relative and
absolute configurations-is paramount, enabling one to understand its biological
activity. Molecules that comprise stereochemically complex acyclic and
conformationally flexible carbon chains make such a task extremely challenging.
The baulamycins (A and B) serve as a contemporary example. Isolated in small
quantities and shown to have promising antimicrobial activity, the structure of
the conformationally flexible molecules was determined largely through J-based
configurational analysis, but has been found to be incorrect. Our subsequent
campaign to identify the true structures of the baulamycins has revealed a
powerful method for the rapid structural elucidation of such molecules.
Specifically, the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters
through density functional theory-combined with an efficient sequence of
boron-based synthetic transformations, which allowed an encoded (labelled)
mixture of natural-product diastereomers to be prepared-enabled us rapidly to
pinpoint and synthesize the correct structures.

The origin of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides and the nature 
of the 'normal' state above the critical temperature are widely debated. In
underdoped copper oxides, this normal state hosts a pseudogap and other anomalous
features; and in the overdoped materials, the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer 
description fails, challenging the idea that the normal state is a simple Fermi
liquid. To investigate these questions, we have studied the behaviour of
single-crystal La2-xSrxCuO4 films through which an electrical current is being
passed. Here we report that a spontaneous voltage develops across the sample,
transverse (orthogonal) to the electrical current. The dependence of this voltage
on probe current, temperature, in-plane device orientation and doping shows that 
this behaviour is intrinsic, substantial, robust and present over a broad range
of temperature and doping. If the current direction is rotated in-plane by an
angle ϕ, the transverse voltage oscillates as sin(2ϕ), breaking the four-fold
rotational symmetry of the crystal. The amplitude of the oscillations is strongly
peaked near the critical temperature for superconductivity and decreases with
increasing doping. We find that these phenomena are manifestations of unexpected 
in-plane anisotropy in the electronic transport. The films are very thin and
epitaxially constrained to be tetragonal (that is, with four-fold symmetry), so
one expects a constant resistivity and zero transverse voltage, for every ϕ. The 
origin of this anisotropy is purely electronic-the so-called electronic
nematicity. Unusually, the nematic director is not aligned with the crystal axes,
unless a substantial orthorhombic distortion is imposed. The fact that this
anisotropy occurs in a material that exhibits high-temperature superconductivity 
may not be a coincidence.

Neurons in the brain behave as nonlinear oscillators, which develop rhythmic
activity and interact to process information. Taking inspiration from this
behaviour to realize high-density, low-power neuromorphic computing will require 
very large numbers of nanoscale nonlinear oscillators. A simple estimation
indicates that to fit 108 oscillators organized in a two-dimensional array inside
a chip the size of a thumb, the lateral dimension of each oscillator must be
smaller than one micrometre. However, nanoscale devices tend to be noisy and to
lack the stability that is required to process data in a reliable way. For this
reason, despite multiple theoretical proposals and several candidates, including 
memristive and superconducting oscillators, a proof of concept of neuromorphic
computing using nanoscale oscillators has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show
experimentally that a nanoscale spintronic oscillator (a magnetic tunnel
junction) can be used to achieve spoken-digit recognition with an accuracy
similar to that of state-of-the-art neural networks. We also determine the regime
of magnetization dynamics that leads to the greatest performance. These results, 
combined with the ability of the spintronic oscillators to interact with each
other, and their long lifetime and low energy consumption, open up a path to
fast, parallel, on-chip computation based on networks of oscillators.

Newly formed black holes of stellar mass launch collimated outflows (jets) of
ionized matter that approach the speed of light. These outflows power prompt,
brief and intense flashes of γ-rays known as γ-ray bursts (GRBs), followed by
longer-lived afterglow radiation that is detected across the electromagnetic
spectrum. Measuring the polarization of the observed GRB radiation provides a
direct probe of the magnetic fields in the collimated jets. Rapid-response
polarimetric observations of newly discovered bursts have probed the initial
afterglow phase, and show that, minutes after the prompt emission has ended, the 
degree of linear polarization can be as high as 30 per cent-consistent with the
idea that a stable, globally ordered magnetic field permeates the jet at large
distances from the central source. By contrast, optical and γ-ray observations
during the prompt phase have led to discordant and often controversial results,
and no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the origin of the
prompt radiation or the configuration of the magnetic field. Here we report the
detection of substantial (8.3 ± 0.8 per cent from our most conservative
simulation), variable linear polarization of a prompt optical flash that
accompanied the extremely energetic and long-lived prompt γ-ray emission from GRB
160625B. Our measurements probe the structure of the magnetic field at an early
stage of the jet, closer to its central black hole, and show that the prompt
phase is produced via fast-cooling synchrotron radiation in a large-scale
magnetic field that is advected from the black hole and distorted by dissipation 
processes within the jet.

Long before infants reach, crawl or walk, they explore the world by looking: they
look to learn and to engage, giving preferential attention to social stimuli,
including faces, face-like stimuli and biological motion. This capacity-social
visual engagement-shapes typical infant development from birth and is
pathognomonically impaired in children affected by autism. Here we show that
variation in viewing of social scenes, including levels of preferential attention
and the timing, direction and targeting of individual eye movements, is strongly 
influenced by genetic factors, with effects directly traceable to the active
seeking of social information. In a series of eye-tracking experiments conducted 
with 338 toddlers, including 166 epidemiologically ascertained twins (enrolled by
representative sampling from the general population), 88 non-twins with autism
and 84 singleton controls, we find high monozygotic twin-twin concordance (0.91) 
and relatively low dizygotic concordance (0.35). Moreover, the characteristics
that are the most highly heritable, preferential attention to eye and mouth
regions of the face, are also those that are differentially decreased in children
with autism (χ2 = 64.03, P < 0.0001). These results implicate social visual
engagement as a neurodevelopmental endophenotype not only for autism, but also
for population-wide variation in social-information seeking. In addition, these
results reveal a means of human biological niche construction, with phenotypic
differences emerging from the interaction of individual genotypes with early life
experience.

Protective high-affinity antibody responses depend on competitive selection of B 
cells carrying somatically mutated B-cell receptors by follicular helper T (TFH) 
cells in germinal centres. The rapid T-B-cell interactions that occur during this
process are reminiscent of neural synaptic transmission pathways. Here we show
that a proportion of human TFH cells contain dense-core granules marked by
chromogranin B, which are normally found in neuronal presynaptic terminals
storing catecholamines such as dopamine. TFH cells produce high amounts of
dopamine and release it upon cognate interaction with B cells. Dopamine causes
rapid translocation of intracellular ICOSL (inducible T-cell co-stimulator
ligand, also known as ICOSLG) to the B-cell surface, which enhances accumulation 
of CD40L and chromogranin B granules at the human TFH cell synapse and increases 
the synapse area. Mathematical modelling suggests that faster dopamine-induced
T-B-cell interactions increase total germinal centre output and accelerate it by 
days. Delivery of neurotransmitters across the T-B-cell synapse may be
advantageous in the face of infection.

After liver injury, regeneration occurs through self-replication of hepatocytes. 
In severe liver injury, hepatocyte proliferation is impaired-a feature of human
chronic liver disease. It is unclear whether other liver cell types can
regenerate hepatocytes. Here we use two independent systems to impair hepatocyte 
proliferation during liver injury to evaluate the contribution of non-hepatocytes
to parenchymal regeneration. First, loss of β1-integrin in hepatocytes with liver
injury triggered a ductular reaction of cholangiocyte origin, with approximately 
25% of hepatocytes being derived from a non-hepatocyte origin. Second,
cholangiocytes were lineage traced with concurrent inhibition of hepatocyte
proliferation by β1-integrin knockdown or p21 overexpression, resulting in the
significant emergence of cholangiocyte-derived hepatocytes. We describe a model
of combined liver injury and inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation that causes
physiologically significant levels of regeneration of functional hepatocytes from
biliary cells.

DNA is an excellent medium for archiving data. Recent efforts have illustrated
the potential for information storage in DNA using synthesized oligonucleotides
assembled in vitro. A relatively unexplored avenue of information storage in DNA 
is the ability to write information into the genome of a living cell by the
addition of nucleotides over time. Using the Cas1-Cas2 integrase, the CRISPR-Cas 
microbial immune system stores the nucleotide content of invading viruses to
confer adaptive immunity. When harnessed, this system has the potential to write 
arbitrary information into the genome. Here we use the CRISPR-Cas system to
encode the pixel values of black and white images and a short movie into the
genomes of a population of living bacteria. In doing so, we push the technical
limits of this information storage system and optimize strategies to minimize
those limitations. We also uncover underlying principles of the CRISPR-Cas
adaptation system, including sequence determinants of spacer acquisition that are
relevant for understanding both the basic biology of bacterial adaptation and its
technological applications. This work demonstrates that this system can capture
and stably store practical amounts of real data within the genomes of populations
of living cells.

For many enveloped viruses, binding to a receptor(s) on a host cell acts as the
first step in a series of events culminating in fusion with the host cell
membrane and transfer of genetic material for replication. The envelope
glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is responsible for receptor
binding and fusion. Although Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in five
variable regions (V1-V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that
contribute roughly half the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of 
receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral
fitness. Soluble SOSIP Env trimers are structural and antigenic mimics of the
pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env, and are targets of broadly neutralizing
antibodies. Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development. Here we
present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of subtype B B41
SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at 
resolutions of 3.7 Å and 3.6 Å, respectively. We compare these to cryo-electron
microscopy reconstructions of B41 SOSIP Env trimers with no ligand or in complex 
with either CD4 or the CD4-binding-site antibody PGV04 at 5.6 Å, 5.2 Å and 7.4 Å 
resolution, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description 
yet, to our knowledge, of the CD4-17b-induced intermediate and provide the
molecular basis of the receptor-binding-induced conformational change required
for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both CD4 and b12 induce large, previously
uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 subunits, and the
fusion peptide becomes buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures provide 
key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from
HIV-1 as well as new templates for inhibitor design.

Polymodal thermo- and mechanosensitive two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels
of the TREK subfamily generate 'leak' currents that regulate neuronal
excitability, respond to lipids, temperature and mechanical stretch, and
influence pain, temperature perception and anaesthetic responses. These dimeric
voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily members have a unique topology
comprising two pore-forming regions per subunit. In contrast to other potassium
channels, K2P channels use a selectivity filter 'C-type' gate as the principal
gating site. Despite recent advances, poor pharmacological profiles of K2P
channels limit mechanistic and biological studies. Here we describe a class of
small-molecule TREK activators that directly stimulate the C-type gate by acting 
as molecular wedges that restrict interdomain interface movement behind the
selectivity filter. Structures of K2P2.1 (also known as TREK-1) alone and with
two selective K2P2.1 (TREK-1) and K2P10.1 (TREK-2) activators-an
N-aryl-sulfonamide, ML335, and a thiophene-carboxamide, ML402-define a cryptic
binding pocket unlike other ion channel small-molecule binding sites and,
together with functional studies, identify a cation-π interaction that controls
selectivity. Together, our data reveal a druggable K2P site that stabilizes the
C-type gate 'leak mode' and provide direct evidence for K2P selectivity filter
gating.

To be able to curb the global pandemic of physical inactivity and the associated 
5.3 million deaths per year, we need to understand the basic principles that
govern physical activity. However, there is a lack of large-scale measurements of
physical activity patterns across free-living populations worldwide. Here we
leverage the wide usage of smartphones with built-in accelerometry to measure
physical activity at the global scale. We study a dataset consisting of 68
million days of physical activity for 717,527 people, giving us a window into
activity in 111 countries across the globe. We find inequality in how activity is
distributed within countries and that this inequality is a better predictor of
obesity prevalence in the population than average activity volume. Reduced
activity in females contributes to a large portion of the observed activity
inequality. Aspects of the built environment, such as the walkability of a city, 
are associated with a smaller gender gap in activity and lower activity
inequality. In more walkable cities, activity is greater throughout the day and
throughout the week, across age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) groups, with
the greatest increases in activity found for females. Our findings have
implications for global public health policy and urban planning and highlight the
role of activity inequality and the built environment in improving physical
activity and health.

Glioblastoma is a universally lethal cancer with a median survival time of
approximately 15 months. Despite substantial efforts to define druggable targets,
there are no therapeutic options that notably extend the lifespan of patients
with glioblastoma. While previous work has largely focused on in vitro cellular
models, here we demonstrate a more physiologically relevant approach to target
discovery in glioblastoma. We adapted pooled RNA interference (RNAi) screening
technology for use in orthotopic patient-derived xenograft models, creating a
high-throughput negative-selection screening platform in a functional in vivo
tumour microenvironment. Using this approach, we performed parallel in vivo and
in vitro screens and discovered that the chromatin and transcriptional regulators
needed for cell survival in vivo are non-overlapping with those required in
vitro. We identified transcription pause-release and elongation factors as one
set of in vivo-specific cancer dependencies, and determined that these factors
are necessary for enhancer-mediated transcriptional adaptations that enable cells
to survive the tumour microenvironment. Our lead hit, JMJD6, mediates the
upregulation of in vivo stress and stimulus response pathways through
enhancer-mediated transcriptional pause-release, promoting cell survival
specifically in vivo. Targeting JMJD6 or other identified elongation factors
extends survival in orthotopic xenograft mouse models, suggesting that targeting 
transcription elongation machinery may be an effective therapeutic strategy for
glioblastoma. More broadly, this study demonstrates the power of in vivo
phenotypic screening to identify new classes of 'cancer dependencies' not
identified by previous in vitro approaches, and could supply new opportunities
for therapeutic intervention.

The time of arrival of people in Australia is an unresolved question. It is
relevant to debates about when modern humans first dispersed out of Africa and
when their descendants incorporated genetic material from Neanderthals,
Denisovans and possibly other hominins. Humans have also been implicated in the
extinction of Australia's megafauna. Here we report the results of new
excavations conducted at Madjedbebe, a rock shelter in northern Australia.
Artefacts in primary depositional context are concentrated in three dense bands, 
with the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit demonstrated by artefact refits
and by optical dating and other analyses of the sediments. Human occupation began
around 65,000 years ago, with a distinctive stone tool assemblage including
grinding stones, ground ochres, reflective additives and ground-edge hatchet
heads. This evidence sets a new minimum age for the arrival of humans in
Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and the subsequent
interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans.

In soft ferromagnetic materials, the smoothly varying magnetization leads to the 
formation of fundamental patterns such as domains, vortices and domain walls.
These have been studied extensively in thin films of thicknesses up to around
200 nanometres, in which the magnetization is accessible with current
transmission imaging methods that make use of electrons or soft X-rays. In
thicker samples, however, in which the magnetization structure varies throughout 
the thickness and is intrinsically three dimensional, determining the complex
magnetic structure directly still represents a challenge. We have developed
hard-X-ray vector nanotomography with which to determine the three-dimensional
magnetic configuration at the nanoscale within micrometre-sized samples. We
imaged the structure of the magnetization within a soft magnetic pillar of
diameter 5 micrometres with a spatial resolution of 100 nanometres and, within
the bulk, observed a complex magnetic configuration that consists of vortices and
antivortices that form cross-tie walls and vortex walls along intersecting
planes. At the intersections of these structures, magnetic singularities-Bloch
points-occur. These were predicted more than fifty years ago but have so far not 
been directly observed. Here we image the three-dimensional magnetic structure in
the vicinity of the Bloch points, which until now has been accessible only
through micromagnetic simulations, and identify two possible magnetization
configurations: a circulating magnetization structure and a twisted state that
appears to correspond to an 'anti-Bloch point'. Our imaging method enables the
nanoscale study of topological magnetic structures in systems with sizes of the
order of tens of micrometres. Knowledge of internal nanomagnetic textures is
critical for understanding macroscopic magnetic properties and for designing bulk
magnets for technological applications.

The conservation laws, such as those of charge, energy and momentum, have a
central role in physics. In some special cases, classical conservation laws are
broken at the quantum level by quantum fluctuations, in which case the theory is 
said to have quantum anomalies. One of the most prominent examples is the chiral 
anomaly, which involves massless chiral fermions. These particles have their
spin, or internal angular momentum, aligned either parallel or antiparallel with 
their linear momentum, labelled as left and right chirality, respectively. In
three spatial dimensions, the chiral anomaly is the breakdown (as a result of
externally applied parallel electric and magnetic fields) of the classical
conservation law that dictates that the number of massless fermions of each
chirality are separately conserved. The current that measures the difference
between left- and right-handed particles is called the axial current and is not
conserved at the quantum level. In addition, an underlying curved space-time
provides a distinct contribution to a chiral imbalance, an effect known as the
mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, but this anomaly has yet to be confirmed
experimentally. However, the presence of a mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly has 
recently been tied to thermoelectrical transport in a magnetic field, even in
flat space-time, suggesting that such types of mixed anomaly could be
experimentally probed in condensed matter systems known as Weyl semimetals. Here,
using a temperature gradient, we observe experimentally a positive
magneto-thermoelectric conductance in the Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide (NbP) 
for collinear temperature gradients and magnetic fields that vanishes in the
ultra-quantum limit, when only a single Landau level is occupied. This
observation is consistent with the presence of a mixed axial-gravitational
anomaly, providing clear evidence for a theoretical concept that has so far
eluded experimental detection.

Molecular nitrogen (N2) is cheap and widely available, but its unreactive nature 
is a challenge when attempting to functionalize it under mild conditions with
other widely available substrates (such as carbon monoxide, CO) to produce
value-added compounds. Biological N2 fixation can do this, but the industrial
Haber-Bosch process for ammonia production operates under harsh conditions (450
degrees Celsius and 300 bar), even though both processes are thought to involve
multimetallic catalytic sites. And although molecular complexes capable of
binding and even reducing N2 under mild conditions are known, with co-operativity
between metal centres considered crucial for the N2 reduction step, the
multimetallic species involved are usually not well defined, and further
transformation of N2-binding complexes to achieve N-H or N-C bond formation is
rare. Haber noted, before an iron-based catalyst was adopted for the industrial
Haber-Bosch process, that uranium and uranium nitride materials are very
effective heterogeneous catalysts for ammonia production from N2. However, few
examples of uranium complexes binding N2 are known, and soluble uranium complexes
capable of transforming N2 into ammonia or organonitrogen compounds have not yet 
been identified. Here we report the four-electron reduction of N2 under ambient
conditions by a fully characterized complex with two Uiii ions and three K+
centres held together by a nitride group and a flexible metalloligand framework. 
The addition of H2 and/or protons, or CO to the resulting complex results in the 
complete cleavage of N2 with concomitant N2 functionalization through N-H or N-C 
bond-forming reactions. These observations establish that a molecular uranium
complex can promote the stoichiometric transformation of N2 into NH3 or cyanate, 
and that a flexible, electron-rich, multimetallic, nitride-bridged core unit is a
promising starting point for the design of molecular complexes capable of
cleaving and functionalizing N2 under mild conditions.

Many fine-scale features of ribosomes have been explained in terms of function,
revealing a molecular machine that is optimized for error-correction, speed and
control. Here we demonstrate mathematically that many less well understood,
larger-scale features of ribosomes-such as why a few ribosomal RNA molecules
dominate the mass and why the ribosomal protein content is divided into 55-80
small, similarly sized segments-speed up their autocatalytic production.

Current therapies for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant childhood brain tumour,
impose debilitating effects on the developing child, and highlight the need for
molecularly targeted treatments with reduced toxicity. Previous studies have been
unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that
operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape
across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity
among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver 
alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver
mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and
Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New
molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events,
including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking'
events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an
extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer
entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype
diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of
patients with medulloblastoma.

Since the discovery of topological insulators and semimetals, there has been much
research into predicting and experimentally discovering distinct classes of these
materials, in which the topology of electronic states leads to robust surface
states and electromagnetic responses. This apparent success, however, masks a
fundamental shortcoming: topological insulators represent only a few hundred of
the 200,000 stoichiometric compounds in material databases. However, it is
unclear whether this low number is indicative of the esoteric nature of
topological insulators or of a fundamental problem with the current approaches to
finding them. Here we propose a complete electronic band theory, which builds on 
the conventional band theory of electrons, highlighting the link between the
topology and local chemical bonding. This theory of topological quantum chemistry
provides a description of the universal (across materials), global properties of 
all possible band structures and (weakly correlated) materials, consisting of a
graph-theoretic description of momentum (reciprocal) space and a complementary
group-theoretic description in real space. For all 230 crystal symmetry groups,
we classify the possible band structures that arise from local atomic orbitals,
and show which are topologically non-trivial. Our electronic band theory sheds
new light on known topological insulators, and can be used to predict many more.

T cells directed against mutant neo-epitopes drive cancer immunity. However,
spontaneous immune recognition of mutations is inefficient. We recently
introduced the concept of individualized mutanome vaccines and implemented an
RNA-based poly-neo-epitope approach to mobilize immunity against a spectrum of
cancer mutations. Here we report the first-in-human application of this concept
in melanoma. We set up a process comprising comprehensive identification of
individual mutations, computational prediction of neo-epitopes, and design and
manufacturing of a vaccine unique for each patient. All patients developed T cell
responses against multiple vaccine neo-epitopes at up to high single-digit
percentages. Vaccine-induced T cell infiltration and neo-epitope-specific killing
of autologous tumour cells were shown in post-vaccination resected metastases
from two patients. The cumulative rate of metastatic events was highly
significantly reduced after the start of vaccination, resulting in a sustained
progression-free survival. Two of the five patients with metastatic disease
experienced vaccine-related objective responses. One of these patients had a late
relapse owing to outgrowth of β2-microglobulin-deficient melanoma cells as an
acquired resistance mechanism. A third patient developed a complete response to
vaccination in combination with PD-1 blockade therapy. Our study demonstrates
that individual mutations can be exploited, thereby opening a path to
personalized immunotherapy for patients with cancer.

Despite the wide variety of adaptive modifications in the oral and facial regions
of vertebrates, their early oropharyngeal development is considered strictly
uniform. It involves sequential formation of the mouth and pharyngeal pouches,
with ectoderm outlining the outer surface and endoderm the inner surface, as a
rule. At the extreme anterior domain of vertebrate embryos, the ectoderm and
endoderm directly juxtapose and initial development of this earliest
ecto-endoderm interface, the primary mouth, typically involves ectodermal
stomodeal invagination that limits the anterior expansion of the foregut
endoderm. Here we present evidence that in embryos of extant non-teleost fishes, 
oral (stomodeal) formation is preceded by the development of prominent pre-oral
gut diverticula (POGD) between the forebrain and roof of the forming mouth.
Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging of bichir, sturgeon and gar embryos 
revealed that foregut outpocketing at the pre-oral domain begins even before the 
sequential formation of pharyngeal pouches. The presence of foregut-derived cells
in the front of the mouth was further confirmed by in vivo experiments that
allowed specific tracing of the early endodermal lining. We show that POGD in
sturgeons contribute to the orofacial surface of their larvae, comprising oral
teeth, lips, and sensory barbels. To our knowledge, this is the first thorough
evidence for endodermal origin of external craniofacial structures in any
vertebrate. In bichir and gar embryos, POGD form prominent cranial adhesive
organs that are characteristic of the ancient bauplan of free-living chordate
larvae. POGD hence seem arguably to be ancestral for all ray-finned fishes, and
their topology, pharyngeal-like morphogenesis and gene expression suggest that
they are evolutionarily related to the foregut-derived diverticula of early
chordate and hemichordate embryos. The formation of POGD might thus represent an 
ancestral developmental module with deep deuterostome origins.

The lifestyle of intracellular pathogens, such as malaria parasites, is
intimately connected to that of their host, primarily for nutrient supply.
Nutrients act not only as primary sources of energy but also as regulators of
gene expression, metabolism and growth, through various signalling networks that 
enable cells to sense and adapt to varying environmental conditions. Canonical
nutrient-sensing pathways are presumed to be absent from the causative agent of
malaria, Plasmodium, thus raising the question of whether these parasites can
sense and cope with fluctuations in host nutrient levels. Here we show that
Plasmodium blood-stage parasites actively respond to host dietary calorie
alterations through rearrangement of their transcriptome accompanied by
substantial adjustment of their multiplication rate. A kinome analysis combined
with chemical and genetic approaches identified KIN as a critical regulator that 
mediates sensing of nutrients and controls a transcriptional response to the host
nutritional status. KIN shares homology with SNF1/AMPKα, and yeast
complementation studies suggest that it is part of a functionally conserved
cellular energy-sensing pathway. Overall, these findings reveal a key parasite
nutrient-sensing mechanism that is critical for modulating parasite replication
and virulence.

Effective anti-tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of
T cells directed at cancer neoantigens, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise 
from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not 
present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although
neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-tumour immune
response, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the
recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding 
mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict 
those mutated peptides with high-affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can
both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a
broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the
intra-tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate 
the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20
predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used
across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-type
antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six
vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while
two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1
(anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour
regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells.
These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach,
alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and there are
no mechanism-based therapies. The disease is defined by the presence of abundant 
neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex.
Neurofibrillary lesions comprise paired helical and straight tau filaments,
whereas tau filaments with different morphologies characterize other
neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are
available. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4-3.5 Å
resolution and corresponding atomic models of paired helical and straight
filaments from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease. Filament
cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306-378 of tau
protein, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-helix structure and define the seed for
tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their
inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs.
These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid
filaments from patient-derived material, and pave the way for investigation of a 
range of neurodegenerative diseases.

Water transported into Earth's interior by subduction strongly influences
dynamics such as volcanism and plate tectonics. Several recent studies have
reported hydrous minerals to be stable at pressure and temperature conditions
representative of Earth's deep interior, implying that surface water may be
transported as far as the core-mantle boundary. However, the hydrous mineral
goethite, α-FeOOH, was recently reported to decompose under the conditions of the
middle region of the lower mantle to form FeO2 and release H2, suggesting the
upward migration of hydrogen and large fluctuations in the oxygen distribution
within the Earth system. Here we report the stability of FeOOH phases at the
pressure and temperature conditions of the deep lower mantle, based on
first-principles calculations and in situ X-ray diffraction experiments. In
contrast to previous work suggesting the dehydrogenation of FeOOH into FeO2 in
the middle of the lower mantle, we report the formation of a new FeOOH phase with
the pyrite-type framework of FeO6 octahedra, which is much denser than the
surrounding mantle and is stable at the conditions of the base of the mantle.
Pyrite-type FeOOH may stabilize as a solid solution with other hydrous minerals
in deeply subducted slabs, and could form in subducted banded iron formations.
Deep-seated pyrite-type FeOOH eventually dissociates into Fe2O3 and releases H2O 
when subducted slabs are heated at the base of the mantle. This process may cause
the incorporation of hydrogen into the outer core by the formation of iron
hydride, FeHx, in the reducing environment of the core-mantle boundary.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders
that affect millions of people worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have
identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been
conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report
fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping 
in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant
with greater than 95% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single
variant with greater than 50% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly
enriched for protein-coding changes (n = 13), direct disruption of
transcription-factor binding sites (n = 3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks 
(n = 10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells
among associations stronger in Crohn's disease and in gut mucosa among
associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest
that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries
from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal
variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease 
mechanisms.

The stereoselective oxidation of hydrocarbons is one of the most notable advances
in synthetic chemistry over the past fifty years. Inspired by nature,
enantioselective dihydroxylations, epoxidations and other oxidations of
unsaturated hydrocarbons have been developed. More recently, the catalytic
enantioselective allylic carbon-hydrogen oxidation of alkenes has streamlined the
production of pharmaceuticals, natural products, fine chemicals and other
functional materials. Allylic functionalization provides a direct path to chiral 
building blocks with a newly formed stereocentre from petrochemical feedstocks
while preserving the olefin functionality as a handle for further chemical
elaboration. Various metal-based catalysts have been discovered for the
enantioselective allylic carbon-hydrogen oxidation of simple alkenes with cyclic 
or terminal double bonds. However, a general and selective allylic oxidation
using the more common internal alkenes remains elusive. Here we report the
enantioselective, regioselective and E/Z-selective allylic oxidation of
unactivated internal alkenes via a catalytic hetero-ene reaction with a
chalcogen-based oxidant. Our method enables non-symmetric internal alkenes to be 
selectively converted into allylic functionalized products with high
stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. Stereospecific transformations of the
resulting multifunctional chiral building blocks highlight the potential for
rapidly converting internal alkenes into a broad range of enantioenriched
structures that can be used in the synthesis of complex target molecules.

Gene silencing by heterochromatin is proposed to occur in part as a result of the
ability of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins to spread across large
regions of the genome, compact the underlying chromatin and recruit diverse
ligands. Here we identify a new property of the human HP1α protein: the ability
to form phase-separated droplets. While unmodified HP1α is soluble, either
phosphorylation of its N-terminal extension or DNA binding promotes the formation
of phase-separated droplets. Phosphorylation-driven phase separation can be
promoted or reversed by specific HP1α ligands. Known components of
heterochromatin such as nucleosomes and DNA preferentially partition into the
HP1α droplets, but molecules such as the transcription factor TFIIB show no
preference. Using a single-molecule DNA curtain assay, we find that both
unmodified and phosphorylated HP1α induce rapid compaction of DNA strands into
puncta, although with different characteristics. We show by direct protein
delivery into mammalian cells that an HP1α mutant incapable of phase separation
in vitro forms smaller and fewer nuclear puncta than phosphorylated HP1α. These
findings suggest that heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing may occur in part
through sequestration of compacted chromatin in phase-separated HP1 droplets,
which are dissolved or formed by specific ligands on the basis of nuclear
context.

Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes that
has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome stability, and
silencing of transposon and gene expression. Heterochromatin is highly enriched
for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone
H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner heterochromatin protein 1
(HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated
factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in steric exclusion of regulatory
proteins such as RNA polymerase from the underlying DNA. However, compaction
alone does not account for the formation of distinct, multi-chromosomal,
membrane-less heterochromatin domains within the nucleus, fast diffusion of
proteins inside the domain, and other dynamic features of heterochromatin. Here
we present data that support an alternative hypothesis: that the formation of
heterochromatin domains is mediated by phase separation, a phenomenon that gives 
rise to diverse non-membrane-bound nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular
compartments. We show that Drosophila HP1a protein undergoes liquid-liquid
demixing in vitro, and nucleates into foci that display liquid properties during 
the first stages of heterochromatin domain formation in early Drosophila embryos.
Furthermore, in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, heterochromatin domains
exhibit dynamics that are characteristic of liquid phase-separation, including
sensitivity to the disruption of weak hydrophobic interactions, and reduced
diffusion, increased coordinated movement and inert probe exclusion at the domain
boundary. We conclude that heterochromatic domains form via phase separation, and
mature into a structure that includes liquid and stable compartments. We propose 
that emergent biophysical properties associated with phase-separated systems are 
critical to understanding the unusual behaviours of heterochromatin, and how
chromatin domains in general regulate essential nuclear functions.

The regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart is limited, because of the
reduced ability of cardiomyocytes to progress through mitosis. Endogenous
cardiomyocytes have regenerative capacity at birth but this capacity is lost
postnatally, with subsequent organ growth occurring through cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy. The Hippo pathway, a conserved kinase cascade, inhibits
cardiomyocyte proliferation in the developing heart to control heart size and
prevents regeneration in the adult heart. The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
(DGC), a multicomponent transmembrane complex linking the actin cytoskeleton to
extracellular matrix, is essential for cardiomyocyte homeostasis. DGC deficiency 
in humans results in muscular dystrophy, including the lethal Duchenne muscular
dystrophy. Here we show that the DGC component dystroglycan 1 (Dag1) directly
binds to the Hippo pathway effector Yap to inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation in
mice. The Yap-Dag1 interaction was enhanced by Hippo-induced Yap phosphorylation,
revealing a connection between Hippo pathway function and the DGC. After injury, 
Hippo-deficient postnatal mouse hearts maintained organ size control by repairing
the defect with correct dimensions, whereas postnatal hearts deficient in both
Hippo and the DGC showed cardiomyocyte overproliferation at the injury site. In
the hearts of mature Mdx mice (which have a point mutation in Dmd)-a model of
Duchenne muscular dystrophy-Hippo deficiency protected against overload-induced
heart failure.

The adult mammalian heart is non-regenerative owing to the post-mitotic nature of
cardiomyocytes. The neonatal mouse heart can regenerate, but only during the
first week of life. Here we show that changes in the composition of the
extracellular matrix during this week can affect cardiomyocyte growth and
differentiation in mice. We identify agrin, a component of neonatal extracellular
matrix, as required for the full regenerative capacity of neonatal mouse hearts. 
In vitro, recombinant agrin promotes the division of cardiomyocytes that are
derived from mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cells through a mechanism
that involves the disassembly of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, and Yap-
and ERK-mediated signalling. In vivo, a single administration of agrin promotes
cardiac regeneration in adult mice after myocardial infarction, although the
degree of cardiomyocyte proliferation observed in this model suggests that there 
are additional therapeutic mechanisms. Together, our results uncover a new
inducer of mammalian heart regeneration and highlight fundamental roles of the
extracellular matrix in cardiac repair.

Anthropogenic activities have led to large-scale mercury (Hg) pollution in the
Arctic. It has been suggested that sea-salt-induced chemical cycling of Hg
(through 'atmospheric mercury depletion events', or AMDEs) and wet deposition via
precipitation are sources of Hg to the Arctic in its oxidized form (Hg(ii)).
However, there is little evidence for the occurrence of AMDEs outside of coastal 
regions, and their importance to net Hg deposition has been questioned.
Furthermore, wet-deposition measurements in the Arctic showed some of the lowest 
levels of Hg deposition via precipitation worldwide, raising questions as to the 
sources of high Arctic Hg loading. Here we present a comprehensive Hg-deposition 
mass-balance study, and show that most of the Hg (about 70%) in the interior
Arctic tundra is derived from gaseous elemental Hg (Hg(0)) deposition, with only 
minor contributions from the deposition of Hg(ii) via precipitation or AMDEs. We 
find that deposition of Hg(0)-the form ubiquitously present in the global
atmosphere-occurs throughout the year, and that it is enhanced in summer through 
the uptake of Hg(0) by vegetation. Tundra uptake of gaseous Hg(0) leads to high
soil Hg concentrations, with Hg masses greatly exceeding the levels found in
temperate soils. Our concurrent Hg stable isotope measurements in the atmosphere,
snowpack, vegetation and soils support our finding that Hg(0) dominates as a
source to the tundra. Hg concentration and stable isotope data from an
inland-to-coastal transect show high soil Hg concentrations consistently derived 
from Hg(0), suggesting that the Arctic tundra might be a globally important Hg
sink. We suggest that the high tundra soil Hg concentrations might also explain
why Arctic rivers annually transport large amounts of Hg to the Arctic Ocean.

In mammals, chromatin organization undergoes drastic reprogramming after
fertilization. However, the three-dimensional structure of chromatin and its
reprogramming in preimplantation development remain poorly understood. Here, by
developing a low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromosome conformation capture)
approach, we examined the reprogramming of chromatin organization during early
development in mice. We found that oocytes in metaphase II show homogeneous
chromatin folding that lacks detectable topologically associating domains (TADs) 
and chromatin compartments. Strikingly, chromatin shows greatly diminished
higher-order structure after fertilization. Unexpectedly, the subsequent
establishment of chromatin organization is a prolonged process that extends
through preimplantation development, as characterized by slow consolidation of
TADs and segregation of chromatin compartments. The two sets of parental
chromosomes are spatially separated from each other and display distinct
compartmentalization in zygotes. Such allele separation and allelic
compartmentalization can be found as late as the 8-cell stage. Finally, we show
that chromatin compaction in preimplantation embryos can partially proceed in the
absence of zygotic transcription and is a multi-level hierarchical process. Taken
together, our data suggest that chromatin may exist in a markedly relaxed state
after fertilization, followed by progressive maturation of higher-order chromatin
architecture during early development.

Quantum mechanics dictates that a continuous measurement of the position of an
object imposes a random quantum back-action (QBA) perturbation on its momentum.
This randomness translates with time into position uncertainty, thus leading to
the well known uncertainty on the measurement of motion. As a consequence of this
randomness, and in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the QBA 
puts a limitation-the so-called standard quantum limit-on the precision of
sensing of position, velocity and acceleration. Here we show that QBA on a
macroscopic mechanical oscillator can be evaded if the measurement of motion is
conducted in the reference frame of an atomic spin oscillator. The collective
quantum measurement on this hybrid system of two distant and disparate
oscillators is performed with light. The mechanical oscillator is a vibrational
'drum' mode of a millimetre-sized dielectric membrane, and the spin oscillator is
an atomic ensemble in a magnetic field. The spin oriented along the field
corresponds to an energetically inverted spin population and realizes a
negative-effective-mass oscillator, while the opposite orientation corresponds to
an oscillator with positive effective mass. The QBA is suppressed by -1.8
decibels in the negative-mass setting and enhanced by 2.4 decibels in the
positive-mass case. This hybrid quantum system paves the way to entanglement
generation and distant quantum communication between mechanical and spin systems 
and to sensing of force, motion and gravity beyond the standard quantum limit.

In contrast to the DNA-based viruses in prokaryotes, the emergence of eukaryotes 
provided the necessary compartmentalization and membranous environment for RNA
viruses to flourish, creating the need for an RNA-targeting antiviral system.
Present day eukaryotes employ at least two main defence strategies that emerged
as a result of this viral shift, namely antiviral RNA interference and the
interferon system. Here we demonstrate that Drosha and related RNase III
ribonucleases from all three domains of life also elicit a unique RNA-targeting
antiviral activity. Systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment of
this class of proteins illustrates the recognition of unbranched RNA stem loops. 
Biochemical analyses reveal that, in this context, Drosha functions as an
antiviral clamp, conferring steric hindrance on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases
of diverse positive-stranded RNA viruses. We present evidence for cytoplasmic
translocation of RNase III nucleases in response to virus in diverse eukaryotes
including plants, arthropods, fish, and mammals. These data implicate RNase III
recognition of viral RNA as an antiviral defence that is independent of, and
possibly predates, other known eukaryotic antiviral systems.

Mechanosensory transduction for senses such as proprioception, touch, balance,
acceleration, hearing and pain relies on mechanotransduction channels, which
convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in specialized sensory cells. 
How force gates mechanotransduction channels is a central question in the field, 
for which there are two major models. One is the membrane-tension model: force
applied to the membrane generates a change in membrane tension that is sufficient
to gate the channel, as in the bacterial MscL channel and certain eukaryotic
potassium channels. The other is the tether model: force is transmitted via a
tether to gate the channel. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel NOMPC 
is important for mechanosensation-related behaviours such as locomotion, touch
and sound sensation across different species including Caenorhabditis elegans,
Drosophila and zebrafish. NOMPC is the founding member of the TRPN subfamily, and
is thought to be gated by tethering of its ankyrin repeat domain to microtubules 
of the cytoskeleton. Thus, a goal of studying NOMPC is to reveal the underlying
mechanism of force-induced gating, which could serve as a paradigm of the tether 
model. NOMPC fulfils all the criteria that apply to mechanotransduction channels 
and has 29 ankyrin repeats, the largest number among TRP channels. A key question
is how the long ankyrin repeat domain is organized as a tether that can trigger
channel gating. Here we present a de novo atomic structure of Drosophila NOMPC
determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. Structural analysis
suggests that the ankyrin repeat domain of NOMPC resembles a helical spring,
suggesting its role of linking mechanical displacement of the cytoskeleton to the
opening of the channel. The NOMPC architecture underscores the basis of
translating mechanical force into an electrical signal within a cell.

Genomic analysis of tumours has led to the identification of hundreds of cancer
genes on the basis of the presence of mutations in protein-coding regions. By
contrast, much less is known about cancer-causing mutations in non-coding
regions. Here we perform deep sequencing in 360 primary breast cancers and
develop computational methods to identify significantly mutated promoters. Clear 
signals are found in the promoters of three genes. FOXA1, a known driver of
hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, harbours a mutational hotspot in its
promoter leading to overexpression through increased E2F binding. RMRP and NEAT1,
two non-coding RNA genes, carry mutations that affect protein binding to their
promoters and alter expression levels. Our study shows that promoter regions
harbour recurrent mutations in cancer with functional consequences and that the
mutations occur at similar frequencies as in coding regions. Power analyses
indicate that more such regions remain to be discovered through deep sequencing
of adequately sized cohorts of patients.

Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity occurs almost exclusively in ice-free areas
that cover less than 1% of the continent. Climate change will alter the extent
and configuration of ice-free areas, yet the distribution and severity of these
effects remain unclear. Here we quantify the impact of twenty-first century
climate change on ice-free areas under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) climate forcing scenarios using temperature-index melt modelling.
Under the strongest forcing scenario, ice-free areas could expand by over
17,000 km2 by the end of the century, close to a 25% increase. Most of this
expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in
ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of
biodiversity habitat. Isolated ice-free areas will coalesce, and while the
effects on biodiversity are uncertain, we hypothesize that they could eventually 
lead to increasing regional-scale biotic homogenization, the extinction of
less-competitive species and the spread of invasive species.

Activation of the PTEN-PI3K-mTORC1 pathway consolidates metabolic programs that
sustain cancer cell growth and proliferation. Here we show that mechanistic
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates polyamine dynamics, a metabolic 
route that is essential for oncogenicity. By using integrative metabolomics in a 
mouse model and human biopsies of prostate cancer, we identify alterations in
tumours affecting the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM)
and polyamine synthesis. Mechanistically, this metabolic rewiring stems from
mTORC1-dependent regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1)
stability. This novel molecular regulation is validated in mouse and human cancer
specimens. AMD1 is upregulated in human prostate cancer with activated mTORC1.
Conversely, samples from a clinical trial with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus
exhibit a predominant decrease in AMD1 immunoreactivity that is associated with a
decrease in proliferation, in line with the requirement of dcSAM production for
oncogenicity. These findings provide fundamental information about the complex
regulatory landscape controlled by mTORC1 to integrate and translate growth
signals into an oncogenic metabolic program.

In acute myeloid leukaemia, long-term survival is poor as most patients relapse
despite achieving remission. Historically, the failure of therapy has been
thought to be due to mutations that produce drug resistance, possibly arising as 
a consequence of the mutagenic properties of chemotherapy drugs. However, other
lines of evidence have pointed to the pre-existence of drug-resistant cells. For 
example, deep sequencing of paired diagnosis and relapse acute myeloid leukaemia 
samples has provided direct evidence that relapse in some cases is generated from
minor genetic subclones present at diagnosis that survive chemotherapy,
suggesting that resistant cells are generated by evolutionary processes before
treatment and are selected by therapy. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of therapy
failure and capacity for leukaemic regeneration remain obscure, as sequence
analysis alone does not provide insight into the cell types that are fated to
drive relapse. Although leukaemia stem cells have been linked to relapse owing to
their dormancy and self-renewal properties, and leukaemia stem cell gene
expression signatures are highly predictive of therapy failure, experimental
studies have been primarily correlative and a role for leukaemia stem cells in
acute myeloid leukaemia relapse has not been directly proved. Here, through
combined genetic and functional analysis of purified subpopulations and
xenografts from paired diagnosis/relapse samples, we identify therapy-resistant
cells already present at diagnosis and two major patterns of relapse. In some
cases, relapse originated from rare leukaemia stem cells with a haematopoietic
stem/progenitor cell phenotype, while in other instances relapse developed from
larger subclones of immunophenotypically committed leukaemia cells that retained 
strong stemness transcriptional signatures. The identification of distinct
patterns of relapse should lead to improved methods for disease management and
monitoring in acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, the shared functional and
transcriptional stemness properties that underlie both cellular origins of
relapse emphasize the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches that
target stemness to prevent relapse.

The functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds is one of the most
attractive strategies for molecular construction in organic chemistry. The
hydrogen atom is considered to be an ideal coupling handle, owing to its relative
abundance in organic molecules and its availability for functionalization at
almost any stage in a synthetic sequence. Although many C-H functionalization
reactions involve C(sp3)-C(sp2) coupling, there is a growing demand for C-H
alkylation reactions, wherein sp3 C-H bonds are replaced with sp3 C-alkyl groups.
Here we describe a polarity-match-based selective sp3 C-H alkylation via the
combination of photoredox, nickel and hydrogen-atom transfer catalysis. This
methodology simultaneously uses three catalytic cycles to achieve hydridic C-H
bond abstraction (enabled by polarity matching), alkyl halide oxidative addition,
and reductive elimination to enable alkyl-alkyl fragment coupling. The sp3 C-H
alkylation is highly selective for the α-C-H of amines, ethers and sulphides,
which are commonly found in pharmaceutically relevant architectures. This
cross-coupling protocol should enable broad synthetic applications in de novo
synthesis and late-stage functionalization chemistry.

T cells are defined by a heterodimeric surface receptor, the T cell receptor
(TCR), that mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through
interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs). TCRs
are generated by genomic rearrangement of the germline TCR locus, a process
termed V(D)J recombination, that has the potential to generate marked diversity
of TCRs (estimated to range from 1015 (ref. 1) to as high as 1061 (ref. 2)
possible receptors). Despite this potential diversity, TCRs from T cells that
recognize the same pMHC epitope often share conserved sequence features,
suggesting that it may be possible to predictively model epitope specificity.
Here we report the in-depth characterization of ten epitope-specific TCR
repertoires of CD8+ T cells from mice and humans, representing over 4,600
in-frame single-cell-derived TCRαβ sequence pairs from 110 subjects. We developed
analytical tools to characterize these epitope-specific repertoires: a distance
measure on the space of TCRs that permits clustering and visualization, a robust 
repertoire diversity metric that accommodates the low number of paired public
receptors observed when compared to single-chain analyses, and a distance-based
classifier that can assign previously unobserved TCRs to characterized
repertoires with robust sensitivity and specificity. Our analyses demonstrate
that each epitope-specific repertoire contains a clustered group of receptors
that share core sequence similarities, together with a dispersed set of diverse
'outlier' sequences. By identifying shared motifs in core sequences, we were able
to highlight key conserved residues driving essential elements of TCR
recognition. These analyses provide insights into the generalizable, underlying
features of epitope-specific repertoires and adaptive immune recognition.

T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are very diverse, with many more possible
sequence combinations than T cells in any one individual. Here we define the
minimal requirements for TCR antigen specificity, through an analysis of TCR
sequences using a panel of peptide and major histocompatibility complex
(pMHC)-tetramer-sorted cells and structural data. From this analysis we developed
an algorithm that we term GLIPH (grouping of lymphocyte interactions by paratope 
hotspots) to cluster TCRs with a high probability of sharing specificity owing to
both conserved motifs and global similarity of complementarity-determining region
3 (CDR3) sequences. We show that GLIPH can reliably group TCRs of common
specificity from different donors, and that conserved CDR3 motifs help to define 
the TCR clusters that are often contact points with the antigenic peptides. As an
independent validation, we analysed 5,711 TCRβ chain sequences from reactive CD4 
T cells from 22 individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. We 
found 141 TCR specificity groups, including 16 distinct groups containing TCRs
from multiple individuals. These TCR groups typically shared HLA alleles,
allowing prediction of the likely HLA restriction, and a large number of M.
tuberculosis T cell epitopes enabled us to identify pMHC ligands for all five of 
the groups tested. Mutagenesis and de novo TCR design confirmed that the
GLIPH-identified motifs were critical and sufficient for shared-antigen
recognition. Thus the GLIPH algorithm can analyse large numbers of TCR sequences 
and define TCR specificity groups shared by TCRs and individuals, which should
greatly accelerate the analysis of T cell responses and expedite the
identification of specific ligands.

G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signal transduction is central to
human physiology and disease intervention, yet the molecular mechanisms
responsible for ligand-dependent signalling responses remain poorly understood.
In class A GPCRs, receptor activation and G-protein coupling entail outward
movements of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6). Here, using single-molecule
fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we examine TM6 movements in the
β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) upon exposure to orthosteric ligands with different
efficacies, in the absence and presence of the Gs heterotrimer. We show that
partial and full agonists differentially affect TM6 motions to regulate the rate 
at which GDP-bound β2AR-Gs complexes are formed and the efficiency of nucleotide 
exchange leading to Gs activation. These data also reveal transient
nucleotide-bound β2AR-Gs species that are distinct from known structures, and
provide single-molecule perspectives on the allosteric link between ligand- and
nucleotide-binding pockets that shed new light on the G-protein activation
mechanism.

Pyroptosis is a form of cell death that is critical for immunity. It can be
induced by the canonical caspase-1 inflammasomes or by activation of caspase-4,
-5 and -11 by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide. The caspases cleave gasdermin D
(GSDMD) in its middle linker to release autoinhibition on its gasdermin-N domain,
which executes pyroptosis via its pore-forming activity. GSDMD belongs to a
gasdermin family that shares the pore-forming domain. The functions and
mechanisms of activation of other gasdermins are unknown. Here we show that
GSDME, which was originally identified as DFNA5 (deafness, autosomal dominant 5),
can switch caspase-3-mediated apoptosis induced by TNF or chemotherapy drugs to
pyroptosis. GSDME was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 in its linker, generating
a GSDME-N fragment that perforates membranes and thereby induces pyroptosis.
After chemotherapy, cleavage of GSDME by caspase-3 induced pyroptosis in certain 
GSDME-expressing cancer cells. GSDME was silenced in most cancer cells but
expressed in many normal tissues. Human primary cells exhibited GSDME-dependent
pyroptosis upon activation of caspase-3 by chemotherapy drugs. Gsdme-/- (also
known as Dfna5-/-) mice were protected from chemotherapy-induced tissue damage
and weight loss. These findings suggest that caspase-3 activation can trigger
necrosis by cleaving GSDME and offer new insights into cancer chemotherapy.

Episodic kinematics in continental rifts modulated by changes in mantle melt
fraction.

Oceanic crust is created by the extraction of molten rock from underlying mantle 
at the seafloor 'spreading centres' found between diverging tectonic plates.
Modelling studies have suggested that mantle melting can occur through
decompression as the mantle flows upwards beneath spreading centres, but direct
observation of this process is difficult beneath the oceans. Continental rifts,
however-which are also associated with mantle melt production-are amenable to
detailed measurements of their short-term kinematics using geodetic techniques.
Here we show that such data can provide evidence for an upwelling mantle flow, as
well as information on the dimensions and timescale of mantle melting. For North 
Island, New Zealand, around ten years of campaign and continuous GPS measurements
in the continental rift system known as the Taupo volcanic zone reveal that it is
extending at a rate of 6-15 millimetres per year. However, a roughly
70-kilometre-long segment of the rift axis is associated with strong horizontal
contraction and rapid subsidence, and is flanked by regions of extension and
uplift. These features fit a simple model that involves flexure of an elastic
upper crust, which is pulled downwards or pushed upwards along the rift axis by a
driving force located at a depth greater than 15 kilometres. We propose that
flexure is caused by melt-induced episodic changes in the vertical flow forces
that are generated by upwelling mantle beneath the rift axis, triggering a
transient lower-crustal flow. A drop in the melt fraction owing to melt
extraction raises the mantle flow viscosity and drives subsidence, whereas melt
accumulation reduces viscosity and allows uplift-processes that are also likely
to occur in oceanic spreading centres.

Glaciological and oceanographic observations coupled with numerical models show
that warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) incursions onto the West Antarctic
continental shelf cause melting of the undersides of floating ice shelves.
Because these ice shelves buttress glaciers feeding into them, their
ocean-induced thinning is driving Antarctic ice-sheet retreat today. Here we
present a multi-proxy data based reconstruction of variability in CDW inflow to
the Amundsen Sea sector, the most vulnerable part of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet, during the Holocene epoch (from 11.7 thousand years ago to the present).
The chemical compositions of foraminifer shells and benthic foraminifer
assemblages in marine sediments indicate that enhanced CDW upwelling, controlled 
by the latitudinal position of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds, forced
deglaciation of this sector from at least 10,400 years ago until 7,500 years
ago-when an ice-shelf collapse may have caused rapid ice-sheet thinning further
upstream-and since the 1940s. These results increase confidence in the predictive
capability of current ice-sheet models.

Chromosomes in proliferating metazoan cells undergo marked structural
metamorphoses every cell cycle, alternating between highly condensed mitotic
structures that facilitate chromosome segregation, and decondensed interphase
structures that accommodate transcription, gene silencing and DNA replication.
Here we use single-cell Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture)
analysis to study chromosome conformations in thousands of individual cells, and 
discover a continuum of cis-interaction profiles that finely position individual 
cells along the cell cycle. We show that chromosomal compartments,
topological-associated domains (TADs), contact insulation and long-range loops,
all defined by bulk Hi-C maps, are governed by distinct cell-cycle dynamics. In
particular, DNA replication correlates with a build-up of compartments and a
reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 to S and G2
phase. Whole-genome three-dimensional structural models reveal a radial
architecture of chromosomal compartments with distinct epigenomic signatures. Our
single-cell data therefore allow re-interpretation of chromosome conformation
maps through the prism of the cell cycle.

The computing demands of future data-intensive applications will greatly exceed
the capabilities of current electronics, and are unlikely to be met by isolated
improvements in transistors, data storage technologies or integrated circuit
architectures alone. Instead, transformative nanosystems, which use new
nanotechnologies to simultaneously realize improved devices and new integrated
circuit architectures, are required. Here we present a prototype of such a
transformative nanosystem. It consists of more than one million resistive
random-access memory cells and more than two million carbon-nanotube field-effect
transistors-promising new nanotechnologies for use in energy-efficient digital
logic circuits and for dense data storage-fabricated on vertically stacked layers
in a single chip. Unlike conventional integrated circuit architectures, the
layered fabrication realizes a three-dimensional integrated circuit architecture 
with fine-grained and dense vertical connectivity between layers of computing,
data storage, and input and output (in this instance, sensing). As a result, our 
nanosystem can capture massive amounts of data every second, store it directly
on-chip, perform in situ processing of the captured data, and produce 'highly
processed' information. As a working prototype, our nanosystem senses and
classifies ambient gases. Furthermore, because the layers are fabricated on top
of silicon logic circuitry, our nanosystem is compatible with existing
infrastructure for silicon-based technologies. Such complex nano-electronic
systems will be essential for future high-performance and highly energy-efficient
electronic systems.

Ribosomes have the capacity to selectively control translation through changes in
their composition that enable recognition of specific RNA elements. However,
beyond differential subunit expression during development, evidence for regulated
ribosome specification within individual cells has remained elusive. Here we
report that a poxvirus kinase phosphorylates serine/threonine residues in the
human small ribosomal subunit protein, receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1),
that are not phosphorylated in uninfected cells or cells infected by other
viruses. These modified residues cluster in an extended loop in RACK1,
phosphorylation of which selects for translation of viral or reporter mRNAs with 
5' untranslated regions that contain adenosine repeats, so-called polyA-leaders. 
Structural and phylogenetic analyses revealed that although RACK1 is highly
conserved, this loop is variable and contains negatively charged amino acids in
plants, in which these leaders act as translational enhancers. Phosphomimetics
and inter-species chimaeras have shown that negative charge in the RACK1 loop
dictates ribosome selectivity towards viral RNAs. By converting human RACK1 to a 
charged, plant-like state, poxviruses remodel host ribosomes so that adenosine
repeats erroneously generated by slippage of the viral RNA polymerase confer a
translational advantage. Our findings provide insight into ribosome customization
through trans-kingdom mimicry and the mechanics of species-specific leader
activity that underlie poxvirus polyA-leaders.

Cellular potassium import systems play a fundamental role in osmoregulation, pH
homeostasis and membrane potential in all domains of life. In bacteria, the kdp
operon encodes a four-subunit potassium pump that maintains intracellular
homeostasis, cell shape and turgor under conditions in which potassium is
limiting. This membrane complex, called KdpFABC, has one channel-like subunit
(KdpA) belonging to the superfamily of potassium transporters and another
pump-like subunit (KdpB) belonging to the superfamily of P-type ATPases. Although
there is considerable structural and functional information about members of both
superfamilies, the mechanism by which uphill potassium transport through KdpA is 
coupled with ATP hydrolysis by KdpB remains poorly understood. Here we report the
2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a
potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a
canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB. The structure also
reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these
two subunits. Specifically, a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these
potassium and water sites and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is
linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB. On the basis of these observations,
we propose a mechanism that repurposes protein channel architecture for active
transport across biomembranes.

Phylogenetic analysis of early tetrapod evolution has resulted in a consensus
across diverse data sets in which the tetrapod stem group is a relatively
homogenous collection of medium- to large-sized animals showing a progressive
loss of 'fish' characters as they become increasingly terrestrial, whereas the
crown group demonstrates marked morphological diversity and disparity. The oldest
fossil attributed to the tetrapod crown group is the highly specialized aïstopod 
Lethiscus stocki, which shows a small size, extreme axial elongation, loss of
limbs, spool-shaped vertebral centra, and a skull with reduced centres of
ossification, in common with an otherwise disparate group of small animals known 
as lepospondyls. Here we use micro-computed tomography of the only known specimen
of Lethiscus to provide new information that strongly challenges this consensus. 
Digital dissection reveals extremely primitive cranial morphology, including a
spiracular notch, a large remnant of the notochord within the braincase, an open 
ventral cranial fissure, an anteriorly restricted parasphenoid element, and
Meckelian ossifications. The braincase is elongate and lies atop a dorsally
projecting septum of the parasphenoid bone, similar to stem tetrapods such as
embolomeres. This morphology is consistent in a second aïstopod, Coloraderpeton, 
although the details differ. Phylogenetic analysis, including critical new
braincase data, places aïstopods deep on the tetrapod stem, whereas another major
lepospondyl lineage is displaced into the amniotes. These results show that stem 
group tetrapods were much more diverse in their body plans than previously
thought. Our study requires a change in commonly used calibration dates for
molecular analyses, and emphasizes the importance of character sampling for early
tetrapod evolutionary relationships.

Rotavirus, a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhoea in young
children, accounts for around 215,000 deaths annually worldwide. Rotavirus
specifically infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the host small intestine 
and has evolved strategies to antagonize interferon and NF-κB signalling, raising
the question as to whether other host factors participate in antiviral responses 
in intestinal mucosa. The mechanism by which enteric viruses are sensed and
restricted in vivo, especially by NOD-like receptor (NLR) inflammasomes, is
largely unknown. Here we uncover and mechanistically characterize the NLR Nlrp9b 
that is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and restricts
rotavirus infection. Our data show that, via RNA helicase Dhx9, Nlrp9b recognizes
short double-stranded RNA stretches and forms inflammasome complexes with the
adaptor proteins Asc and caspase-1 to promote the maturation of interleukin
(Il)-18 and gasdermin D (Gsdmd)-induced pyroptosis. Conditional depletion of
Nlrp9b or other inflammasome components in the intestine in vivo resulted in
enhanced susceptibility of mice to rotavirus replication. Our study highlights an
important innate immune signalling pathway that functions in intestinal
epithelial cells and may present useful targets in the modulation of host
defences against viral pathogens.

The spontaneous growth of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) into cloud droplets
under supersaturated water vapour conditions is described by classic Köhler
theory. This spontaneous activation of CCN depends on the interplay between the
Raoult effect, whereby activation potential increases with decreasing water
activity or increasing solute concentration, and the Kelvin effect, whereby
activation potential decreases with decreasing droplet size or increases with
decreasing surface tension, which is sensitive to surfactants. Surface tension
lowering caused by organic surfactants, which diminishes the Kelvin effect, is
expected to be negated by a concomitant reduction in the Raoult effect, driven by
the displacement of surfactant molecules from the droplet bulk to the
droplet-vapour interface. Here we present observational and theoretical evidence 
illustrating that, in ambient air, surface tension lowering can prevail over the 
reduction in the Raoult effect, leading to substantial increases in cloud droplet
concentrations. We suggest that consideration of liquid-liquid phase separation, 
leading to complete or partial engulfing of a hygroscopic particle core by a
hydrophobic organic-rich phase, can explain the lack of concomitant reduction of 
the Raoult effect, while maintaining substantial lowering of surface tension,
even for partial surface coverage. Apart from the importance of particle size and
composition in droplet activation, we show by observation and modelling that
incorporation of phase-separation effects into activation thermodynamics can lead
to a CCN number concentration that is up to ten times what is predicted by
climate models, changing the properties of clouds. An adequate representation of 
the CCN activation process is essential to the prediction of clouds in climate
models, and given the effect of clouds on the Earth's energy balance, improved
prediction of aerosol-cloud-climate interactions is likely to result in improved 
assessments of future climate change.

Genetic studies have shown the association of Parkinson's disease with alleles of
the major histocompatibility complex. Here we show that a defined set of peptides
that are derived from α-synuclein, a protein aggregated in Parkinson's disease,
act as antigenic epitopes displayed by these alleles and drive helper and
cytotoxic T cell responses in patients with Parkinson's disease. These responses 
may explain the association of Parkinson's disease with specific major
histocompatibility complex alleles.

The majority of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, with viruses
that originate in wild mammals of particular concern (for example, HIV, Ebola and
SARS). Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of 
successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for 
pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify
which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses
can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of
mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses
that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are
predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic
viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host
taxonomy and human population within a species range-which may reflect
human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher
proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify 
the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing
viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future
surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits 
are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to 
assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.

In quantum field theory, Lorentz invariance leads to three types of
fermion-Dirac, Weyl and Majorana. Although the existence of Weyl and Majorana
fermions as elementary particles in high-energy physics is debated, all three
types of fermion have been proposed to exist as low-energy, long-wavelength
quasiparticle excitations in condensed-matter systems. The existence of Dirac and
Weyl fermions in condensed-matter systems has been confirmed experimentally, and 
that of Majorana fermions is supported by various experiments. However, in
condensed-matter systems, fermions in crystals are constrained by the symmetries 
of the 230 crystal space groups rather than by Lorentz invariance, giving rise to
the possibility of finding other types of fermionic excitation that have no
counterparts in high-energy physics. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy to demonstrate the existence of a triply degenerate point in the
electronic structure of crystalline molybdenum phosphide. Quasiparticle
excitations near a triply degenerate point are three-component fermions, beyond
the conventional Dirac-Weyl-Majorana classification, which attributes Dirac and
Weyl fermions to four- and two-fold degenerate points, respectively. We also
observe pairs of Weyl points in the bulk electronic structure of the crystal that
coexist with the three-component fermions. This material thus represents a
platform for studying the interplay between different types of fermions. Our
experimental discovery opens up a way of exploring the new physics of
unconventional fermions in condensed-matter systems.

Physiological needs bias perception and attention to relevant sensory cues. This 
process is 'hijacked' by drug addiction, causing cue-induced cravings and
relapse. Similarly, its dysregulation contributes to failed diets, obesity, and
eating disorders. Neuroimaging studies in humans have implicated insular cortex
in these phenomena. However, it remains unclear how 'cognitive' cortical
representations of motivationally relevant cues are biased by subcortical
circuits that drive specific motivational states. Here we develop a
microprism-based cellular imaging approach to monitor visual cue responses in the
insular cortex of behaving mice across hunger states. Insular cortex neurons
demonstrate food-cue-biased responses that are abolished during satiety.
Unexpectedly, while multiple satiety-related visceral signals converge in insular
cortex, chemogenetic activation of hypothalamic 'hunger neurons' (expressing
agouti-related peptide (AgRP)) bypasses these signals to restore hunger-like
response patterns in insular cortex. Circuit mapping and pathway-specific
manipulations uncover a pathway from AgRP neurons to insular cortex via the
paraventricular thalamus and basolateral amygdala. These results reveal a neural 
basis for state-specific biased processing of motivationally relevant cues.

Half of all prostate cancers are caused by the TMPRSS2-ERG gene-fusion, which
enables androgens to drive expression of the normally silent E26
transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ERG in prostate cells. Recent 
genomic landscape studies of such cancers have reported recurrent point mutations
and focal deletions of another ETS member, the ETS2 repressor factor ERF. Here we
show these ERF mutations cause decreased protein stability and mostly occur in
tumours without ERG upregulation. ERF loss recapitulates the morphological and
phenotypic features of ERG gain in normal mouse prostate cells, including
expansion of the androgen receptor transcriptional repertoire, and ERF has tumour
suppressor activity in the same genetic background of Pten loss that yields
oncogenic activity by ERG. In the more common scenario of ERG upregulation,
chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicates that ERG inhibits 
the ability of ERF to bind DNA at consensus ETS sites both in normal and in
cancerous prostate cells. Consistent with a competition model, ERF overexpression
blocks ERG-dependent tumour growth, and ERF loss rescues TMPRSS2-ERG-positive
prostate cancer cells from ERG dependency. Collectively, these data provide
evidence that the oncogenicity of ERG is mediated, in part, by competition with
ERF and they raise the larger question of whether other gain-of-function
oncogenic transcription factors might also inactivate endogenous tumour
suppressors.

During gestation the developing human fetus is exposed to a diverse range of
potentially immune-stimulatory molecules including semi-allogeneic antigens from 
maternal cells, substances from ingested amniotic fluid, food antigens, and
microbes. Yet the capacity of the fetal immune system, including
antigen-presenting cells, to detect and respond to such stimuli remains unclear. 
In particular, dendritic cells, which are crucial for effective immunity and
tolerance, remain poorly characterized in the developing fetus. Here we show that
subsets of antigen-presenting cells can be identified in fetal tissues and are
related to adult populations of antigen-presenting cells. Similar to adult
dendritic cells, fetal dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes and respond to
toll-like receptor ligation; however, they differ markedly in their response to
allogeneic antigens, strongly promoting regulatory T-cell induction and
inhibiting T-cell tumour-necrosis factor-α production through arginase-2
activity. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of dendritic cells
within the developing fetus and indicate that they mediate homeostatic
immune-suppressive responses during gestation.

Intron removal requires assembly of the spliceosome on precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) 
and extensive remodelling to form the spliceosome's catalytic centre. Here we
report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae pre-catalytic B complex spliceosome at near-atomic resolution. The
mobile U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) associates with
U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP through the U2/U6 helix II and an interface between U4/U6
di-snRNP and the U2 snRNP SF3b-containing domain, which also transiently contacts
the helicase Brr2. The 3' region of the U2 snRNP is flexibly attached to the
SF3b-containing domain and protrudes over the concave surface of tri-snRNP, where
the U1 snRNP may reside before its release from the pre-mRNA 5' splice site. The 
U6 ACAGAGA sequence forms a hairpin that weakly tethers the 5' splice site. The B
complex proteins Prp38, Snu23 and Spp381 bind the Prp8 N-terminal domain and
stabilize U6 ACAGAGA stem-pre-mRNA and Brr2-U4 small nuclear RNA interactions.
These results provide important insights into the events leading to active site
formation.

Optical quantum states based on entangled photons are essential for solving
questions in fundamental physics and are at the heart of quantum information
science. Specifically, the realization of high-dimensional states (D-level
quantum systems, that is, qudits, with D > 2) and their control are necessary for
fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics, for increasing the sensitivity
of quantum imaging schemes, for improving the robustness and key rate of quantum 
communication protocols, for enabling a richer variety of quantum simulations,
and for achieving more efficient and error-tolerant quantum computation.
Integrated photonics has recently become a leading platform for the compact,
cost-efficient, and stable generation and processing of non-classical optical
states. However, so far, integrated entangled quantum sources have been limited
to qubits (D = 2). Here we demonstrate on-chip generation of entangled qudit
states, where the photons are created in a coherent superposition of multiple
high-purity frequency modes. In particular, we confirm the realization of a
quantum system with at least one hundred dimensions, formed by two entangled
qudits with D = 10. Furthermore, using state-of-the-art, yet off-the-shelf
telecommunications components, we introduce a coherent manipulation platform with
which to control frequency-entangled states, capable of performing deterministic 
high-dimensional gate operations. We validate this platform by measuring Bell
inequality violations and performing quantum state tomography. Our work enables
the generation and processing of high-dimensional quantum states in a single
spatial mode.

Oscillating materials that adapt their shapes in response to external stimuli are
of interest for emerging applications in medicine and robotics. For example,
liquid-crystal networks can be programmed to undergo stimulus-induced
deformations in various geometries, including in response to light. Azobenzene
molecules are often incorporated into liquid-crystal polymer films to make them
photoresponsive; however, in most cases only the bending responses of these films
have been studied, and relaxation after photo-isomerization is rather slow.
Modifying the core or adding substituents to the azobenzene moiety can lead to
marked changes in photophysical and photochemical properties, providing an
opportunity to circumvent the use of a complex set-up that involves multiple
light sources, lenses or mirrors. Here, by incorporating azobenzene derivatives
with fast cis-to-trans thermal relaxation into liquid-crystal networks, we
generate photoactive polymer films that exhibit continuous, directional,
macroscopic mechanical waves under constant light illumination, with a feedback
loop that is driven by self-shadowing. We explain the mechanism of wave
generation using a theoretical model and numerical simulations, which show good
qualitative agreement with our experiments. We also demonstrate the potential
application of our photoactive films in light-driven locomotion and self-cleaning
surfaces, and anticipate further applications in fields such as photomechanical
energy harvesting and miniaturized transport.

Cutaneous melanoma is a type of cancer with an inherent potential for lymph node 
colonization, which is generally preceded by neolymphangiogenesis. However,
sentinel lymph node removal does not necessarily extend the overall survival of
patients with melanoma. Moreover, lymphatic vessels collapse and become
dysfunctional as melanomas progress. Therefore, it is unclear whether (and how)
lymphangiogenesis contributes to visceral metastasis. Soluble and
vesicle-associated proteins secreted by tumours and/or their stroma have been
proposed to condition pre-metastatic sites in patients with melanoma. Still, the 
identities and prognostic value of lymphangiogenic mediators remain unclear.
Moreover, our understanding of lymphangiogenesis (in melanomas and other tumour
types) is limited by the paucity of mouse models for live imaging of distal
pre-metastatic niches. Injectable lymphatic tracers have been developed, but
their limited diffusion precludes whole-body imaging at visceral sites. Vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is an attractive 'lymphoreporter'
because its expression is strongly downregulated in normal adult lymphatic
endothelial cells, but is activated in pathological situations such as
inflammation and cancer. Here, we exploit this inducibility of VEGFR3 to engineer
mouse melanoma models for whole-body imaging of metastasis generated by human
cells, clinical biopsies or endogenously deregulated oncogenic pathways. This
strategy revealed early induction of distal pre-metastatic niches uncoupled from 
lymphangiogenesis at primary lesions. Analyses of the melanoma secretome and
validation in clinical specimens showed that the heparin-binding factor midkine
is a systemic inducer of neo-lymphangiogenesis that defines patient prognosis.
This role of midkine was linked to a paracrine activation of the mTOR pathway in 
lymphatic endothelial cells. These data support the use of VEGFR3 reporter mice
as a 'MetAlert' discovery platform for drivers and inhibitors of metastasis.

Aerosols have a potentially large effect on climate, particularly through their
interactions with clouds, but the magnitude of this effect is highly uncertain.
Large volcanic eruptions produce sulfur dioxide, which in turn produces aerosols;
these eruptions thus represent a natural experiment through which to quantify
aerosol-cloud interactions. Here we show that the massive 2014-2015 fissure
eruption in Holuhraun, Iceland, reduced the size of liquid cloud
droplets-consistent with expectations-but had no discernible effect on other
cloud properties. The reduction in droplet size led to cloud brightening and
global-mean radiative forcing of around -0.2 watts per square metre for September
to October 2014. Changes in cloud amount or cloud liquid water path, however,
were undetectable, indicating that these indirect effects, and cloud systems in
general, are well buffered against aerosol changes. This result will reduce
uncertainties in future climate projections, because we are now able to reject
results from climate models with an excessive liquid-water-path response.

BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a potent tumour suppressor gene that
modulates environmental carcinogenesis. All carriers of inherited heterozygous
germline BAP1-inactivating mutations (BAP1+/-) developed one and often several
BAP1-/- malignancies in their lifetime, mostly malignant mesothelioma, uveal
melanoma, and so on. Moreover, BAP1-acquired biallelic mutations are frequent in 
human cancers. BAP1 tumour suppressor activity has been attributed to its nuclear
localization, where it helps to maintain genome integrity. The possible activity 
of BAP1 in the cytoplasm is unknown. Cells with reduced levels of BAP1 exhibit
chromosomal abnormalities and decreased DNA repair by homologous recombination,
indicating that BAP1 dosage is critical. Cells with extensive DNA damage should
die and not grow into malignancies. Here we discover that BAP1 localizes at the
endoplasmic reticulum. Here, it binds, deubiquitylates, and stabilizes type 3
inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R3), modulating calcium (Ca2+) release 
from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and mitochondria, promoting
apoptosis. Reduced levels of BAP1 in BAP1+/- carriers cause reduction both of
IP3R3 levels and of Ca2+ flux, preventing BAP1+/- cells that accumulate DNA
damage from executing apoptosis. A higher fraction of cells exposed to either
ionizing or ultraviolet radiation, or to asbestos, survive genotoxic stress,
resulting in a higher rate of cellular transformation. We propose that the high
incidence of cancers in BAP1+/- carriers results from the combined reduced
nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of BAP1. Our data provide a mechanistic
rationale for the powerful ability of BAP1 to regulate gene-environment
interaction in human carcinogenesis.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an incurable autoimmune disease
characterized by autoantibody deposition in tissues such as kidney, skin and
lungs. Notably, up to 75% of patients with SLE experience neuropsychiatric
symptoms that range from anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment to seizures
and, in rare cases, psychosis-collectively this is referred to as central nervous
system (CNS) lupus. In some cases, certain autoantibodies, such as anti-NMDAR or 
anti-phospholipid antibodies, promote CNS lupus. However, in most patients, the
mechanisms that underlie these symptoms are unknown. CNS lupus typically presents
at lupus diagnosis or within the first year, suggesting that early factors
contributing to peripheral autoimmunity may promote CNS lupus symptoms. Here we
report behavioural phenotypes and synapse loss in lupus-prone mice that are
prevented by blocking type I interferon (IFN) signalling. Furthermore, we show
that type I IFN stimulates microglia to become reactive and engulf neuronal and
synaptic material in lupus-prone mice. These findings and our observation of
increased type I IFN signalling in post-mortem hippocampal brain sections from
patients with SLE may instruct the evaluation of ongoing clinical trials of
anifrolumab, a type I IFN-receptor antagonist. Moreover, identification of
IFN-driven microglia-dependent synapse loss, along with microglia transcriptome
data, connects CNS lupus with other CNS diseases and provides an explanation for 
the neurological symptoms observed in some patients with SLE.

In response to environmental cues that promote IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)
generation, IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the endoplasmic reticulum allow the 
'quasisynaptical' feeding of calcium to the mitochondria to promote oxidative
phosphorylation. However, persistent Ca2+ release results in mitochondrial Ca2+
overload and consequent apoptosis. Among the three mammalian IP3Rs, IP3R3 appears
to be the major player in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the F-box
protein FBXL2 (the receptor subunit of one of 69 human SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box
protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes) binds IP3R3 and targets it for ubiquitin-,
p97- and proteasome-mediated degradation to limit Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. 
FBXL2-knockdown cells and FBXL2-insensitive IP3R3 mutant knock-in clones display 
increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and sensitization
to Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) 
gene is frequently mutated or lost in human tumours and syndromes that predispose
individuals to cancer. We found that PTEN competes with FBXL2 for IP3R3 binding, 
and the FBXL2-dependent degradation of IP3R3 is accelerated in Pten-/- mouse
embryonic fibroblasts and PTEN-null cancer cells. Reconstitution of PTEN-null
cells with either wild-type PTEN or a catalytically dead mutant stabilizes IP3R3 
and induces persistent Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis. IP3R3 and PTEN protein
levels directly correlate in human prostate cancer. Both in cell culture and
xenograft models, a non-degradable IP3R3 mutant sensitizes tumour cells with low 
or no PTEN expression to photodynamic therapy, which is based on the ability of
photosensitizer drugs to cause Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity after irradiation with
visible light. Similarly, disruption of FBXL2 localization with GGTi-2418, a
geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, sensitizes xenotransplanted tumours to
photodynamic therapy. In summary, we identify a novel molecular mechanism that
limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to prevent cell death. Notably, we provide
proof-of-principle that inhibiting IP3R3 degradation in PTEN-deregulated cancers 
represents a valid therapeutic strategy.

Conventional two-dimensional differentiation from pluripotency fails to
recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. Three-dimensional 
organoids generate complex organ-like tissues; however, it is unclear how
heterotypic interactions affect lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA
sequencing to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency
in two-dimensional culture. We then derive three-dimensional liver bud organoids 
by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct
heterogeneity during liver bud development. We find that liver bud hepatoblasts
diverge from the two-dimensional lineage, and express epithelial migration
signatures characteristic of organ budding. We benchmark three-dimensional liver 
buds against fetal and adult human liver single-cell RNA sequencing data, and
find a striking correspondence between the three-dimensional liver bud and fetal 
liver cells. We use a receptor-ligand pairing analysis and a high-throughput
inhibitor assay to interrogate signalling in liver buds, and show that vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) crosstalk potentiates endothelial network
formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Our molecular dissection reveals
interlineage communication regulating organoid development, and illuminates
previously inaccessible aspects of human liver development.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC)
affect 150 million people annually. Despite effective antibiotic therapy, 30-50% 
of patients experience recurrent UTIs. In addition, the growing prevalence of
UPEC that are resistant to last-line antibiotic treatments, and more recently to 
carbapenems and colistin, make UTI a prime example of the antibiotic-resistance
crisis and emphasize the need for new approaches to treat and prevent bacterial
infections. UPEC strains establish reservoirs in the gut from which they are shed
in the faeces, and can colonize the periurethral area or vagina and subsequently 
ascend through the urethra to the urinary tract, where they cause UTIs. UPEC
isolates encode up to 16 distinct chaperone-usher pathway pili, and each pilus
type may enable colonization of a habitat in the host or environment. For
example, the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH binds mannose on the bladder surface, and 
mediates colonization of the bladder. However, little is known about the
mechanisms underlying UPEC persistence in the gut. Here, using a mouse model, we 
show that F17-like and type 1 pili promote intestinal colonization and show
distinct binding to epithelial cells distributed along colonic crypts.
Phylogenomic and structural analyses reveal that F17-like pili are closely
related to pilus types carried by intestinal pathogens, but are restricted to
extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Moreover, we show that targeting FimH with
M4284, a high-affinity inhibitory mannoside, reduces intestinal colonization of
genetically diverse UPEC isolates, while simultaneously treating UTI, without
notably disrupting the structural configuration of the gut microbiota. By
selectively depleting intestinal UPEC reservoirs, mannosides could markedly
reduce the rate of UTIs and recurrent UTIs.

Brown adipose tissue is a thermogenic organ that dissipates chemical energy as
heat to protect animals against hypothermia and to counteract metabolic disease. 
However, the transcriptional mechanisms that determine the thermogenic capacity
of brown adipose tissue before environmental cold are unknown. Here we show that 
histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is required to activate brown adipose tissue
enhancers to ensure thermogenic aptitude. Mice with brown adipose tissue-specific
genetic ablation of HDAC3 become severely hypothermic and succumb to acute cold
exposure. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is nearly absent in brown adipose tissue
lacking HDAC3, and there is also marked downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation genes resulting in diminished mitochondrial respiration.
Remarkably, although HDAC3 acts canonically as a transcriptional corepressor, it 
functions as a coactivator of oestrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) in brown
adipose tissue. HDAC3 coactivation of ERRα is mediated by deacetylation of PGC-1α
and is required for the transcription of Ucp1, Ppargc1a (encoding PGC-1α), and
oxidative phosphorylation genes. Importantly, HDAC3 promotes the basal
transcription of these genes independently of adrenergic stimulation. Thus, HDAC3
uniquely primes Ucp1 and the thermogenic transcriptional program to maintain a
critical capacity for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue that can be rapidly
engaged upon exposure to dangerously cold temperature.

Self-motion triggers complementary visual and vestibular reflexes supporting
image-stabilization and balance. Translation through space produces one global
pattern of retinal image motion (optic flow), rotation another. We examined the
direction preferences of direction-sensitive ganglion cells (DSGCs) in flattened 
mouse retinas in vitro. Here we show that for each subtype of DSGC, direction
preference varies topographically so as to align with specific translatory optic 
flow fields, creating a neural ensemble tuned for a specific direction of motion 
through space. Four cardinal translatory directions are represented, aligned with
two axes of high adaptive relevance: the body and gravitational axes. One subtype
maximizes its output when the mouse advances, others when it retreats, rises or
falls. Two classes of DSGCs, namely, ON-DSGCs and ON-OFF-DSGCs, share the same
spatial geometry but weight the four channels differently. Each subtype ensemble 
is also tuned for rotation. The relative activation of DSGC channels uniquely
encodes every translation and rotation. Although retinal and vestibular systems
both encode translatory and rotatory self-motion, their coordinate systems
differ.

The mutant form of the GTPase KRAS is a key driver of pancreatic cancer but
remains a challenging therapeutic target. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles
generated by all cells, and are naturally present in the blood. Here we show that
enhanced retention of exosomes, compared to liposomes, in the circulation of mice
is likely due to CD47-mediated protection of exosomes from phagocytosis by
monocytes and macrophages. Exosomes derived from normal fibroblast-like
mesenchymal cells were engineered to carry short interfering RNA or short hairpin
RNA specific to oncogenic KrasG12D, a common mutation in pancreatic cancer.
Compared to liposomes, the engineered exosomes (known as iExosomes) target
oncogenic KRAS with an enhanced efficacy that is dependent on CD47, and is
facilitated by macropinocytosis. Treatment with iExosomes suppressed cancer in
multiple mouse models of pancreatic cancer and significantly increased overall
survival. Our results demonstrate an approach for direct and specific targeting
of oncogenic KRAS in tumours using iExosomes.

Complete and accurate reference genomes and annotations provide fundamental tools
for characterization of genetic and functional variation. These resources
facilitate the determination of biological processes and support translation of
research findings into improved and sustainable agricultural technologies. Many
reference genomes for crop plants have been generated over the past decade, but
these genomes are often fragmented and missing complex repeat regions. Here we
report the assembly and annotation of a reference genome of maize, a genetic and 
agricultural model species, using single-molecule real-time sequencing and
high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our
assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and notable improvements in
the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the
repetitive portion of the genome revealed more than 130,000 intact transposable
elements, allowing us to identify transposable element lineage expansions that
are unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length
transcripts obtained by single-molecule real-time sequencing. In addition,
comparative optical mapping of two other inbred maize lines revealed a prevalence
of deletions in regions of low gene density and maize lineage-specific genes.

The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extrasolar planets now known, only six have been found that transit hot, A-type
stars (with temperatures of 7,300-10,000 kelvin), and no planets are known to
transit the even hotter B-type stars. For example, WASP-33 is an A-type star with
a temperature of about 7,430 kelvin, which hosts the hottest known transiting
planet, WASP-33b (ref. 1); the planet is itself as hot as a red dwarf star of
type M (ref. 2). WASP-33b displays a large heat differential between its dayside 
and nightside, and is highly inflated-traits that have been linked to high
insolation. However, even at the temperature of its dayside, its atmosphere
probably resembles the molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets and, given
the level of ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely
to be substantially ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689 (also known as KELT-9), which reveal a 
close-in (orbital period of about 1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At
approximately 10,170 kelvin, the host star is at the dividing line between stars 
of type A and B, and we measure the dayside temperature of KELT-9b to be about
4,600 kelvin. This is as hot as stars of stellar type K4 (ref. 5). The molecules 
in K stars are entirely dissociated, and so the primary sources of opacity in the
dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b are probably atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b
receives 700 times more extreme-ultraviolet radiation (that is, with wavelengths 
shorter than 91.2 nanometres) than WASP-33b, leading to a predicted range of
mass-loss rates that could leave the planet largely stripped of its envelope
during the main-sequence lifetime of the host star.

Cpf1 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that is emerging as a powerful genome-editing 
tool. Here we provide insight into its DNA-targeting mechanism by determining the
structure of Francisella novicida Cpf1 with the triple-stranded R-loop generated 
after DNA cleavage. The structure reveals the machinery involved in DNA unwinding
to form a CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-DNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand. The
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain. The
loop-lysine helix-loop motif in this domain contains three conserved lysine
residues that are inserted in a dentate manner into the double-stranded DNA.
Unzipping of the double-stranded DNA occurs in a cleft arranged by acidic and
hydrophobic residues facilitating the crRNA-DNA hybrid formation. The PAM
single-stranded DNA is funnelled towards the nuclease site through a mixed
hydrophobic and basic cavity. In this catalytic conformation, the PAM-interacting
domain and the helix-loop-helix motif in the REC1 domain adopt a 'rail' shape and
'flap-on' conformations, respectively, channelling the PAM strand into the
cavity. A steric barrier between the RuvC-II and REC1 domains forms the 'septum',
separating the displaced PAM strand and the crRNA-DNA hybrid, avoiding DNA
re-annealing. Mutations in key residues reveal a mechanism linking the PAM and
DNA nuclease sites. Analysis of the Cpf1 structures proposes a singular working
model of RNA-guided DNA cleavage, suggesting new avenues for redesign of Cpf1.

ABCG2 is a constitutively expressed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that
protects many tissues against xenobiotic molecules. Its activity affects the
pharmacokinetics of commonly used drugs and limits the delivery of therapeutics
into tumour cells, thus contributing to multidrug resistance. Here we present the
structure of human ABCG2 determined by cryo-electron microscopy, providing the
first high-resolution insight into a human multidrug transporter. We visualize
ABCG2 in complex with two antigen-binding fragments of the human-specific,
inhibitory antibody 5D3 that recognizes extracellular loops of the transporter.
We observe two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that
is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between
the transmembrane domains. Combined with functional in vitro analyses, our
results suggest a multidrug recognition and transport mechanism of ABCG2,
rationalize disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms and the allosteric
inhibition by the 5D3 antibody, and provide the structural basis of cholesterol
recognition by other G-subfamily ABC transporters.

At redshift z = 2, when the Universe was just three billion years old, half of
the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted their 
fuel for star formation. It is believed that they were formed in intense nuclear 
starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive local elliptical
galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor companions, but validating this
picture requires higher-resolution observations of their centres than is
currently possible. Magnification from gravitational lensing offers an
opportunity to resolve the inner regions of galaxies. Here we report an analysis 
of the stellar populations and kinematics of a lensed z = 2.1478 compact galaxy, 
which-surprisingly-turns out to be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk
galaxy. Its stars must have formed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven
nuclear starburst. The galaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were
able to penetrate the hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from 
the dark matter halo. This result confirms previous indirect indications that the
first galaxies to cease star formation must have gone through major changes not
just in their structure, but also in their kinematics, to evolve into present-day
elliptical galaxies.

The interplay between magnetic fields and interacting particles can lead to
exotic phases of matter that exhibit topological order and high degrees of
spatial entanglement. Although these phases were discovered in a solid-state
setting, recent innovations in systems of ultracold neutral atoms-uncharged atoms
that do not naturally experience a Lorentz force-allow the synthesis of
artificial magnetic, or gauge, fields. This experimental platform holds promise
for exploring exotic physics in fractional quantum Hall systems, owing to the
microscopic control and precision that is achievable in cold-atom systems.
However, so far these experiments have mostly explored the regime of weak
interactions, which precludes access to correlated many-body states. Here,
through microscopic atomic control and detection, we demonstrate the controlled
incorporation of strong interactions into a two-body system with a chiral band
structure. We observe and explain the way in which interparticle interactions
induce chirality in the propagation dynamics of particles in a ladder-like,
real-space lattice governed by the interacting Harper-Hofstadter model, which
describes lattice-confined, coherently mobile particles in the presence of a
magnetic field. We use a bottom-up strategy to prepare interacting chiral quantum
states, thus circumventing the challenges of a top-down approach that begins with
a many-body system, the size of which can hinder the preparation of controlled
states. Our experimental platform combines all of the necessary components for
investigating highly entangled topological states, and our observations provide a
benchmark for future experiments in the fractional quantum Hall regime.

D-type cyclins (D1, D2 and D3) and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDK4 and CDK6) are components of the core cell cycle machinery that drives cell 
proliferation. Inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 are currently being tested in clinical
trials for patients with several cancer types, with promising results. Here,
using human cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts in mice, we show that the
cyclin D3-CDK6 kinase phosphorylates and inhibits the catalytic activity of two
key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, 6-phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase 
M2. This re-directs the glycolytic intermediates into the pentose phosphate (PPP)
and serine pathways. Inhibition of cyclin D3-CDK6 in tumour cells reduces flow
through the PPP and serine pathways, thereby depleting the antioxidants NADPH and
glutathione. This, in turn, increases the levels of reactive oxygen species and
causes apoptosis of tumour cells. The pro-survival function of cyclin
D-associated kinase operates in tumours expressing high levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 
complexes. We propose that measuring the levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 in human
cancers might help to identify tumour subsets that undergo cell death and tumour 
regression upon inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. Cyclin D3-CDK6, through its ability 
to link cell cycle and cell metabolism, represents a particularly powerful
oncoprotein that affects cancer cells at several levels, and this property can be
exploited for anti-cancer therapy.

Adaptive immune responses are tailored to different types of pathogens through
differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into functionally distinct subsets of
effector T cells (T helper 1 (TH1), TH2, and TH17) defined by expression of the
key transcription factors T-bet, GATA3, and RORγt, respectively. Regulatory T
(Treg) cells comprise a distinct anti-inflammatory lineage specified by the
X-linked transcription factor Foxp3 (refs 2, 3). Paradoxically, some activated
Treg cells express the aforementioned effector CD4 T cell transcription factors, 
which have been suggested to provide Treg cells with enhanced suppressive
capacity. Whether expression of these factors in Treg cells-as in effector T
cells-is indicative of heterogeneity of functionally discrete and stable
differentiation states, or conversely may be readily reversible, is unknown. Here
we demonstrate that expression of the TH1-associated transcription factor T-bet
in mouse Treg cells, induced at steady state and following infection, gradually
becomes highly stable even under non-permissive conditions. Loss of function or
elimination of T-bet-expressing Treg cells-but not of T-bet expression in Treg
cells-resulted in severe TH1 autoimmunity. Conversely, following depletion of
T-bet- Treg cells, the remaining T-bet+ cells specifically inhibited TH1 and CD8 
T cell activation consistent with their co-localization with T-bet+ effector T
cells. These results suggest that T-bet+ Treg cells have an essential
immunosuppressive function and indicate that Treg cell functional heterogeneity
is a critical feature of immunological tolerance.

Therapies that target signalling molecules that are mutated in cancers can often 
have substantial short-term effects, but the emergence of resistant cancer cells 
is a major barrier to full cures. Resistance can result from secondary mutations,
but in other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the possibility of
non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show that human melanoma cells can
display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that
predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability
involves infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance
markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug 
then induces epigenetic reprogramming in these cells, converting the transient
transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with
a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signalling
pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the transcription factors JUN
and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition
of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics
in single cells. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression
of many of these same marker genes, suggesting the existence of a general program
in which expression is displayed in rare subpopulations of cells.

Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs), the precursors of sperm and eggs, originate 
during weeks 2-3 of early post-implantation development. Using in vitro models of
hPGC induction, recent studies have suggested that there are marked mechanistic
differences in the specification of human and mouse PGCs. This may be due in part
to the divergence in their pluripotency networks and early post-implantation
development. As early human embryos are not accessible for direct study, we
considered alternatives including porcine embryos that, as in humans, develop as 
bilaminar embryonic discs. Here we show that porcine PGCs originate from the
posterior pre-primitive-streak competent epiblast by sequential upregulation of
SOX17 and BLIMP1 in response to WNT and BMP signalling. We use this model
together with human and monkey in vitro models simulating peri-gastrulation
development to show the conserved principles of epiblast development for
competency for primordial germ cell fate. This process is followed by initiation 
of the epigenetic program and regulated by a balanced SOX17-BLIMP1 gene dosage.
Our combinatorial approach using human, porcine and monkey in vivo and in vitro
models provides synthetic insights into early human development.

Metabolic production of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is linked to histone
acetylation and gene regulation, but the precise mechanisms of this process are
largely unknown. Here we show that the metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase 2
(ACSS2) directly regulates histone acetylation in neurons and spatial memory in
mammals. In a neuronal cell culture model, ACSS2 increases in the nuclei of
differentiating neurons and localizes to upregulated neuronal genes near sites of
elevated histone acetylation. A decrease in ACSS2 lowers nuclear acetyl-CoA
levels, histone acetylation, and responsive expression of the cohort of neuronal 
genes. In adult mice, attenuation of hippocampal ACSS2 expression impairs
long-term spatial memory, a cognitive process that relies on histone acetylation.
A decrease in ACSS2 in the hippocampus also leads to defective upregulation of
memory-related neuronal genes that are pre-bound by ACSS2. These results reveal a
connection between cellular metabolism, gene regulation, and neural plasticity
and establish a link between acetyl-CoA generation 'on-site' at chromatin for
histone acetylation and the transcription of key neuronal genes.

Diarrhoeal disease is responsible for 8.6% of global child mortality. Recent
epidemiological studies found the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium to be a
leading cause of paediatric diarrhoea, with particularly grave impact on infants 
and immunocompromised individuals. There is neither a vaccine nor an effective
treatment. Here we establish a drug discovery process built on scalable
phenotypic assays and mouse models that take advantage of transgenic parasites.
Screening a library of compounds with anti-parasitic activity, we identify
pyrazolopyridines as inhibitors of Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium
hominis. Oral treatment with the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 results in a potent
reduction in intestinal infection of immunocompromised mice. Treatment also leads
to rapid resolution of diarrhoea and dehydration in neonatal calves, a clinical
model of cryptosporidiosis that closely resembles human infection. Our results
suggest that the Cryptosporidium lipid kinase PI(4)K (phosphatidylinositol-4-OH
kinase) is a target for pyrazolopyridines and that KDU731 warrants further
preclinical evaluation as a drug candidate for the treatment of
cryptosporidiosis.

Although the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas and its link to
birth defects have attracted a great deal of attention, much remains unknown
about ZIKV disease epidemiology and ZIKV evolution, in part owing to a lack of
genomic data. Here we address this gap in knowledge by using multiple sequencing 
approaches to generate 110 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from
10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic
diversity from this outbreak. We analysed the timing and patterns of
introductions into distinct geographic regions; our phylogenetic evidence
suggests rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil and multiple introductions of 
outbreak strains into Puerto Rico, Honduras, Colombia, other Caribbean islands,
and the continental United States. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in
multiple regions for many months before the first locally transmitted cases were 
confirmed, highlighting the importance of surveillance of viral infections. We
identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and
pathogenesis, as well as those that might be relevant to the effectiveness of
diagnostic tests.

Transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas was first confirmed in May 2015
in northeast Brazil. Brazil has had the highest number of reported ZIKV cases
worldwide (more than 200,000 by 24 December 2016) and the most cases associated
with microcephaly and other birth defects (2,366 confirmed by 31 December 2016). 
Since the initial detection of ZIKV in Brazil, more than 45 countries in the
Americas have reported local ZIKV transmission, with 24 of these reporting severe
ZIKV-associated disease. However, the origin and epidemic history of ZIKV in
Brazil and the Americas remain poorly understood, despite the value of this
information for interpreting observed trends in reported microcephaly. Here we
address this issue by generating 54 complete or partial ZIKV genomes, mostly from
Brazil, and reporting data generated by a mobile genomics laboratory that
travelled across northeast Brazil in 2016. One sequence represents the earliest
confirmed ZIKV infection in Brazil. Analyses of viral genomes with ecological and
epidemiological data yield an estimate that ZIKV was present in northeast Brazil 
by February 2014 and is likely to have disseminated from there, nationally and
internationally, before the first detection of ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated
dates for the international spread of ZIKV from Brazil indicate the duration of
pre-detection cryptic transmission in recipient regions. The role of northeast
Brazil in the establishment of ZIKV in the Americas is further supported by
geographic analysis of ZIKV transmission potential and by estimates of the basic 
reproduction number of the virus.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is causing an unprecedented epidemic linked to severe
congenital abnormalities. In July 2016, mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission was
reported in the continental United States; since then, hundreds of locally
acquired infections have been reported in Florida. To gain insights into the
timing, source, and likely route(s) of ZIKV introduction, we tracked the virus
from its first detection in Florida by sequencing ZIKV genomes from infected
patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We show that at least 4 introductions, but
potentially as many as 40, contributed to the outbreak in Florida and that local 
transmission is likely to have started in the spring of 2016-several months
before its initial detection. By analysing surveillance and genetic data, we show
that ZIKV moved among transmission zones in Miami. Our analyses show that most
introductions were linked to the Caribbean, a finding corroborated by the high
incidence rates and traffic volumes from the region into the Miami area. Our
study provides an understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in new
regions.

Technology utilizing human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) has
enormous potential to provide improved cellular models of human disease. However,
variable genetic and phenotypic characterization of many existing iPS cell lines 
limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here we describe the
systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 711 iPS cell lines derived
from 301 healthy individuals by the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
Initiative. Our study outlines the major sources of genetic and phenotypic
variation in iPS cells and establishes their suitability as models of complex
human traits and cancer. Through genome-wide profiling we find that 5-46% of the 
variation in different iPS cell phenotypes, including differentiation capacity
and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals.
Additionally, we assess the phenotypic consequences of genomic copy-number
alterations that are repeatedly observed in iPS cells. In addition, we present a 
comprehensive map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of
human pluripotent cells.

CRISPR-Cas9 systems are bacterial adaptive immune systems that defend against
infection by phages. Through the RNA-guided endonuclease activity of Cas9 they
degrade double-stranded DNA with a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and sequences
complementary to the guide RNA. Recently, two anti-CRISPR proteins (AcrIIA2 and
AcrIIA4 from Listeria monocytogenes prophages) were identified, both of which
inhibit Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9) and L. monocytogenes Cas9 activity 
in bacteria and human cells. However, the mechanism of AcrIIA2- or
AcrIIA4-mediated Cas9 inhibition remains unknown. Here we report a crystal
structure of SpyCas9 in complex with a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and AcrIIA4. Our 
data show that AcrIIA2 and AcrIIA4 interact with SpyCas9 in a sgRNA-dependent
manner. The structure reveals that AcrIIA4 inhibits SpyCas9 activity by
structurally mimicking the PAM to occupy the PAM-interacting site in the
PAM-interacting domain, thereby blocking recognition of double-stranded DNA
substrates by SpyCas9. AcrIIA4 further inhibits the endonuclease activity of
SpyCas9 by shielding its RuvC active site. Structural comparison reveals that
formation of the AcrIIA4-binding site of SpyCas9 is induced by sgRNA binding. Our
study reveals the mechanism of SpyCas9 inhibition by AcrIIA4, providing a
structural basis for developing 'off-switch' tools for SpyCas9 to avoid unwanted 
genome edits within cells and tissues.

Adhesion strategies that rely on mechanical interlocking or molecular attractions
between surfaces can suffer when coming into contact with liquids. Thus far,
artificial wet and dry adhesives have included hierarchical mushroom-shaped or
porous structures that allow suction or capillarity, supramolecular structures
comprising nanoparticles, and chemistry-based attractants that use various
protein polyelectrolytes. However, it is challenging to develop adhesives that
are simple to make and also perform well-and repeatedly-under both wet and dry
conditions, while avoiding non-chemical contamination on the adhered surfaces.
Here we present an artificial, biologically inspired, reversible wet/dry adhesion
system that is based on the dome-like protuberances found in the suction cups of 
octopi. To mimic the architecture of these protuberances, we use a simple,
solution-based, air-trap technique that involves fabricating a patterned
structure as a polymeric master, and using it to produce a reversed architecture,
without any sophisticated chemical syntheses or surface modifications. The
micrometre-scale domes in our artificial adhesive enhance the suction stress.
This octopus-inspired system exhibits strong, reversible, highly repeatable
adhesion to silicon wafers, glass, and rough skin surfaces under various
conditions (dry, moist, under water and under oil). To demonstrate a potential
application, we also used our adhesive to transport a large silicon wafer in air 
and under water without any resulting surface contamination.

More than a hundred hydropower dams have already been built in the Amazon basin
and numerous proposals for further dam constructions are under consideration. The
accumulated negative environmental effects of existing dams and proposed dams, if
constructed, will trigger massive hydrophysical and biotic disturbances that will
affect the Amazon basin's floodplains, estuary and sediment plume. We introduce a
Dam Environmental Vulnerability Index to quantify the current and potential
impacts of dams in the basin. The scale of foreseeable environmental degradation 
indicates the need for collective action among nations and states to avoid
cumulative, far-reaching impacts. We suggest institutional innovations to assess 
and avoid the likely impoverishment of Amazon rivers.

Considerable progress in wireless power transfer has been made in the realm of
non-radiative transfer, which employs magnetic-field coupling in the near field. 
A combination of circuit resonance and impedance transformation is often used to 
help to achieve efficient transfer of power over a predetermined distance of
about the size of the resonators. The development of non-radiative wireless power
transfer has paved the way towards real-world applications such as wireless
powering of implantable medical devices and wireless charging of stationary
electric vehicles. However, it remains a fundamental challenge to create a
wireless power transfer system in which the transfer efficiency is robust against
the variation of operating conditions. Here we propose theoretically and
demonstrate experimentally that a parity-time-symmetric circuit incorporating a
nonlinear gain saturation element provides robust wireless power transfer. Our
results show that the transfer efficiency remains near unity over a distance
variation of approximately one metre, without the need for any tuning. This is in
contrast with conventional methods where high transfer efficiency can only be
maintained by constantly tuning the frequency or the internal coupling parameters
as the transfer distance or the relative orientation of the source and receiver
units is varied. The use of a nonlinear parity-time-symmetric circuit should
enable robust wireless power transfer to moving devices or vehicles.

Despite more than 50 years of investigation, it is still unclear how the
underlying structure of relaxor ferroelectrics gives rise to their defining
properties, such as ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficients, high permittivity over 
a broad temperature range, diffuse phase transitions, strong frequency dependence
in dielectric response, and phonon anomalies. The model of polar nanoregions
inside a non-polar matrix has been widely used to describe the structure of
relaxor ferroelectrics. However, the lack of precise knowledge about the shapes, 
growth and dipole patterns of polar nanoregions has led to the characterization
of relaxors as "hopeless messes", and no predictive model for relaxor behaviour
is currently available. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations of the
prototypical Pb(Mg1/3,Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 relaxor material to examine its structure
and the spatial and temporal polarization correlations. Our simulations show that
the unusual properties of relaxors stem from the presence of a multi-domain state
with extremely small domain sizes (2-10 nanometres), and no non-polar matrix,
owing to the local dynamics. We find that polar structures in the multi-domain
state in relaxors are analogous to those of the slush state of water. The
multi-domain structure of relaxors that is revealed by our molecular dynamics
simulations is consistent with recent experimental diffuse scattering results and
indicates that relaxors have a high density of low-angle domain walls. This
insight explains the recently discovered classes of relaxors that cannot be
described by the polar nanoregion model, and provides guidance for the design and
synthesis of new relaxor materials.

Two distinct forms of natural selection promote adaptive biological diversity.
Divergent selection occurs when different environments favour different
phenotypes, leading to increased differences between populations. Negative
frequency-dependent selection occurs when rare variants within a population are
favoured over common ones, increasing diversity within populations. These two
diversifying forces promote genetic variation at different spatial scales, and
may act in opposition, but their relative effects remain unclear because they are
rarely measured concurrently. Here we show that negative frequency-dependent
selection within populations can favor rare immigrants over locally adapted
residents. We reciprocally transplanted lake and stream ecotypes of threespine
stickleback into lake and stream habitats, while manipulating the relative
abundance of residents versus immigrants. We found negative frequency-dependence:
survival was highest for the locally rare ecotype, rather than natives. Also,
individuals with locally rare major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIb
genotypes were infected by fewer parasites. This negative frequency-dependent
selection will tend to favour rare immigrants over common residents, amplifying
the effect of migration and undermining the efficacy of divergent natural
selection to drive population differences. The only signal of divergent selection
was a tendency for foreign fish to have higher parasite loads than residents,
after controlling for MHC genotype rarity. Frequency-dependent ecological
interactions have long been thought to promote speciation. Our results suggest a 
more nuanced view in which negative frequency dependence alters the fate of
migrants to promote or constrain evolutionary divergence between populations.

Adult pair bonding involves dramatic changes in the perception and valuation of
another individual. One key change is that partners come to reliably activate the
brain's reward system, although the precise neural mechanisms by which partners
become rewarding during sociosexual interactions leading to a bond remain
unclear. Here we show, using a prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) model of
social bonding, how a functional circuit from the medial prefrontal cortex to
nucleus accumbens is dynamically modulated to enhance females' affiliative
behaviour towards a partner. Individual variation in the strength of this
functional connectivity, particularly after the first mating encounter, predicts 
how quickly animals begin affiliative huddling with their partner. Rhythmically
activating this circuit in a social context without mating biases later
preference towards a partner, indicating that this circuit's activity is not just
correlated with how quickly animals become affiliative but causally accelerates
it. These results provide the first dynamic view of corticostriatal activity
during bond formation, revealing how social interactions can recruit brain reward
systems to drive changes in affiliative behaviour.

As key executers of biological functions, the activity and abundance of proteins 
are subjected to extensive regulation. Deciphering the genetic architecture
underlying this regulation is critical for understanding cellular signalling
events and responses to environmental cues. Using random mutagenesis in haploid
human cells, we apply a sensitive approach to directly couple genomic mutations
to protein measurements in individual cells. Here we use this to examine a suite 
of cellular processes, such as transcriptional induction, regulation of protein
abundance and splicing, signalling cascades (mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), protein kinase B (AKT), interferon,
and Wingless and Int-related protein (WNT) pathways) and epigenetic modifications
(histone crotonylation and methylation). This scalable, sequencing-based
procedure elucidates the genetic landscapes that control protein states,
identifying genes that cause very narrow phenotypic effects and genes that lead
to broad phenotypic consequences. The resulting genetic wiring map identifies the
E3-ligase substrate adaptor KCTD5 (ref. 1) as a negative regulator of the AKT
pathway, a key signalling cascade frequently deregulated in cancer.
KCTD5-deficient cells show elevated levels of phospho-AKT at S473 that could not 
be attributed to effects on canonical pathway components. To reveal the genetic
requirements for this phenotype, we iteratively analysed the regulatory network
linked to AKT activity in the knockout background. This genetic modifier screen
exposes suppressors of the KCTD5 phenotype and mechanistically demonstrates that 
KCTD5 acts as an off-switch for GPCR signalling by triggering proteolysis of Gβγ 
heterodimers dissociated from the Gα subunit. Although biological networks have
previously been constructed on the basis of gene expression, protein-protein
associations, or genetic interaction profiles, we foresee that the approach
described here will enable the generation of a comprehensive genetic wiring map
for human cells on the basis of quantitative protein states.

Expansions of short nucleotide repeats produce several neurological and
neuromuscular disorders including Huntington disease, muscular dystrophy, and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A common pathological feature of these diseases is
the accumulation of the repeat-containing transcripts into aberrant foci in the
nucleus. RNA foci, as well as the disease symptoms, only manifest above a
critical number of nucleotide repeats, but the molecular mechanism governing foci
formation above this characteristic threshold remains unresolved. Here we show
that repeat expansions create templates for multivalent base-pairing, which
causes purified RNA to undergo a sol-gel transition in vitro at a similar
critical repeat number as observed in the diseases. In human cells, RNA foci form
by phase separation of the repeat-containing RNA and can be dissolved by agents
that disrupt RNA gelation in vitro. Analogous to protein aggregation disorders,
our results suggest that the sequence-specific gelation of RNAs could be a
contributing factor to neurological disease.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) regulates glucose homeostasis through the control
of insulin release from the pancreas. GLP-1 peptide agonists are efficacious
drugs for the treatment of diabetes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism
of action of GLP-1 peptides, here we report the crystal structure of the
full-length GLP-1 receptor bound to a truncated peptide agonist. The peptide
agonist retains an α-helical conformation as it sits deep within the
receptor-binding pocket. The arrangement of the transmembrane helices reveals
hallmarks of an active conformation similar to that observed in class A
receptors. Guided by this structural information, we design peptide agonists with
potent in vivo activity in a mouse model of diabetes.

Similar to resting mature B cells, where the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)
controls cellular survival, surface BCR expression is conserved in most mature
B-cell lymphomas. The identification of activating BCR mutations and the growth
disadvantage upon BCR knockdown of cells of certain lymphoma entities has led to 
the view that BCR signalling is required for tumour cell survival. Consequently, 
the BCR signalling machinery has become an established target in the therapy of
B-cell malignancies. Here we study the effects of BCR ablation on MYC-driven
mouse B-cell lymphomas and compare them with observations in human Burkitt
lymphoma. Whereas BCR ablation does not, per se, significantly affect lymphoma
growth, BCR-negative (BCR-) tumour cells rapidly disappear in the presence of
their BCR-expressing (BCR+) counterparts in vitro and in vivo. This requires
neither cellular contact nor factors released by BCR+ tumour cells. Instead, BCR 
loss induces the rewiring of central carbon metabolism, increasing the
sensitivity of receptor-less lymphoma cells to nutrient restriction. The BCR
attenuates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) activity to support
MYC-controlled gene expression. BCR- tumour cells exhibit increased GSK3β
activity and are rescued from their competitive growth disadvantage by GSK3β
inhibition. BCR- lymphoma variants that restore competitive fitness normalize
GSK3β activity after constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, commonly
through Ras mutations. Similarly, in Burkitt lymphoma, activating RAS mutations
may propagate immunoglobulin-crippled tumour cells, which usually represent a
minority of the tumour bulk. Thus, while BCR expression enhances lymphoma cell
fitness, BCR-targeted therapies may profit from combinations with drugs targeting
BCR- tumour cells.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone with essential roles in regulating
insulin secretion, carbohydrate metabolism and appetite. GLP-1 effects are
mediated through binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals primarily through the stimulatory 
G protein Gs. Class B GPCRs are important therapeutic targets; however, our
understanding of their mechanism of action is limited by the lack of structural
information on activated and full-length receptors. Here we report the
cryo-electron microscopy structure of the peptide-activated GLP-1R-Gs complex at 
near atomic resolution. The peptide is clasped between the N-terminal domain and 
the transmembrane core of the receptor, and further stabilized by extracellular
loops. Conformational changes in the transmembrane domain result in a sharp kink 
in the middle of transmembrane helix 6, which pivots its intracellular half
outward to accommodate the α5-helix of the Ras-like domain of Gs. These results
provide a structural framework for understanding class B GPCR activation through 
hormone binding.

The human glucagon receptor, GCGR, belongs to the class B G-protein-coupled
receptor family and plays a key role in glucose homeostasis and the
pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Here we report the 3.0 Å crystal structure of
full-length GCGR containing both the extracellular domain and transmembrane
domain in an inactive conformation. The two domains are connected by a 12-residue
segment termed the stalk, which adopts a β-strand conformation, instead of
forming an α-helix as observed in the previously solved structure of the GCGR
transmembrane domain. The first extracellular loop exhibits a β-hairpin
conformation and interacts with the stalk to form a compact β-sheet structure.
Hydrogen-deuterium exchange, disulfide crosslinking and molecular dynamics
studies suggest that the stalk and the first extracellular loop have critical
roles in modulating peptide ligand binding and receptor activation. These
insights into the full-length GCGR structure deepen our understanding of the
signalling mechanisms of class B G-protein-coupled receptors.

The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR)
are members of the secretin-like class B family of G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) and have opposing physiological roles in insulin release and glucose
homeostasis. The treatment of type 2 diabetes requires positive modulation of
GLP-1R to inhibit glucagon secretion and stimulate insulin secretion in a
glucose-dependent manner. Here we report crystal structures of the human GLP-1R
transmembrane domain in complex with two different negative allosteric
modulators, PF-06372222 and NNC0640, at 2.7 and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively.
The structures reveal a common binding pocket for negative allosteric modulators,
present in both GLP-1R and GCGR and located outside helices V-VII near the
intracellular half of the receptor. The receptor is in an inactive conformation
with compounds that restrict movement of the intracellular tip of helix VI, a
movement that is generally associated with activation mechanisms in class A
GPCRs. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis studies indicate that agonist positive
allosteric modulators target the same general region, but in a distinct
sub-pocket at the interface between helices V and VI, which may facilitate the
formation of an intracellular binding site that enhances G-protein coupling.

The realization of long-range ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional van der
Waals crystals, combined with their rich electronic and optical properties, could
lead to new magnetic, magnetoelectric and magneto-optic applications. In
two-dimensional systems, the long-range magnetic order is strongly suppressed by 
thermal fluctuations, according to the Mermin-Wagner theorem; however, these
thermal fluctuations can be counteracted by magnetic anisotropy. Previous
efforts, based on defect and composition engineering, or the proximity effect,
introduced magnetic responses only locally or extrinsically. Here we report
intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 atomic layers, as 
revealed by scanning magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. In this magnetically soft,
two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, we achieve unprecedented control of
the transition temperature (between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states) using 
very small fields (smaller than 0.3 tesla). This result is in contrast to the
insensitivity of the transition temperature to magnetic fields in the
three-dimensional regime. We found that the small applied field leads to an
effective anisotropy that is much greater than the near-zero magnetocrystalline
anisotropy, opening up a large spin-wave excitation gap. We explain the observed 
phenomenon using renormalized spin-wave theory and conclude that the unusual
field dependence of the transition temperature is a hallmark of soft,
two-dimensional ferromagnetic van der Waals crystals. Cr2Ge2Te6 is a nearly ideal
two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet and so will be useful for studying
fundamental spin behaviours, opening the door to exploring new applications such 
as ultra-compact spintronics.

One of the key assumptions of the standard model of particle physics is that the 
interactions of the charged leptons, namely electrons, muons and taus, differ
only because of their different masses. Whereas precision tests comparing
processes involving electrons and muons have not revealed any definite violation 
of this assumption, recent studies of B-meson decays involving the higher-mass
tau lepton have resulted in observations that challenge lepton universality at
the level of four standard deviations. A confirmation of these results would
point to new particles or interactions, and could have profound implications for 
our understanding of particle physics.

Mammalian cells are surrounded by diverse nutrients, such as glucose, amino
acids, various macromolecules and micronutrients, which they can import through
transmembrane transporters and endolysosomal pathways. By using different
nutrient sources, cells gain metabolic flexibility to survive periods of
starvation. Quiescent cells take up sufficient nutrients to sustain homeostasis. 
However, proliferating cells depend on growth-factor-induced increases in
nutrient uptake to support biomass formation. Here, we review cellular nutrient
acquisition strategies and their regulation by growth factors and cell-intrinsic 
nutrient sensors. We also discuss how oncogenes and tumour suppressors promote
nutrient uptake and thereby support the survival and growth of cancer cells.

Since the discovery of graphene, the family of two-dimensional materials has
grown, displaying a broad range of electronic properties. Recent additions
include semiconductors with spin-valley coupling, Ising superconductors that can 
be tuned into a quantum metal, possible Mott insulators with tunable
charge-density waves, and topological semimetals with edge transport. However, no
two-dimensional crystal with intrinsic magnetism has yet been discovered; such a 
crystal would be useful in many technologies from sensing to data storage.
Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the two-dimensional isotropic
Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Magnetic
anisotropy removes this restriction, however, and enables, for instance, the
occurrence of two-dimensional Ising ferromagnetism. Here we use magneto-optical
Kerr effect microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) is
an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin orientation. Its Curie temperature of
45 kelvin is only slightly lower than that of the bulk crystal, 61 kelvin, which 
is consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our studies suggest a
layer-dependent magnetic phase, highlighting thickness-dependent physical
properties typical of van der Waals crystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays
suppressed magnetization with a metamagnetic effect, whereas in trilayer CrI3 the
interlayer ferromagnetism observed in the bulk crystal is restored. This work
creates opportunities for studying magnetism by harnessing the unusual features
of atomically thin materials, such as electrical control for realizing
magnetoelectronics, and van der Waals engineering to produce interface phenomena.

Solitons are waveforms that preserve their shape while propagating, as a result
of a balance of dispersion and nonlinearity. Soliton-based data transmission
schemes were investigated in the 1980s and showed promise as a way of overcoming 
the limitations imposed by dispersion of optical fibres. However, these
approaches were later abandoned in favour of wavelength-division multiplexing
schemes, which are easier to implement and offer improved scalability to higher
data rates. Here we show that solitons could make a comeback in optical
communications, not as a competitor but as a key element of massively parallel
wavelength-division multiplexing. Instead of encoding data on the soliton pulse
train itself, we use continuous-wave tones of the associated frequency comb as
carriers for communication. Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) (solitons that rely 
on a double balance of parametric gain and cavity loss, as well as dispersion and
nonlinearity) are generated as continuously circulating pulses in an integrated
silicon nitride microresonator via four-photon interactions mediated by the Kerr 
nonlinearity, leading to low-noise, spectrally smooth, broadband optical
frequency combs. We use two interleaved DKS frequency combs to transmit a data
stream of more than 50 terabits per second on 179 individual optical carriers
that span the entire telecommunication C and L bands (centred around infrared
telecommunication wavelengths of 1.55 micrometres). We also demonstrate coherent 
detection of a wavelength-division multiplexing data stream by using a pair of
DKS frequency combs-one as a multi-wavelength light source at the transmitter and
the other as the corresponding local oscillator at the receiver. This approach
exploits the scalability of microresonator-based DKS frequency comb sources for
massively parallel optical communications at both the transmitter and the
receiver. Our results demonstrate the potential of these sources to replace the
arrays of continuous-wave lasers that are currently used in high-speed
communications. In combination with advanced spatial multiplexing schemes and
highly integrated silicon photonic circuits, DKS frequency combs could bring
chip-scale petabit-per-second transceivers into reach.

The timing and location of the emergence of our species and of associated
behavioural changes are crucial for our understanding of human evolution. The
earliest fossil attributed to a modern form of Homo sapiens comes from eastern
Africa and is approximately 195 thousand years old, therefore the emergence of
modern human biology is commonly placed at around 200 thousand years ago. The
earliest Middle Stone Age assemblages come from eastern and southern Africa but
date much earlier. Here we report the ages, determined by thermoluminescence
dating, of fire-heated flint artefacts obtained from new excavations at the
Middle Stone Age site of Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, which are directly associated
with newly discovered remains of H. sapiens. A weighted average age places these 
Middle Stone Age artefacts and fossils at 315 ± 34 thousand years ago. Support is
obtained through the recalculated uranium series with electron spin resonance
date of 286 ± 32 thousand years ago for a tooth from the Irhoud 3 hominin
mandible. These ages are also consistent with the faunal and microfaunal
assemblages and almost double the previous age estimates for the lower part of
the deposits. The north African site of Jebel Irhoud contains one of the earliest
directly dated Middle Stone Age assemblages, and its associated human remains are
the oldest reported for H. sapiens. The emergence of our species and of the
Middle Stone Age appear to be close in time, and these data suggest a larger
scale, potentially pan-African, origin for both.

The standard model of particle physics is our best description yet of fundamental
particles and their interactions, but it is known to be incomplete. As yet
undiscovered particles and interactions might exist. One of the most powerful
ways to search for new particles is by studying processes known as
flavour-changing neutral current decays, whereby a quark changes its flavour
without altering its electric charge. One example of such a transition is the
decay of a beauty quark into a strange quark. Here we review some intriguing
anomalies in these decays, which have revealed potential cracks in the standard
model-hinting at the existence of new phenomena.

The discovery of new materials is hampered by the lack of efficient approaches to
the exploration of both the large number of possible elemental compositions for
such materials, and of the candidate structures at each composition. For example,
the discovery of inorganic extended solid structures has relied on knowledge of
crystal chemistry coupled with time-consuming materials synthesis with
systematically varied elemental ratios. Computational methods have been developed
to guide synthesis by predicting structures at specific compositions and
predicting compositions for known crystal structures, with notable successes.
However, the challenge of finding qualitatively new, experimentally realizable
compounds, with crystal structures where the unit cell and the atom positions
within it differ from known structures, remains for compositionally complex
systems. Many valuable properties arise from substitution into known crystal
structures, but materials discovery using this approach alone risks both missing 
best-in-class performance and attempting design with incomplete knowledge. Here
we report the experimental discovery of two structure types by computational
identification of the region of a complex inorganic phase field that contains
them. This is achieved by computing probe structures that capture the chemical
and structural diversity of the system and whose energies can be ranked against
combinations of currently known materials. Subsequent experimental exploration of
the lowest-energy regions of the computed phase diagram affords two materials
with previously unreported crystal structures featuring unusual structural
motifs. This approach will accelerate the systematic discovery of new materials
in complex compositional spaces by efficiently guiding synthesis and enhancing
the predictive power of the computational tools through expansion of the
knowledge base underpinning them.

Fossil evidence points to an African origin of Homo sapiens from a group called
either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis. However, the exact place and time
of emergence of H. sapiens remain obscure because the fossil record is scarce and
the chronological age of many key specimens remains uncertain. In particular, it 
is unclear whether the present day 'modern' morphology rapidly emerged
approximately 200 thousand years ago (ka) among earlier representatives of H.
sapiens or evolved gradually over the last 400 thousand years. Here we report
newly discovered human fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, and interpret the
affinities of the hominins from this site with other archaic and recent human
groups. We identified a mosaic of features including facial, mandibular and
dental morphology that aligns the Jebel Irhoud material with early or recent
anatomically modern humans and more primitive neurocranial and endocranial
morphology. In combination with an age of 315 ± 34 thousand years (as determined 
by thermoluminescence dating), this evidence makes Jebel Irhoud the oldest and
richest African Middle Stone Age hominin site that documents early stages of the 
H. sapiens clade in which key features of modern morphology were established.
Furthermore, it shows that the evolutionary processes behind the emergence of H. 
sapiens involved the whole African continent.

Materials can be transformed from one crystalline phase to another by using an
electric field to control ion transfer, in a process that can be harnessed in
applications such as batteries, smart windows and fuel cells. Increasing the
number of transferrable ion species and of accessible crystalline phases could in
principle greatly enrich material functionality. However, studies have so far
focused mainly on the evolution and control of single ionic species (for example,
oxygen, hydrogen or lithium ions). Here we describe the reversible and
non-volatile electric-field control of dual-ion (oxygen and hydrogen) phase
transformations, with associated electrochromic and magnetoelectric effects. We
show that controlling the insertion and extraction of oxygen and hydrogen ions
independently of each other can direct reversible phase transformations among
three different material phases: the perovskite SrCoO3-δ (ref. 12), the
brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 (ref. 13), and a hitherto-unexplored phase, HSrCoO2.5. By
analysing the distinct optical absorption properties of these phases, we
demonstrate selective manipulation of spectral transparency in the visible-light 
and infrared regions, revealing a dual-band electrochromic effect that could see 
application in smart windows. Moreover, the starkly different magnetic and
electric properties of the three phases-HSrCoO2.5 is a weakly ferromagnetic
insulator, SrCoO3-δ is a ferromagnetic metal, and SrCoO2.5 is an
antiferromagnetic insulator-enable an unusual form of magnetoelectric coupling,
allowing electric-field control of three different magnetic ground states. These 
findings open up opportunities for the electric-field control of multistate phase
transformations with rich functionalities.

X-ray free-electron lasers enable the investigation of the structure and dynamics
of diverse systems, including atoms, molecules, nanocrystals and single
bioparticles, under extreme conditions. Many imaging applications that target
biological systems and complex materials use hard X-ray pulses with extremely
high peak intensities (exceeding 1020 watts per square centimetre). However,
fundamental investigations have focused mainly on the individual response of
atoms and small molecules using soft X-rays with much lower intensities. Studies 
with intense X-ray pulses have shown that irradiated atoms reach a very high
degree of ionization, owing to multiphoton absorption, which in a heteronuclear
molecular system occurs predominantly locally on a heavy atom (provided that the 
absorption cross-section of the heavy atom is considerably larger than those of
its neighbours) and is followed by efficient redistribution of the induced
charge. In serial femtosecond crystallography of biological objects-an
application of X-ray free-electron lasers that greatly enhances our ability to
determine protein structure-the ionization of heavy atoms increases the local
radiation damage that is seen in the diffraction patterns of these objects and
has been suggested as a way of phasing the diffraction data. On the basis of
experiments using either soft or less-intense hard X-rays, it is thought that the
induced charge and associated radiation damage of atoms in polyatomic molecules
can be inferred from the charge that is induced in an isolated atom under
otherwise comparable irradiation conditions. Here we show that the femtosecond
response of small polyatomic molecules that contain one heavy atom to
ultra-intense (with intensities approaching 1020 watts per square centimetre),
hard (with photon energies of 8.3 kiloelectronvolts) X-ray pulses is
qualitatively different: our experimental and modelling results establish that,
under these conditions, the ionization of a molecule is considerably enhanced
compared to that of an individual heavy atom with the same absorption
cross-section. This enhancement is driven by ultrafast charge transfer within the
molecule, which refills the core holes that are created in the heavy atom,
providing further targets for inner-shell ionization and resulting in the
emission of more than 50 electrons during the X-ray pulse. Our results
demonstrate that efficient modelling of X-ray-driven processes in complex systems
at ultrahigh intensities is feasible.

Microorganisms are often studied as populations but the behaviour of single,
individual cells can have important consequences. For example, tuberculosis,
caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, requires months of
antibiotic therapy even though the bulk of the bacterial population dies rapidly.
Shorter courses lead to high rates of relapse because subpopulations of bacilli
can survive despite being genetically identical to those that are easily killed. 
In fact, mycobacteria create variability each time a cell divides, producing
daughter cells with different sizes and growth rates. The mechanism(s) that
underlie this high-frequency variation and how variability relates to survival of
the population are unknown. Here we show that mycobacteria actively create
heterogeneity. Using a fluorescent reporter and a fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS)-based transposon screen, we find that deletion of lamA, a gene of 
previously unknown function, decreases heterogeneity in the population by
decreasing asymmetric polar growth. LamA has no known homologues in other
organisms, but is highly conserved across mycobacterial species. We find that
LamA is a member of the mycobacterial division complex (the 'divisome'). It
inhibits growth at nascent new poles, creating asymmetry in polar growth. The
kinetics of killing individual cells that lack lamA are more uniform and more
rapid with rifampicin and drugs that target the cell wall. Our results show that 
mycobacteria encode a non-conserved protein that controls the pattern of cell
growth, resulting in a population that is both heterogeneous and better able to
survive antibiotic pressure.

Effective adaptive immune responses require a large repertoire of naive T cells
that migrate throughout the body, rapidly identifying almost any foreign peptide.
Because the production of T cells declines with age, naive T cells must be
long-lived. However, it remains unclear how naive T cells survive for years while
constantly travelling. The chemoattractant sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) guides T
cell circulation among secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen, lymph nodes
and Peyer's patches, where T cells search for antigens. The concentration of S1P 
is higher in circulatory fluids than in lymphoid organs, and the S1P1 receptor
(S1P1R) directs the exit of T cells from the spleen into blood, and from lymph
nodes and Peyer's patches into lymph. Here we show that S1P is essential not only
for the circulation of naive T cells, but also for their survival. Using
transgenic mouse models, we demonstrate that lymphatic endothelial cells support 
the survival of T cells by secreting S1P via the transporter SPNS2, that this S1P
signals through S1P1R on T cells, and that the requirement for S1P1R is
independent of the established role of the receptor in guiding exit from lymph
nodes. S1P signalling maintains the mitochondrial content of naive T cells,
providing cells with the energy to continue their constant migration. The S1P
signalling pathway is being targeted therapeutically to inhibit autoreactive T
cell trafficking, and these findings suggest that it may be possible
simultaneously to target autoreactive or malignant cell survival.

Research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has demonstrated links between
plant diversity and ecosystem functions such as productivity. At other trophic
levels, the plant microbiome has been shown to influence host plant fitness and
function, and host-associated microbes have been proposed to influence ecosystem 
function through their role in defining the extended phenotype of host organisms 
However, the importance of the plant microbiome for ecosystem function has not
been quantified in the context of the known importance of plant diversity and
traits. Here, using a tree biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment, we
provide strong support for the hypothesis that leaf bacterial diversity is
positively linked to ecosystem productivity, even after accounting for the role
of plant diversity. Our results also show that host species identity, functional 
identity and functional diversity are the main determinants of leaf bacterial
community structure and diversity. Our study provides evidence of a positive
correlation between plant-associated microbial diversity and terrestrial
ecosystem productivity, and a new mechanism by which models of
biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships can be improved.

Gene translation depends on accurate decoding of mRNA, the structural mechanism
of which remains poorly understood. Ribosomes decode mRNA codons by selecting
cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs delivered by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Here we
present high-resolution structural ensembles of ribosomes with cognate or
near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs delivered by EF-Tu. Both cognate and near-cognate
tRNA anticodons explore the aminoacyl-tRNA-binding site (A site) of an open 30S
subunit, while inactive EF-Tu is separated from the 50S subunit. A transient
conformation of decoding-centre nucleotide G530 stabilizes the cognate
codon-anticodon helix, initiating step-wise 'latching' of the decoding centre.
The resulting closure of the 30S subunit docks EF-Tu at the sarcin-ricin loop of 
the 50S subunit, activating EF-Tu for GTP hydrolysis and enabling accommodation
of the aminoacyl-tRNA. By contrast, near-cognate complexes fail to induce the
G530 latch, thus favouring open 30S pre-accommodation intermediates with inactive
EF-Tu. This work reveals long-sought structural differences between the
pre-accommodation of cognate and near-cognate tRNAs that elucidate the mechanism 
of accurate decoding.

Metabolic reprogramming by oncogenic signals promotes cancer initiation and
progression. The oncogene KRAS and tumour suppressor STK11, which encodes the
kinase LKB1, regulate metabolism and are frequently mutated in non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Concurrent occurrence of oncogenic KRAS and loss of LKB1
(KL) in cells specifies aggressive oncological behaviour. Here we show that human
KL cells and tumours share metabolomic signatures of perturbed nitrogen handling.
KL cells express the urea cycle enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1 (CPS1),
which produces carbamoyl phosphate in the mitochondria from ammonia and
bicarbonate, initiating nitrogen disposal. Transcription of CPS1 is suppressed by
LKB1 through AMPK, and CPS1 expression correlates inversely with LKB1 in human
NSCLC. Silencing CPS1 in KL cells induces cell death and reduces tumour growth.
Notably, cell death results from pyrimidine depletion rather than ammonia
toxicity, as CPS1 enables an unconventional pathway of nitrogen flow from ammonia
into pyrimidines. CPS1 loss reduces the pyrimidine to purine ratio, compromises
S-phase progression and induces DNA-polymerase stalling and DNA damage. Exogenous
pyrimidines reverse DNA damage and rescue growth. The data indicate that the KL
oncological genotype imposes a metabolic vulnerability related to a dependence on
a cross-compartmental pathway of pyrimidine metabolism in an aggressive subset of
NSCLC.

Many animals keep track of their angular heading over time while navigating
through their environment. However, a neural-circuit architecture for computing
heading has not been experimentally defined in any species. Here we describe a
set of clockwise- and anticlockwise-shifting neurons in the Drosophila central
complex whose wiring and physiology provide a means to rotate an angular heading 
estimate based on the fly's angular velocity. We show that each class of shifting
neurons exists in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that
suggest different roles for each subtype at the start and end of tethered-walking
turns. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the
fly's heading in the dark, and stimulation of these neurons induces predictable
shifts in the heading signal. The central features of this biological circuit are
analogous to those of computational models proposed for head-direction cells in
rodents and may shed light on how neural systems, in general, perform
integration.

Menopause is associated with bone loss and enhanced visceral adiposity. A
polyclonal antibody that targets the β-subunit of the pituitary hormone
follicle-stimulating hormone (Fsh) increases bone mass in mice. Here, we report
that this antibody sharply reduces adipose tissue in wild-type mice, phenocopying
genetic haploinsufficiency for the Fsh receptor gene Fshr. The antibody also
causes profound beiging, increases cellular mitochondrial density, activates
brown adipose tissue and enhances thermogenesis. These actions result from the
specific binding of the antibody to the β-subunit of Fsh to block its action. Our
studies uncover opportunities for simultaneously treating obesity and
osteoporosis.

The domesticated sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., is a global oil crop that has
promise for climate change adaptation, because it can maintain stable yields
across a wide variety of environmental conditions, including drought. Even
greater resilience is achievable through the mining of resistance alleles from
compatible wild sunflower relatives, including numerous extremophile species.
Here we report a high-quality reference for the sunflower genome (3.6 gigabases),
together with extensive transcriptomic data from vegetative and floral organs.
The genome mostly consists of highly similar, related sequences and required
single-molecule real-time sequencing technologies for successful assembly. Genome
analyses enabled the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Asterids, 
further establishing the existence of a whole-genome triplication at the base of 
the Asterids II clade and a sunflower-specific whole-genome duplication around 29
million years ago. An integrative approach combining quantitative genetics,
expression and diversity data permitted development of comprehensive gene
networks for two major breeding traits, flowering time and oil metabolism, and
revealed new candidate genes in these networks. We found that the genomic
architecture of flowering time has been shaped by the most recent whole-genome
duplication, which suggests that ancient paralogues can remain in the same
regulatory networks for dozens of millions of years. This genome represents a
cornerstone for future research programs aiming to exploit genetic diversity to
improve biotic and abiotic stress resistance and oil production, while also
considering agricultural constraints and human nutritional needs.

Different facets of biodiversity other than species numbers are increasingly
appreciated as critical for maintaining the function of ecosystems and their
services to humans. While new international policy and assessment processes such 
as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services (IPBES) recognize the importance of an increasingly global, quantitative
and comprehensive approach to biodiversity protection, most insights are still
focused on a single facet of biodiversity-species. Here we broaden the focus and 
provide an evaluation of how much of the world's species, functional and
phylogenetic diversity of birds and mammals is currently protected and the scope 
for improvement. We show that the large existing gaps in the coverage for each
facet of diversity could be remedied by a slight expansion of protected areas: an
additional 5% of the land has the potential to more than triple the protected
range of species or phylogenetic or functional units. Further, the same areas are
often priorities for multiple diversity facets and for both taxa. However, we
find that the choice of conservation strategy has a fundamental effect on
outcomes. It is more difficult (that is, requires more land) to maximize basic
representation of the global biodiversity pool than to maximize local diversity. 
Overall, species and phylogenetic priorities are more similar to each other than 
they are to functional priorities, and priorities for the different bird
biodiversity facets are more similar than those of mammals. Our work shows that
large gains in biodiversity protection are possible, while also highlighting the 
need to explicitly link desired conservation objectives and biodiversity metrics.
We provide a framework and quantitative tools to advance these goals for
multi-faceted biodiversity conservation.

The organization of the eukaryotic cell into discrete membrane-bound organelles
allows for the separation of incompatible biochemical processes, but the
activities of these organelles must be coordinated. For example, lipid metabolism
is distributed between the endoplasmic reticulum for lipid synthesis, lipid
droplets for storage and transport, mitochondria and peroxisomes for β-oxidation,
and lysosomes for lipid hydrolysis and recycling. It is increasingly recognized
that organelle contacts have a vital role in diverse cellular functions. However,
the spatial and temporal organization of organelles within the cell remains
poorly characterized, as fluorescence imaging approaches are limited in the
number of different labels that can be distinguished in a single image. Here we
present a systems-level analysis of the organelle interactome using a
multispectral image acquisition method that overcomes the challenge of spectral
overlap in the fluorescent protein palette. We used confocal and lattice light
sheet instrumentation and an imaging informatics pipeline of five steps to
achieve mapping of organelle numbers, volumes, speeds, positions and dynamic
inter-organelle contacts in live cells from a monkey fibroblast cell line. We
describe the frequency and locality of two-, three-, four- and five-way
interactions among six different membrane-bound organelles (endoplasmic
reticulum, Golgi, lysosome, peroxisome, mitochondria and lipid droplet) and show 
how these relationships change over time. We demonstrate that each organelle has 
a characteristic distribution and dispersion pattern in three-dimensional space
and that there is a reproducible pattern of contacts among the six organelles,
that is affected by microtubule and cell nutrient status. These live-cell
confocal and lattice light sheet spectral imaging approaches are applicable to
any cell system expressing multiple fluorescent probes, whether in normal
conditions or when cells are exposed to disturbances such as drugs, pathogens or 
stress. This methodology thus offers a powerful descriptive tool and can be used 
to develop hypotheses about cellular organization and dynamics.

The abundance of tropospheric oxidants, such as ozone (O3) and hydroxyl (OH) and 
peroxy radicals (HO2 + RO2), determines the lifetimes of reduced trace gases such
as methane and the production of particulate matter important for climate and
human health. The response of tropospheric oxidants to climate change is poorly
constrained owing to large uncertainties in the degree to which processes that
influence oxidants may change with climate and owing to a lack of palaeo-records 
with which to constrain levels of atmospheric oxidants during past climate
transitions. At present, it is thought that temperature-dependent emissions of
tropospheric O3 precursors and water vapour abundance determine the climate
response of oxidants, resulting in lower tropospheric O3 in cold climates while
HOx (= OH + HO2 + RO2) remains relatively buffered. Here we report observations
of oxygen-17 excess of nitrate (a proxy for the relative abundance of atmospheric
O3 and HOx) from a Greenland ice core over the most recent glacial-interglacial
cycle and for two Dansgaard-Oeschger events. We find that tropospheric oxidants
are sensitive to climate change with an increase in the O3/HOx ratio in cold
climates, the opposite of current expectations. We hypothesize that the observed 
increase in O3/HOx in cold climates is driven by enhanced
stratosphere-to-troposphere transport of O3, and that reactive halogen chemistry 
is also enhanced in cold climates. Reactive halogens influence the oxidative
capacity of the troposphere directly as oxidants themselves and indirectly via
their influence on O3 and HOx. The strength of stratosphere-to-troposphere
transport is largely controlled by the Brewer-Dobson circulation, which may be
enhanced in colder climates owing to a stronger meridional gradient of sea
surface temperatures, with implications for the response of tropospheric oxidants
and stratospheric thermal and mass balance. These two processes may represent
important, yet relatively unexplored, climate feedback mechanisms during major
climate transitions.

Temperature and fluid pressure conditions control rock deformation and
mineralization on geological faults, and hence the distribution of earthquakes.
Typical intraplate continental crust has hydrostatic fluid pressure and a
near-surface thermal gradient of 31 ± 15 degrees Celsius per kilometre. At
temperatures above 300-450 degrees Celsius, usually found at depths greater than 
10-15 kilometres, the intra-crystalline plasticity of quartz and feldspar
relieves stress by aseismic creep and earthquakes are infrequent. Hydrothermal
conditions control the stability of mineral phases and hence
frictional-mechanical processes associated with earthquake rupture cycles, but
there are few temperature and fluid pressure data from active plate-bounding
faults. Here we report results from a borehole drilled into the upper part of the
Alpine Fault, which is late in its cycle of stress accumulation and expected to
rupture in a magnitude 8 earthquake in the coming decades. The borehole (depth
893 metres) revealed a pore fluid pressure gradient exceeding 9 ± 1 per cent
above hydrostatic levels and an average geothermal gradient of 125 ± 55 degrees
Celsius per kilometre within the hanging wall of the fault. These extreme
hydrothermal conditions result from rapid fault movement, which transports rock
and heat from depth, and topographically driven fluid movement that concentrates 
heat into valleys. Shear heating may occur within the fault but is not required
to explain our observations. Our data and models show that highly anomalous fluid
pressure and temperature gradients in the upper part of the seismogenic zone can 
be created by positive feedbacks between processes of fault slip, rock fracturing
and alteration, and landscape development at plate-bounding faults.

Class B G-protein-coupled receptors are major targets for the treatment of
chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes and obesity. Here we report the 
structure of a full-length class B receptor, the calcitonin receptor, in complex 
with peptide ligand and heterotrimeric Gαsβγ protein determined by Volta
phase-plate single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The peptide agonist engages
the receptor by binding to an extended hydrophobic pocket facilitated by the
large outward movement of the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices 6 and
7. This conformation is accompanied by a 60° kink in helix 6 and a large outward 
movement of the intracellular end of this helix, opening the bundle to
accommodate interactions with the α5-helix of Gαs. Also observed is an extended
intracellular helix 8 that contributes to both receptor stability and functional 
G-protein coupling via an interaction with the Gβ subunit. This structure
provides a new framework for understanding G-protein-coupled receptor function.

The tremendous diversity of species in ecological communities has motivated a
century of research into the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. However, much
of this work examines the coexistence of just pairs of competitors. This approach
ignores those mechanisms of coexistence that emerge only in diverse competitive
networks. Despite the potential for these mechanisms to create conditions under
which the loss of one competitor triggers the loss of others, we lack the
knowledge needed to judge their importance for coexistence in nature. Progress
requires borrowing insight from the study of multitrophic interaction networks,
and coupling empirical data to models of competition.

Biodiversity enhances many of nature's benefits to people, including the
regulation of climate and the production of wood in forests, livestock forage in 
grasslands and fish in aquatic ecosystems. Yet people are now driving the sixth
mass extinction event in Earth's history. Human dependence and influence on
biodiversity have mainly been studied separately and at contrasting scales of
space and time, but new multiscale knowledge is beginning to link these
relationships. Biodiversity loss substantially diminishes several ecosystem
services by altering ecosystem functioning and stability, especially at the large
temporal and spatial scales that are most relevant for policy and conservation.

International agreements mandate the expansion of Earth's protected-area network 
as a bulwark against the continued extinction of wild populations, species, and
ecosystems. Yet many protected areas are underfunded, poorly managed, and
ecologically damaged; the conundrum is how to increase their coverage and
effectiveness simultaneously. Innovative restoration and rewilding programmes in 
Costa Rica's Área de Conservación Guanacaste and Mozambique's Parque Nacional da 
Gorongosa highlight how degraded ecosystems can be rehabilitated, expanded, and
woven into the cultural fabric of human societies. Worldwide, enormous potential 
for biodiversity conservation can be realized by upgrading existing nature
reserves while harmonizing them with the needs and aspirations of their
constituencies.

Coral reefs support immense biodiversity and provide important ecosystem services
to many millions of people. Yet reefs are degrading rapidly in response to
numerous anthropogenic drivers. In the coming centuries, reefs will run the
gauntlet of climate change, and rising temperatures will transform them into new 
configurations, unlike anything observed previously by humans. Returning reefs to
past configurations is no longer an option. Instead, the global challenge is to
steer reefs through the Anthropocene era in a way that maintains their biological
functions. Successful navigation of this transition will require radical changes 
in the science, management and governance of coral reefs.

Speciation gradients and the distribution of biodiversity.

Global patterns of biodiversity are influenced by spatial and environmental
variations in the rate at which new species form. We relate variations in
speciation rates to six key patterns of biodiversity worldwide, including the
species-area relationship, latitudinal gradients in species and genetic
diversity, and between-habitat differences in species richness. Although they
sometimes mirror biodiversity patterns, recent rates of speciation, at the tip of
the tree of life, are often highest where species richness is low. Speciation
gradients therefore shape, but are also shaped by, biodiversity gradients and are
often more useful for predicting future patterns of biodiversity than for
interpreting the past.

Tens of thousands of species are threatened with extinction as a result of human 
activities. Here we explore how the extinction risks of terrestrial mammals and
birds might change in the next 50 years. Future population growth and economic
development are forecasted to impose unprecedented levels of extinction risk on
many more species worldwide, especially the large mammals of tropical Africa,
Asia and South America. Yet these threats are not inevitable. Proactive
international efforts to increase crop yields, minimize land clearing and habitat
fragmentation, and protect natural lands could increase food security in
developing nations and preserve much of Earth's remaining biodiversity.

Tumour-specific CD8 T cells in solid tumours are dysfunctional, allowing tumours 
to progress. The epigenetic regulation of T cell dysfunction and therapeutic
reprogrammability (for example, to immune checkpoint blockade) is not well
understood. Here we show that T cells in mouse tumours differentiate through two 
discrete chromatin states: a plastic dysfunctional state from which T cells can
be rescued, and a fixed dysfunctional state in which the cells are resistant to
reprogramming. We identified surface markers associated with each chromatin state
that distinguished reprogrammable from non-reprogrammable PD1hi dysfunctional T
cells within heterogeneous T cell populations from tumours in mice; these surface
markers were also expressed on human PD1hi tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Our
study has important implications for cancer immunotherapy as we define key
transcription factors and epigenetic programs underlying T cell dysfunction and
surface markers that predict therapeutic reprogrammability.

shown that ZIKV has evolved into African and Asian lineages. The Asian lineage of
ZIKV was responsible for the recent epidemics in the Americas. However, the
underlying mechanisms through which ZIKV rapidly and explosively spread from Asia
to the Americas are unclear. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates
flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes from an infected mammalian host and
subsequently enhances viral prevalence in mosquitoes. Here we show that NS1
antigenaemia determines ZIKV infectivity in its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti,
which acquires ZIKV via a blood meal. Clinical isolates from the most recent
outbreak in the Americas were much more infectious in mosquitoes than the
FSS13025 strain, which was isolated in Cambodia in 2010. Further analyses showed 
that these epidemic strains have higher NS1 antigenaemia than the FSS13025 strain
because of an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution at residue 188 in NS1.
ZIKV infectivity was enhanced by this amino acid substitution in the ZIKV
FSS13025 strain in mosquitoes that acquired ZIKV from a viraemic C57BL/6 mouse
deficient in type I and II interferon (IFN) receptors (AG6 mouse). Our results
reveal that ZIKV evolved to acquire a spontaneous mutation in its NS1 protein,
resulting in increased NS1 antigenaemia. Enhancement of NS1 antigenaemia in
infected hosts promotes ZIKV infectivity and prevalence in mosquitoes, which
could have facilitated transmission during recent ZIKV epidemics.

Controlling plant disease has been a struggle for humankind since the advent of
agriculture. Studies of plant immune mechanisms have led to strategies of
engineering resistant crops through ectopic transcription of plants' own defence 
genes, such as the master immune regulatory gene NPR1 (ref. 1). However, enhanced
resistance obtained through such strategies is often associated with substantial 
penalties to fitness, making the resulting products undesirable for agricultural 
applications. To remedy this problem, we sought more stringent mechanisms of
expressing defence proteins. On the basis of our latest finding that translation 
of key immune regulators, such as TBF1 (ref. 3), is rapidly and transiently
induced upon pathogen challenge (see accompanying paper), we developed a
'TBF1-cassette' consisting of not only the immune-inducible promoter but also two
pathogen-responsive upstream open reading frames (uORFsTBF1) of the TBF1 gene.
Here we demonstrate that inclusion of uORFsTBF1-mediated translational control
over the production of snc1-1 (an autoactivated immune receptor) in Arabidopsis
thaliana and AtNPR1 in rice enables us to engineer broad-spectrum disease
resistance without compromising plant fitness in the laboratory or in the field. 
This broadly applicable strategy may lead to decreased pesticide use and reduce
the selective pressure for resistant pathogens.

In the absence of specialized immune cells, the need for plants to reprogram
transcription to transition from growth-related activities to defence is well
understood. However, little is known about translational changes that occur
during immune induction. Using ribosome footprinting, here we perform global
translatome profiling on Arabidopsis exposed to the microbe-associated molecular 
pattern elf18. We find that during this pattern-triggered immunity, translation
is tightly regulated and poorly correlated with transcription. Identification of 
genes with altered translational efficiency leads to the discovery of novel
regulators of this immune response. Further investigation of these genes shows
that messenger RNA sequence features are major determinants of the observed
translational efficiency changes. In the 5' leader sequences of transcripts with 
increased translational efficiency, we find a highly enriched messenger RNA
consensus sequence, R-motif, consisting of mostly purines. We show that R-motif
regulates translation in response to pattern-triggered immunity induction through
interaction with poly(A)-binding proteins. Therefore, this study provides not
only strong evidence, but also a molecular mechanism, for global translational
reprogramming during pattern-triggered immunity in plants.

In humans and other mammalian species, lesions in the preoptic area of the
hypothalamus cause profound sleep impairment, indicating a crucial role of the
preoptic area in sleep generation. However, the underlying circuit mechanism
remains poorly understood. Electrophysiological recordings and c-Fos
immunohistochemistry have shown the existence of sleep-active neurons in the
preoptic area, especially in the ventrolateral preoptic area and median preoptic 
nucleus. Pharmacogenetic activation of c-Fos-labelled sleep-active neurons has
been shown to induce sleep. However, the sleep-active neurons are spatially
intermingled with wake-active neurons, making it difficult to target the sleep
neurons specifically for circuit analysis. Here we identify a population of
preoptic area sleep neurons on the basis of their projection target and discover 
their molecular markers. Using a lentivirus expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or a
light-activated chloride channel for retrograde labelling, bidirectional
optogenetic manipulation, and optrode recording, we show that the preoptic area
GABAergic neurons projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus are both sleep
active and sleep promoting. Furthermore, translating ribosome affinity
purification and single-cell RNA sequencing identify candidate markers for these 
neurons, and optogenetic and pharmacogenetic manipulations demonstrate that
several peptide markers (cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and
tachykinin 1) label sleep-promoting neurons. Together, these findings provide
easy genetic access to sleep-promoting preoptic area neurons and a valuable entry
point for dissecting the sleep control circuit.

Reprogrammed cellular metabolism is a common characteristic observed in various
cancers. However, whether metabolic changes directly regulate cancer development 
and progression remains poorly understood. Here we show that BCAT1, a cytosolic
aminotransferase for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), is aberrantly activated 
and functionally required for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in humans and in
mouse models of CML. BCAT1 is upregulated during progression of CML and promotes 
BCAA production in leukaemia cells by aminating the branched-chain keto acids.
Blocking BCAT1 gene expression or enzymatic activity induces cellular
differentiation and impairs the propagation of blast crisis CML both in vitro and
in vivo. Stable-isotope tracer experiments combined with nuclear magnetic
resonance-based metabolic analysis demonstrate the intracellular production of
BCAAs by BCAT1. Direct supplementation with BCAAs ameliorates the defects caused 
by BCAT1 knockdown, indicating that BCAT1 exerts its oncogenic function through
BCAA production in blast crisis CML cells. Importantly, BCAT1 expression not only
is activated in human blast crisis CML and de novo acute myeloid leukaemia, but
also predicts disease outcome in patients. As an upstream regulator of BCAT1
expression, we identified Musashi2 (MSI2), an oncogenic RNA binding protein that 
is required for blast crisis CML. MSI2 is physically associated with the BCAT1
transcript and positively regulates its protein expression in leukaemia. Taken
together, this work reveals that altered BCAA metabolism activated through the
MSI2-BCAT1 axis drives cancer progression in myeloid leukaemia.

The physiology of a cell can be viewed as the product of thousands of proteins
acting in concert to shape the cellular response. Coordination is achieved in
part through networks of protein-protein interactions that assemble functionally 
related proteins into complexes, organelles, and signal transduction pathways.
Understanding the architecture of the human proteome has the potential to inform 
cellular, structural, and evolutionary mechanisms and is critical to elucidating 
how genome variation contributes to disease. Here we present BioPlex 2.0
(Biophysical Interactions of ORFeome-derived complexes), which uses robust
affinity purification-mass spectrometry methodology to elucidate protein
interaction networks and co-complexes nucleated by more than 25% of
protein-coding genes from the human genome, and constitutes, to our knowledge,
the largest such network so far. With more than 56,000 candidate interactions,
BioPlex 2.0 contains more than 29,000 previously unknown co-associations and
provides functional insights into hundreds of poorly characterized proteins while
enhancing network-based analyses of domain associations, subcellular
localization, and co-complex formation. Unsupervised Markov clustering of
interacting proteins identified more than 1,300 protein communities representing 
diverse cellular activities. Genes essential for cell fitness are enriched within
53 communities representing central cellular functions. Moreover, we identified
442 communities associated with more than 2,000 disease annotations, placing
numerous candidate disease genes into a cellular framework. BioPlex 2.0 exceeds
previous experimentally derived interaction networks in depth and breadth, and
will be a valuable resource for exploring the biology of incompletely
characterized proteins and for elucidating larger-scale patterns of proteome
organization.

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is
upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Tumour
cells frequently overexpress the ligand for PD-1, programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1), facilitating their escape from the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies 
that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, by binding to either the
ligand or receptor, have shown notable clinical efficacy in patients with a
variety of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung
cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although it is well established that PD-1-PD-L1
blockade activates T cells, little is known about the role that this pathway may 
have in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here we show that both mouse and
human TAMs express PD-1. TAM PD-1 expression increases over time in mouse models 
of cancer and with increasing disease stage in primary human cancers. TAM PD-1
expression correlates negatively with phagocytic potency against tumour cells,
and blockade of PD-1-PD-L1 in vivo increases macrophage phagocytosis, reduces
tumour growth and lengthens the survival of mice in mouse models of cancer in a
macrophage-dependent fashion. This suggests that PD-1-PD-L1 therapies may also
function through a direct effect on macrophages, with substantial implications
for the treatment of cancer with these agents.

A variety of tissue lineages can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells by
mimicking embryonic development through stepwise exposure to morphogens, or by
conversion of one differentiated cell type into another by enforced expression of
master transcription factors. Here, to yield functional human haematopoietic stem
cells, we perform morphogen-directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem
cells into haemogenic endothelium followed by screening of 26 candidate
haematopoietic stem-cell-specifying transcription factors for their capacity to
promote multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment in mouse hosts. We recover seven
transcription factors (ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1 and SPI1) that are 
sufficient to convert haemogenic endothelium into haematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells that engraft myeloid, B and T cells in primary and secondary
mouse recipients. Our combined approach of morphogen-driven differentiation and
transcription-factor-mediated cell fate conversion produces haematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells from pluripotent stem cells and holds promise for modelling 
haematopoietic disease in humanized mice and for therapeutic strategies in
genetic blood disorders.

Developmental pathways that orchestrate the fleeting transition of endothelial
cells into haematopoietic stem cells remain undefined. Here we demonstrate a
tractable approach for fully reprogramming adult mouse endothelial cells to
haematopoietic stem cells (rEC-HSCs) through transient expression of the
transcription-factor-encoding genes Fosb, Gfi1, Runx1, and Spi1 (collectively
denoted hereafter as FGRS) and vascular-niche-derived angiocrine factors. The
induction phase (days 0-8) of conversion is initiated by expression of FGRS in
mature endothelial cells, which results in endogenous Runx1 expression. During
the specification phase (days 8-20), RUNX1+ FGRS-transduced endothelial cells
commit to a haematopoietic fate, yielding rEC-HSCs that no longer require FGRS
expression. The vascular niche drives a robust self-renewal and expansion phase
of rEC-HSCs (days 20-28). rEC-HSCs have a transcriptome and long-term
self-renewal capacity similar to those of adult haematopoietic stem cells, and
can be used for clonal engraftment and serial primary and secondary multi-lineage
reconstitution, including antigen-dependent adaptive immune function. Inhibition 
of TGFβ and CXCR7 or activation of BMP and CXCR4 signalling enhanced generation
of rEC-HSCs. Pluripotency-independent conversion of endothelial cells into
autologous authentic engraftable haematopoietic stem cells could aid treatment of
haematological disorders.

Vehicle emissions contribute to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and tropospheric 
ozone air pollution, affecting human health, crop yields and climate worldwide.
On-road diesel vehicles produce approximately 20 per cent of global anthropogenic
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are key PM2.5 and ozone precursors.
Regulated NOx emission limits in leading markets have been progressively
tightened, but current diesel vehicles emit far more NOx under real-world
operating conditions than during laboratory certification testing. Here we show
that across 11 markets, representing approximately 80 per cent of global diesel
vehicle sales, nearly one-third of on-road heavy-duty diesel vehicle emissions
and over half of on-road light-duty diesel vehicle emissions are in excess of
certification limits. These excess emissions (totalling 4.6 million tons) are
associated with about 38,000 PM2.5- and ozone-related premature deaths globally
in 2015, including about 10 per cent of all ozone-related premature deaths in the
28 European Union member states. Heavy-duty vehicles are the dominant contributor
to excess diesel NOx emissions and associated health impacts in almost all
regions. Adopting and enforcing next-generation standards (more stringent than
Euro 6/VI) could nearly eliminate real-world diesel-related NOx emissions in
these markets, avoiding approximately 174,000 global PM2.5- and ozone-related
premature deaths in 2040. Most of these benefits can be achieved by implementing 
Euro VI standards where they have not yet been adopted for heavy-duty vehicles.

Mantle plumes are buoyant upwellings of hot rock that transport heat from Earth's
core to its surface, generating anomalous regions of volcanism that are not
directly associated with plate tectonic processes. The best-studied example is
the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, but the emergence of two sub-parallel volcanic tracks
along this chain, Loa and Kea, and the systematic geochemical differences between
them have remained unexplained. Here we argue that the emergence of these tracks 
coincides with the appearance of other double volcanic tracks on the Pacific
plate and a recent azimuthal change in the motion of the plate. We propose a
three-part model that explains the evolution of Hawaiian double-track volcanism: 
first, mantle flow beneath the rapidly moving Pacific plate strongly tilts the
Hawaiian plume and leads to lateral separation between high- and low-pressure
melt source regions; second, the recent azimuthal change in Pacific plate motion 
exposes high- and low-pressure melt products as geographically distinct
volcanoes, explaining the simultaneous emergence of double-track volcanism across
the Pacific; and finally, secondary pyroxenite, which is formed as eclogite melt 
reacts with peridotite, dominates the low-pressure melt region beneath Loa-track 
volcanism, yielding the systematic geochemical differences observed between Loa- 
and Kea-type lavas. Our results imply that the formation of double-track
volcanism is transitory and can be used to identify and place temporal bounds on 
plate-motion changes.

The existence of massive (1011 solar masses) elliptical galaxies by redshift
z ≈ 4 (refs 1, 2, 3; when the Universe was 1.5 billion years old) necessitates
the presence of galaxies with star-formation rates exceeding 100 solar masses per
year at z > 6 (corresponding to an age of the Universe of less than 1 billion
years). Surveys have discovered hundreds of galaxies at these early cosmic
epochs, but their star-formation rates are more than an order of magnitude lower.
The only known galaxies with very high star-formation rates at z > 6 are, with
one exception, the host galaxies of quasars, but these galaxies also host
accreting supermassive (more than 109 solar masses) black holes, which probably
affect the properties of the galaxies. Here we report observations of an emission
line of singly ionized carbon ([C ii] at a wavelength of 158 micrometres) in four
galaxies at z > 6 that are companions of quasars, with velocity offsets of less
than 600 kilometres per second and linear offsets of less than 100 kiloparsecs.
The discovery of these four galaxies was serendipitous; they are close to their
companion quasars and appear bright in the far-infrared. On the basis of the [C
ii] measurements, we estimate star-formation rates in the companions of more than
100 solar masses per year. These sources are similar to the host galaxies of the 
quasars in [C ii] brightness, linewidth and implied dynamical mass, but do not
show evidence for accreting supermassive black holes. Similar systems have
previously been found at lower redshift. We find such close companions in four
out of the twenty-five z > 6 quasars surveyed, a fraction that needs to be
accounted for in simulations. If they are representative of the bright end of the
[C ii] luminosity function, then they can account for the population of massive
elliptical galaxies at z ≈ 4 in terms of the density of cosmic space.

Exotic phenomena in systems with strongly correlated electrons emerge from the
interplay between spin and motional degrees of freedom. For example, doping an
antiferromagnet is expected to give rise to pseudogap states and high-temperature
superconductors. Quantum simulation using ultracold fermions in optical lattices 
could help to answer open questions about the doped Hubbard Hamiltonian, and has 
recently been advanced by quantum gas microscopy. Here we report the realization 
of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a two-dimensional
square lattice of about 80 sites at a temperature of 0.25 times the tunnelling
energy. The antiferromagnetic long-range order manifests through the divergence
of the correlation length, which reaches the size of the system, the development 
of a peak in the spin structure factor and a staggered magnetization that is
close to the ground-state value. We hole-dope the system away from half-filling, 
towards a regime in which complex many-body states are expected, and find that
strong magnetic correlations persist at the antiferromagnetic ordering vector up 
to dopings of about 15 per cent. In this regime, numerical simulations are
challenging and so experiments provide a valuable benchmark. Our results
demonstrate that microscopy of cold atoms in optical lattices can help us to
understand the low-temperature Fermi-Hubbard model.

Genetically engineered T cells are powerful new medicines, offering hope for
curative responses in patients with cancer. Chimaeric antigen receptors (CARs)
are a class of synthetic receptors that reprogram lymphocyte specificity and
function. CARs targeting CD19 have demonstrated remarkable potency in B cell
malignancies. Engineered T cells are applicable in principle to many cancers,
pending further progress to identify suitable target antigens, overcome
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments, reduce toxicities, and prevent
antigen escape. Advances in the selection of optimal T cells, genetic
engineering, and cell manufacturing are poised to broaden T-cell-based therapies 
and foster new applications in infectious diseases and autoimmunity.

Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their internal circadian
clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating day-night cycles of light. The
fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day-night cycles in part through
rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells
in the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is
mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian
clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in
pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high
levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional
light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously
uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment 
by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to
violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused 
minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound
impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7
mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in
circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an
opsin in the central brain.

The Notch signalling pathway mediates cell fate decisions and is tumour
suppressive or oncogenic depending on the context. During lung development, Notch
pathway activation inhibits the differentiation of precursor cells to a
neuroendocrine fate. In small-cell lung cancer, an aggressive neuroendocrine lung
cancer, loss-of-function mutations in NOTCH genes and the inhibitory effects of
ectopic Notch activation indicate that Notch signalling is tumour suppressive.
Here we show that Notch signalling can be both tumour suppressive and
pro-tumorigenic in small-cell lung cancer. Endogenous activation of the Notch
pathway results in a neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine fate switch in 10-50%
of tumour cells in a mouse model of small-cell lung cancer and in human tumours. 
This switch is mediated in part by Rest (also known as Nrsf), a transcriptional
repressor that inhibits neuroendocrine gene expression. Non-neuroendocrine
Notch-active small-cell lung cancer cells are slow growing, consistent with a
tumour-suppressive role for Notch, but these cells are also relatively
chemoresistant and provide trophic support to neuroendocrine tumour cells,
consistent with a pro-tumorigenic role. Importantly, Notch blockade in
combination with chemotherapy suppresses tumour growth and delays relapse in
pre-clinical models. Thus, small-cell lung cancer tumours generate their own
microenvironment via activation of Notch signalling in a subset of tumour cells, 
and the presence of these cells may serve as a biomarker for the use of Notch
pathway inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in select patients with
small-cell lung cancer.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has a key role in the integration of
various physiological stimuli to regulate several cell growth and metabolic
pathways. mTOR primarily functions as a catalytic subunit in two structurally
related but functionally distinct multi-component kinase complexes, mTOR complex 
1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 (refs 1, 2). Dysregulation of mTOR signalling is associated
with a variety of human diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer. Thus,
both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity is tightly controlled in cells. mTORC1 is 
activated by both nutrients and growth factors, whereas mTORC2 responds primarily
to extracellular cues such as growth-factor-triggered activation of PI3K
signalling. Although both mTOR and GβL (also known as MLST8) assemble into mTORC1
and mTORC2 (refs 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), it remains largely unclear what drives the 
dynamic assembly of these two functionally distinct complexes. Here we show, in
humans and mice, that the K63-linked polyubiquitination status of GβL dictates
the homeostasis of mTORC2 formation and activation. Mechanistically, the TRAF2 E3
ubiquitin ligase promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of GβL, which disrupts
its interaction with the unique mTORC2 component SIN1 (refs 12, 13, 14) to favour
mTORC1 formation. By contrast, the OTUD7B deubiquitinase removes polyubiquitin
chains from GβL to promote GβL interaction with SIN1, facilitating mTORC2
formation in response to various growth signals. Moreover, loss of critical
ubiquitination residues in GβL, by either K305R/K313R mutations or a
melanoma-associated GβL(ΔW297) truncation, leads to elevated mTORC2 formation,
which facilitates tumorigenesis, in part by activating AKT oncogenic signalling. 
In support of a physiologically pivotal role for OTUD7B in the activation of
mTORC2/AKT signalling, genetic deletion of Otud7b in mice suppresses Akt
activation and Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis in vivo. Collectively, our study
reveals a GβL-ubiquitination-dependent switch that fine-tunes the dynamic
organization and activation of the mTORC2 kinase under both physiological and
pathological conditions.

High-resolution serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM) makes it possible to
investigate the dense meshwork of axons, dendrites, and synapses that form
neuronal circuits. However, the imaging scale required to comprehensively
reconstruct these structures is more than ten orders of magnitude smaller than
the spatial extents occupied by networks of interconnected neurons, some of which
span nearly the entire brain. Difficulties in generating and handling data for
large volumes at nanoscale resolution have thus restricted vertebrate studies to 
fragments of circuits. These efforts were recently transformed by advances in
computing, sample handling, and imaging techniques, but high-resolution
examination of entire brains remains a challenge. Here, we present ssEM data for 
the complete brain of a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) at 5.5 days
post-fertilization. Our approach utilizes multiple rounds of targeted imaging at 
different scales to reduce acquisition time and data management requirements. The
resulting dataset can be analysed to reconstruct neuronal processes, permitting
us to survey all myelinated axons (the projectome). These reconstructions enable 
precise investigations of neuronal morphology, which reveal remarkable bilateral 
symmetry in myelinated reticulospinal and lateral line afferent axons. We further
set the stage for whole-brain structure-function comparisons by co-registering
functional reference atlases and in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy data 
from the same specimen. All obtained images and reconstructions are provided as
an open-access resource.

Nutrient signalling integrates and coordinates gene expression, metabolism and
growth. However, its primary molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood 
in plants and animals. Here we report unique Ca2+ signalling triggered by nitrate
with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in Arabidopsis leaves and roots.
A nitrate-sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen identifies subgroup
III Ca2+-sensor protein kinases (CPKs) as master regulators that orchestrate
primary nitrate responses. A chemical switch with the engineered mutant
CPK10(M141G) circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional analyses of
cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 triple mutants to define comprehensive nitrate-associated
regulatory and developmental programs. Nitrate-coupled CPK signalling
phosphorylates conserved NIN-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors to specify 
the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription factors,
transporters, nitrogen assimilation, carbon/nitrogen metabolism, redox,
signalling, hormones and proliferation. Conditional cpk10 cpk30 cpk32 and nlp7
mutants similarly impair nitrate-stimulated system-wide shoot growth and root
establishment. The nutrient-coupled Ca2+ signalling network integrates
transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot-root coordination and
developmental plasticity in shaping organ biomass and architecture.

Most small molecules are unable to rapidly traverse the outer membrane of
Gram-negative bacteria and accumulate inside these cells, making the discovery of
much-needed drugs against these pathogens challenging. Current understanding of
the physicochemical properties that dictate small-molecule accumulation in
Gram-negative bacteria is largely based on retrospective analyses of
antibacterial agents, which suggest that polarity and molecular weight are key
factors. Here we assess the ability of over 180 diverse compounds to accumulate
in Escherichia coli. Computational analysis of the results reveals major
differences from the retrospective studies, namely that the small molecules that 
are most likely to accumulate contain an amine, are amphiphilic and rigid, and
have low globularity. These guidelines were then applied to convert
deoxynybomycin, a natural product that is active only against Gram-positive
organisms, into an antibiotic with activity against a diverse panel of
multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We anticipate that these findings
will aid in the discovery and development of antibiotics against Gram-negative
bacteria.

The heterogeneity of cellular states in cancer has been linked to drug
resistance, cancer progression and the presence of cancer cells with properties
of normal tissue stem cells. Secreted Wnt signals maintain stem cells in various 
epithelial tissues, including in lung development and regeneration. Here we show 
that mouse and human lung adenocarcinomas display hierarchical features with two 
distinct subpopulations, one with high Wnt signalling activity and another
forming a niche that provides the Wnt ligand. The Wnt responder cells showed
increased tumour propagation ability, suggesting that these cells have features
of normal tissue stem cells. Genetic perturbation of Wnt production or signalling
suppressed tumour progression. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting essential
posttranslational modification of Wnt reduced tumour growth and markedly
decreased the proliferative potential of lung cancer cells, leading to improved
survival of tumour-bearing mice. These results indicate that strategies for
disrupting pathways that maintain stem-like and niche cell phenotypes can
translate into effective anti-cancer therapies.

The selective coupling of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to specific G
proteins is critical to trigger the appropriate physiological response. However, 
the determinants of selective binding have remained elusive. Here we reveal the
existence of a selectivity barcode (that is, patterns of amino acids) on each of 
the 16 human G proteins that is recognized by distinct regions on the
approximately 800 human receptors. Although universally conserved positions in
the barcode allow the receptors to bind and activate G proteins in a similar
manner, different receptors recognize the unique positions of the G-protein
barcode through distinct residues, like multiple keys (receptors) opening the
same lock (G protein) using non-identical cuts. Considering the evolutionary
history of GPCRs allows the identification of these selectivity-determining
residues. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the molecular basis
of coupling selectivity within individual receptors and G proteins.

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are a cause of stroke and seizure for
which no effective medical therapies yet exist. CCMs arise from the loss of an
adaptor complex that negatively regulates MEKK3-KLF2/4 signalling in brain
endothelial cells, but upstream activators of this disease pathway have yet to be
identified. Here we identify endothelial Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the gut 
microbiome as critical stimulants of CCM formation. Activation of TLR4 by
Gram-negative bacteria or lipopolysaccharide accelerates CCM formation, and
genetic or pharmacologic blockade of TLR4 signalling prevents CCM formation in
mice. Polymorphisms that increase expression of the TLR4 gene or the gene
encoding its co-receptor CD14 are associated with higher CCM lesion burden in
humans. Germ-free mice are protected from CCM formation, and a single course of
antibiotics permanently alters CCM susceptibility in mice. These studies identify
unexpected roles for the microbiome and innate immune signalling in the
pathogenesis of a cerebrovascular disease, as well as strategies for its
treatment.

The global geodynamic regime of early Earth, which operated before the onset of
plate tectonics, remains contentious. As geological and geochemical data suggest 
hotter Archean mantle temperature and more intense juvenile magmatism than in the
present-day Earth, two crust-mantle interaction modes differing in melt eruption 
efficiency have been proposed: the Io-like heat-pipe tectonics regime dominated
by volcanism and the "Plutonic squishy lid" tectonics regime governed by
intrusive magmatism, which is thought to apply to the dynamics of Venus. Both
tectonics regimes are capable of producing primordial
tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) continental crust but lithospheric
geotherms and crust production rates as well as proportions of various TTG
compositions differ greatly, which implies that the heat-pipe and Plutonic
squishy lid hypotheses can be tested using natural data. Here we investigate the 
creation of primordial TTG-like continental crust using self-consistent numerical
models of global thermochemical convection associated with magmatic processes. We
show that the volcanism-dominated heat-pipe tectonics model results in cold
crustal geotherms and is not able to produce Earth-like primordial continental
crust. In contrast, the Plutonic squishy lid tectonics regime dominated by
intrusive magmatism results in hotter crustal geotherms and is capable of
reproducing the observed proportions of various TTG rocks. Using a systematic
parameter study, we show that the typical modern eruption efficiency of less than
40 per cent leads to the production of the expected amounts of the three main
primordial crustal compositions previously reported from field data (low-,
medium- and high-pressure TTG). Our study thus suggests that the
pre-plate-tectonics Archean Earth operated globally in the Plutonic squishy lid
regime rather than in an Io-like heat-pipe regime.

Many of Earth's great earthquakes occur on thrust faults. These earthquakes
predominantly occur within subduction zones, such as the 2011 moment magnitude
9.0 eathquake in Tohoku-Oki, Japan, or along large collision zones, such as the
1999 moment magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Chi-Chi, Taiwan. Notably, these two
earthquakes had a maximum slip that was very close to the surface. This
contributed to the destructive tsunami that occurred during the Tohoku-Oki event 
and to the large amount of structural damage caused by the Chi-Chi event. The
mechanism that results in such large slip near the surface is poorly understood
as shallow parts of thrust faults are considered to be frictionally stable. Here 
we use earthquake rupture experiments to reveal the existence of a torquing
mechanism of thrust fault ruptures near the free surface that causes them to
unclamp and slip large distances. Complementary numerical modelling of the
experiments confirms that the hanging-wall wedge undergoes pronounced rotation in
one direction as the earthquake rupture approaches the free surface, and this
torque is released as soon as the rupture breaks the free surface, resulting in
the unclamping and violent 'flapping' of the hanging-wall wedge. Our results
imply that the shallow extent of the seismogenic zone of a subducting interface
is not fixed and can extend up to the trench during great earthquakes through a
torquing mechanism.

Netrin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved, secreted extracellular matrix protein
involved in axon guidance at the central nervous system midline. Netrin-1 is
expressed by cells localized at the central nervous system midline, such as those
of the floor plate in vertebrate embryos. Growth cone turning assays and
three-dimensional gel diffusion assays have shown that netrin-1 can attract
commissural axons. Loss-of-function experiments further demonstrated that
commissural axon extension to the midline is severely impaired in the absence of 
netrin-1 (refs 3, 7, 8, 9). Together, these data have long supported a model in
which commissural axons are attracted by a netrin-1 gradient diffusing from the
midline. Here we selectively ablate netrin-1 expression in floor-plate cells
using a Ntn1 conditional knockout mouse line. We find that hindbrain and spinal
cord commissural axons develop normally in the absence of floor-plate-derived
netrin-1. Furthermore, we show that netrin-1 is highly expressed by cells in the 
ventricular zone, which can release netrin-1 at the pial surface where it binds
to commissural axons. Notably, Ntn1 deletion from the ventricular zone
phenocopies commissural axon guidance defects previously described in
Ntn1-knockout mice. These results show that the classical view that attraction of
commissural axons is mediated by a gradient of floor-plate-derived netrin-1 is
inaccurate and that netrin-1 primarily acts locally by promoting growth cone
adhesion.

Quantum systems can be characterized by their correlations. Higher-order (larger 
than second order) correlations, and the ways in which they can be decomposed
into correlations of lower order, provide important information about the system,
its structure, its interactions and its complexity. The measurement of such
correlation functions is therefore an essential tool for reading, verifying and
characterizing quantum simulations. Although higher-order correlation functions
are frequently used in theoretical calculations, so far mainly correlations up to
second order have been studied experimentally. Here we study a pair of
tunnel-coupled one-dimensional atomic superfluids and characterize the
corresponding quantum many-body problem by measuring correlation functions. We
extract phase correlation functions up to tenth order from interference patterns 
and analyse whether, and under what conditions, these functions factorize into
correlations of lower order. This analysis characterizes the essential features
of our system, the relevant quasiparticles, their interactions and topologically 
distinct vacua. From our data we conclude that in thermal equilibrium our system 
can be seen as a quantum simulator of the sine-Gordon model, relevant for diverse
disciplines ranging from particle physics to condensed matter. The measurement
and evaluation of higher-order correlation functions can easily be generalized to
other systems and to study correlations of any other observable such as density, 
spin and magnetization. It therefore represents a general method for analysing
quantum many-body systems from experimental data.

Coordination in groups faces a sub-optimization problem and theory suggests that 
some randomness may help to achieve global optima. Here we performed experiments 
involving a networked colour coordination game in which groups of humans
interacted with autonomous software agents (known as bots). Subjects (n = 4,000) 
were embedded in networks (n = 230) of 20 nodes, to which we sometimes added 3
bots. The bots were programmed with varying levels of behavioural randomness and 
different geodesic locations. We show that bots acting with small levels of
random noise and placed in central locations meaningfully improve the collective 
performance of human groups, accelerating the median solution time by 55.6%. This
is especially the case when the coordination problem is hard. Behavioural
randomness worked not only by making the task of humans to whom the bots were
connected easier, but also by affecting the gameplay of the humans among
themselves and hence creating further cascades of benefit in global coordination 
in these heterogeneous systems.

Melanoma of the skin is a common cancer only in Europeans, whereas it arises in
internal body surfaces (mucosal sites) and on the hands and feet (acral sites) in
people throughout the world. Here we report analysis of whole-genome sequences
from cutaneous, acral and mucosal subtypes of melanoma. The heavily mutated
landscape of coding and non-coding mutations in cutaneous melanoma resolved novel
signatures of mutagenesis attributable to ultraviolet radiation. However, acral
and mucosal melanomas were dominated by structural changes and mutation
signatures of unknown aetiology, not previously identified in melanoma. The
number of genes affected by recurrent mutations disrupting non-coding sequences
was similar to that affected by recurrent mutations to coding sequences.
Significantly mutated genes included BRAF, CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous
melanoma, BRAF, NRAS and NF1 in acral melanoma and SF3B1 in mucosal melanoma.
Mutations affecting the TERT promoter were the most frequent of all; however,
neither they nor ATRX mutations, which correlate with alternative telomere
lengthening, were associated with greater telomere length. Most melanomas had
potentially actionable mutations, most in components of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase and phosphoinositol kinase pathways. The whole-genome mutation
landscape of melanoma reveals diverse carcinogenic processes across its subtypes,
some unrelated to sun exposure, and extends potential involvement of the
non-coding genome in its pathogenesis.

Susceptibility and protection against human autoimmune diseases, including type I
diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and Goodpasture disease, is associated with
particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. However, the mechanisms
underpinning such HLA-mediated effects on self-tolerance remain unclear. Here we 
investigate the molecular mechanism of Goodpasture disease, an HLA-linked
autoimmune renal disorder characterized by an immunodominant CD4+ T-cell
self-epitope derived from the α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3135-145). While
HLA-DR15 confers a markedly increased disease risk, the protective HLA-DR1 allele
is dominantly protective in trans with HLA-DR15 (ref. 2). We show that
autoreactive α3135-145-specific T cells expand in patients with Goodpasture
disease and, in α3135-145-immunized HLA-DR15 transgenic mice, α3135-145-specific 
T cells infiltrate the kidney and mice develop Goodpasture disease. HLA-DR15 and 
HLA-DR1 exhibit distinct peptide repertoires and binding preferences and present 
the α3135-145 epitope in different binding registers. HLA-DR15-α3135-145
tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR15 transgenic mice exhibit a conventional T-cell
phenotype (Tconv) that secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast,
HLA-DR1-α3135-145 tetramer+ T cells in HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice
are predominantly CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing
tolerogenic cytokines. HLA-DR1-induced Treg cells confer resistance to disease in
HLA-DR15/DR1 transgenic mice. HLA-DR15+ and HLA-DR1+ healthy human donors display
altered α3135-145-specific T-cell antigen receptor usage, HLA-DR15-α3135-145
tetramer+ Foxp3- Tconv and HLA-DR1-α3135-145 tetramer+ Foxp3+CD25hiCD127lo Treg
dominant phenotypes. Moreover, patients with Goodpasture disease display a
clonally expanded α3135-145-specific CD4+ T-cell repertoire. Accordingly, we
provide a mechanistic basis for the dominantly protective effect of HLA in
autoimmune disease, whereby HLA polymorphism shapes the relative abundance of
self-epitope specific Treg cells that leads to protection or causation of
autoimmunity.

Although interactions between the thalamus and cortex are critical for cognitive 
function, the exact contribution of the thalamus to these interactions remains
unclear. Recent studies have shown diverse connectivity patterns across the
thalamus, but whether this diversity translates to thalamic functions beyond
relaying information to or between cortical regions is unknown. Here we show, by 
investigating the representation of two rules used to guide attention in the
mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), that the mediodorsal thalamus sustains these
representations without relaying categorical information. Specifically,
mediodorsal input amplifies local PFC connectivity, enabling rule-specific neural
sequences to emerge and thereby maintain rule representations. Consistent with
this notion, broadly enhancing PFC excitability diminishes rule specificity and
behavioural performance, whereas enhancing mediodorsal excitability improves
both. Overall, our results define a previously unknown principle in neuroscience;
thalamic control of functional cortical connectivity. This function, which is
dissociable from categorical information relay, indicates that the thalamus has a
much broader role in cognition than previously thought.

Mediator is a multiprotein co-activator that binds the transcription
pre-initiation complex (PIC) and regulates RNA polymerase (Pol) II. The Mediator 
head and middle modules form the essential core Mediator (cMed), whereas the tail
and kinase modules play regulatory roles. The architecture of Mediator and its
position on the PIC are known, but atomic details are limited to Mediator
subcomplexes. Here we report the crystal structure of the 15-subunit cMed from
Schizosaccharomyces pombe at 3.4 Å resolution. The structure shows an unaltered
head module, and reveals the intricate middle module, which we show is globally
required for transcription. Sites of known Mediator mutations cluster at the
interface between the head and middle modules, and in terminal regions of the
head subunits Med6 (ref. 16) and Med17 (ref. 17) that tether the middle module.
The structure led to a model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae cMed that could be
combined with the 3.6 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the core PIC
(cPIC). The resulting atomic model of the cPIC-cMed complex informs on
interactions of the submodules forming the middle module, called beam, knob,
plank, connector, and hook. The hook is flexibly linked to Mediator by a
conserved hinge and contacts the transcription initiation factor IIH (TFIIH)
kinase that phosphorylates the carboxy (C)-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II and
was recently positioned on the PIC. The hook also contains residues that
crosslink to the CTD and reside in a previously described cradle. These results
provide a framework for understanding Mediator function, including its role in
stimulating CTD phosphorylation by TFIIH.

Blood and lymphatic vasculatures are intimately involved in tissue oxygenation
and fluid homeostasis maintenance. Assembly of these vascular networks involves
sprouting, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Recent studies have 
suggested that changes in cellular metabolism are important to these processes.
Although much is known about vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent 
regulation of vascular development and metabolism, little is understood about the
role of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in this context. Here we identify FGF
receptor (FGFR) signalling as a critical regulator of vascular development. This 
is achieved by FGF-dependent control of c-MYC (MYC) expression that, in turn,
regulates expression of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2). A decrease in
HK2 levels in the absence of FGF signalling inputs results in decreased
glycolysis, leading to impaired endothelial cell proliferation and migration.
Pan-endothelial- and lymphatic-specific Hk2 knockouts phenocopy blood and/or
lymphatic vascular defects seen in Fgfr1/Fgfr3 double mutant mice, while HK2
overexpression partly rescues the defects caused by suppression of FGF
signalling. Thus, FGF-dependent regulation of endothelial glycolysis is a pivotal
process in developmental and adult vascular growth and development.

The lipid bilayer has so far eluded visualization by conventional
crystallographic methods, severely limiting our understanding of phospholipid-
and protein-phospholipid interactions. Here we describe electron density maps for
crystals of Ca2+-ATPase in four different states obtained by X-ray solvent
contrast modulation. These maps resolve the entire first layer of phospholipids
surrounding the transmembrane helices, although less than half of them are
hydrogen-bonded to protein residues. Phospholipids follow the movements of
associated residues, causing local distortions and changes in thickness of the
bilayer. Unexpectedly, the entire protein tilts during the reaction cycle,
governed primarily by a belt of Trp residues, to minimize energy costs
accompanying the large perpendicular movements of the transmembrane helices. A
class of Arg residues extend their side chains through the cytoplasm to exploit
phospholipids as anchors for conformational switching. Thus, phospholipid-Arg/Lys
and phospholipid-Trp interactions have distinct functional roles in the dynamics 
of ion pumps and, presumably, membrane proteins in general.

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway governs diverse developmental,
homeostatic and pathological processes. Palmitoylated Wnt ligands engage
cell-surface frizzled (FZD) receptors and LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors, enabling
β-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF-dependent gene transactivation.
Mutations in Wnt downstream signalling components have revealed diverse functions
thought to be carried out by Wnt ligands themselves. However, redundancy between 
the 19 mammalian Wnt proteins and 10 FZD receptors and Wnt hydrophobicity have
made it difficult to attribute these functions directly to Wnt ligands. For
example, individual mutations in Wnt ligands have not revealed homeostatic
phenotypes in the intestinal epithelium-an archetypal canonical, Wnt
pathway-dependent, rapidly self-renewing tissue, the regeneration of which is
fueled by proliferative crypt Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs). R-spondin
ligands (RSPO1-RSPO4) engage distinct LGR4-LGR6, RNF43 and ZNRF3 receptor
classes, markedly potentiate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and induce
intestinal organoid growth in vitro and Lgr5+ ISCs in vivo. However, the
interchangeability, functional cooperation and relative contributions of Wnt
versus RSPO ligands to in vivo canonical Wnt signalling and ISC biology remain
unknown. Here we identify the functional roles of Wnt and RSPO ligands in the
intestinal crypt stem-cell niche. We show that the default fate of Lgr5+ ISCs is 
to differentiate, unless both RSPO and Wnt ligands are present. However,
gain-of-function studies using RSPO ligands and a new non-lipidated Wnt analogue 
reveal that these ligands have qualitatively distinct, non-interchangeable roles 
in ISCs. Wnt proteins are unable to induce Lgr5+ ISC self-renewal, but instead
confer a basal competency by maintaining RSPO receptor expression that enables
RSPO ligands to actively drive and specify the extent of stem-cell expansion.
This functionally non-equivalent yet cooperative interaction between Wnt and RSPO
ligands establishes a molecular precedent for regulation of mammalian stem cells 
by distinct priming and self-renewal factors, with broad implications for precise
control of tissue regeneration.

Wnt proteins modulate cell proliferation and differentiation and the self-renewal
of stem cells by inducing β-catenin-dependent signalling through the Wnt receptor
frizzled (FZD) and the co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 to regulate cell fate decisions
and the growth and repair of several tissues. The 19 mammalian Wnt proteins are
cross-reactive with the 10 FZD receptors, and this has complicated the
attribution of distinct biological functions to specific FZD and Wnt subtype
interactions. Furthermore, Wnt proteins are modified post-translationally by
palmitoylation, which is essential for their secretion, function and interaction 
with FZD receptors. As a result of their acylation, Wnt proteins are very
hydrophobic and require detergents for purification, which presents major
obstacles to the preparation and application of recombinant Wnt proteins. This
hydrophobicity has hindered the determination of the molecular mechanisms of Wnt 
signalling activation and the functional importance of FZD subtypes, and the use 
of Wnt proteins as therapeutic agents. Here we develop surrogate Wnt agonists,
water-soluble FZD-LRP5/LRP6 heterodimerizers, with FZD5/FZD8-specific and broadly
FZD-reactive binding domains. Similar to WNT3A, these Wnt agonists elicit a
characteristic β-catenin signalling response in a FZD-selective fashion, enhance 
the osteogenic lineage commitment of primary mouse and human mesenchymal stem
cells, and support the growth of a broad range of primary human organoid
cultures. In addition, the surrogates can be systemically expressed and exhibit
Wnt activity in vivo in the mouse liver, regulating metabolic liver zonation and 
promoting hepatocyte proliferation, resulting in hepatomegaly. These surrogates
demonstrate that canonical Wnt signalling can be activated by bi-specific ligands
that induce receptor heterodimerization. Furthermore, these easily produced,
non-lipidated Wnt surrogate agonists facilitate functional studies of Wnt
signalling and the exploration of Wnt agonists for translational applications in 
regenerative medicine.

Persistent neural activity maintains information that connects past and future
events. Models of persistent activity often invoke reverberations within local
cortical circuits, but long-range circuits could also contribute. Neurons in the 
mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) have been shown to have selective
persistent activity that instructs future actions. The ALM is connected
bidirectionally with parts of the thalamus, including the ventral medial and
ventral anterior-lateral nuclei. We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus
during tactile discrimination with a delayed directional response. Here we show
that, similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent
delay activity that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of
delay activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect.
Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete collapse
of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished thalamic
activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in motor
preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal excitation
across multiple brain areas.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPS cells) can self-renew indefinitely, making them
an attractive source for regenerative therapies. This expansion potential has
been linked with the acquisition of large copy number variants that provide
mutated cells with a growth advantage in culture. The nature, extent and
functional effects of other acquired genome sequence mutations in cultured hPS
cells are not known. Here we sequence the protein-coding genes (exomes) of 140
independent human embryonic stem cell (hES cell) lines, including 26 lines
prepared for potential clinical use. We then apply computational strategies for
identifying mutations present in a subset of cells in each hES cell line.
Although such mosaic mutations were generally rare, we identified five unrelated 
hES cell lines that carried six mutations in the TP53 gene that encodes the
tumour suppressor P53. The TP53 mutations we observed are dominant negative and
are the mutations most commonly seen in human cancers. We found that the TP53
mutant allelic fraction increased with passage number under standard culture
conditions, suggesting that the P53 mutations confer selective advantage. We then
mined published RNA sequencing data from 117 hPS cell lines, and observed another
nine TP53 mutations, all resulting in coding changes in the DNA-binding domain of
P53. In three lines, the allelic fraction exceeded 50%, suggesting additional
selective advantage resulting from the loss of heterozygosity at the TP53 locus. 
As the acquisition and expansion of cancer-associated mutations in hPS cells may 
go unnoticed during most applications, we suggest that careful genetic
characterization of hPS cells and their differentiated derivatives be carried out
before clinical use.

Optimizing the morphology of metal halide perovskite films is an important way to
improve the performance of solar cells when these materials are used as light
harvesters, because film homogeneity is correlated with photovoltaic performance.
Many device architectures and processing techniques have been explored with the
aim of achieving high-performance devices, including single-step deposition,
sequential deposition and anti-solvent methods. Earlier studies have looked at
the influence of reaction conditions on film quality, such as the concentration
of the reactants and the reaction temperature. However, the precise mechanism of 
the reaction and the main factors that govern it are poorly understood. The
consequent lack of control is the main reason for the large variability observed 
in perovskite morphology and the related solar-cell performance. Here we show
that light has a strong influence on the rate of perovskite formation and on film
morphology in both of the main deposition methods currently used: sequential
deposition and the anti-solvent method. We study the reaction of a metal halide
(lead iodide) with an organic compound (methylammonium iodide) using confocal
laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The lead
iodide crystallizes before the intercalation of methylammonium iodide commences, 
producing the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. We find that the formation
of perovskite via such a sequential deposition is much accelerated by light. The 
influence of light on morphology is reflected in a doubling of solar-cell
efficiency. Conversely, using the anti-solvent method to form methyl ammonium
lead iodide perovskite in a single step from the same starting materials, we find
that the best photovoltaic performance is obtained when films are produced in the
dark. The discovery of light-activated crystallization not only identifies a
previously unknown source of variability in opto-electronic properties, but also 
opens up new ways of tuning morphology and structuring perovskites for various
applications.

Olefin chemistry, through pericyclic reactions, polymerizations, oxidations, or
reductions, has an essential role in the manipulation of organic matter. Despite 
its importance, olefin synthesis still relies largely on chemistry introduced
more than three decades ago, with metathesis being the most recent addition. Here
we describe a simple method of accessing olefins with any substitution pattern or
geometry from one of the most ubiquitous and variegated building blocks of
chemistry: alkyl carboxylic acids. The activating principles used in amide-bond
synthesis can therefore be used, with nickel- or iron-based catalysis, to extract
carbon dioxide from a carboxylic acid and economically replace it with an
organozinc-derived olefin on a molar scale. We prepare more than 60 olefins
across a range of substrate classes, and the ability to simplify retrosynthetic
analysis is exemplified with the preparation of 16 different natural products
across 10 different families.

The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory highlights a self-renewing subpopulation of
cancer cells that fuels tumour growth. The existence of human CSCs is mainly
supported by xenotransplantation of prospectively isolated cells, but their
clonal dynamics and plasticity remain unclear. Here, we show that human LGR5+
colorectal cancer cells serve as CSCs in growing cancer tissues. Lineage-tracing 
experiments with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre knock-in allele of LGR5 reveal the
self-renewal and differentiation capacity of LGR5+ tumour cells. Selective
ablation of LGR5+ CSCs in LGR5-iCaspase9 knock-in organoids leads to tumour
regression, followed by tumour regrowth driven by re-emerging LGR5+ CSCs. KRT20
knock-in reporter marks differentiated cancer cells that constantly diminish in
tumour tissues, while reverting to LGR5+ CSCs and contributing to tumour regrowth
after LGR5+ CSC ablation. We also show that combined chemotherapy potentiates
targeting of LGR5+ CSCs. These data provide insights into the plasticity of CSCs 
and their potential as a therapeutic target in human colorectal cancer.

Laser cooling and trapping of atoms and atomic ions has led to advances including
the observation of exotic phases of matter, the development of precision sensors 
and state-of-the-art atomic clocks. The same level of control in molecules could 
also lead to important developments such as controlled chemical reactions and
sensitive probes of fundamental theories, but the vibrational and rotational
degrees of freedom in molecules pose a challenge for controlling their quantum
mechanical states. Here we use quantum-logic spectroscopy, which maps quantum
information between two ion species, to prepare and non-destructively detect
quantum mechanical states in molecular ions. We develop a general technique for
optical pumping and preparation of the molecule into a pure initial state. This
enables us to observe high-resolution spectra in a single ion (CaH+) and coherent
phenomena such as Rabi flopping and Ramsey fringes. The protocol requires a
single, far-off-resonant laser that is not specific to the molecule, so many
other molecular ions, including polyatomic species, could be treated using the
same methods in the same apparatus by changing the molecular source. Combined
with the long interrogation times afforded by ion traps, a broad range of
molecular ions could be studied with unprecedented control and precision. Our
technique thus represents a critical step towards applications such as precision 
molecular spectroscopy, stringent tests of fundamental physics, quantum computing
and precision control of molecular dynamics.

The high mountains of Asia-encompassing the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, Karakoram,
Pamir Alai, Kunlun Shan, and Tian Shan mountains-have the highest concentration
of glaciers globally, and 800 million people depend in part on meltwater from
them. Water stress makes this region vulnerable economically and socially to
drought, but glaciers are a uniquely drought-resilient source of water. Here I
show that these glaciers provide summer meltwater to rivers and aquifers that is 
sufficient for the basic needs of 136 million people, or most of the annual
municipal and industrial needs of Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan 
and Kyrgyzstan. During drought summers, meltwater dominates water inputs to the
upper Indus and Aral river basins. Uncertainties in mountain precipitation are
poorly known, but, given the magnitude of this water supply, predicted glacier
loss would add considerably to drought-related water stress. Such additional
water stress increases the risk of social instability, conflict and sudden,
uncontrolled population migrations triggered by water scarcity, which is already 
associated with the large and rapidly growing populations and hydro-economies of 
these basins.

The Jovian moon Io hosts the most powerful persistently active volcano in the
Solar System, Loki Patera. The interior of this volcanic, caldera-like feature is
composed of a warm, dark floor covering 21,500 square kilometres surrounding a
much cooler central 'island'. The temperature gradient seen across areas of the
patera indicates a systematic resurfacing process, which has been seen to occur
typically every one to three years since the 1980s. Analysis of past data has
indicated that the resurfacing progressed around the patera in an anti-clockwise 
direction at a rate of one to two kilometres per day, and that it is caused
either by episodic eruptions that emplace voluminous lava flows or by a
cyclically overturning lava lake contained within the patera. However, spacecraft
and telescope observations have been unable to map the emission from the entire
patera floor at sufficient spatial resolution to establish the physical processes
at play. Here we report temperature and lava cooling age maps of the entire
patera floor at a spatial sampling of about two kilometres, derived from
ground-based interferometric imaging of thermal emission from Loki Patera
obtained on 8 March 2015 ut as the limb of Europa occulted Io. Our results
indicate that Loki Patera is resurfaced by a multi-phase process in which two
waves propagate and converge around the central island. The different velocities 
and start times of the waves indicate a non-uniformity in the lava gas content
and/or crust bulk density across the patera.

The development of the nervous system involves a coordinated succession of events
including the migration of GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) neurons from
ventral to dorsal forebrain and their integration into cortical circuits.
However, these interregional interactions have not yet been modelled with human
cells. Here we generate three-dimensional spheroids from human pluripotent stem
cells that resemble either the dorsal or ventral forebrain and contain cortical
glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids 
can be assembled in vitro to recapitulate the saltatory migration of interneurons
observed in the fetal forebrain. Using this system, we find that in Timothy
syndrome-a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the CaV1.2 
calcium channel-interneurons display abnormal migratory saltations. We also show 
that after migration, interneurons functionally integrate with glutamatergic
neurons to form a microphysiological system. We anticipate that this approach
will be useful for studying neural development and disease, and for deriving
spheroids that resemble other brain regions to assemble circuits in vitro.

Retracing the evolutionary history of arthropods has been one of the greatest
challenges in biology. During the past decade, phylogenetic analyses of
morphological and molecular data have coalesced towards the conclusion that
Mandibulata, the most diverse and abundant group of animals, is a distinct clade 
from Chelicerata, in that its members possess post-oral head appendages
specialized for food processing, notably the mandible. The origin of the
mandibulate body plan, however, which encompasses myriapods, crustaceans and
hexapods, has remained poorly documented. Here we show that Tokummia katalepsis
gen. et sp. nov., a large bivalved arthropod from the 508 million-year-old Marble
Canyon fossil deposit (Burgess Shale, British Columbia), has unequivocal
mandibulate synapomorphies, including mandibles and maxillipeds, as well as
characters typically found in crustaceans, such as enditic, subdivided basipods
and ring-shaped trunk segments. Tokummia and its closest relative, Branchiocaris 
(in Protocarididae, emended), also have an anteriormost structure housing a
probable bilobed organ, which could support the appendicular origin of the
labrum. Protocaridids are retrieved with Canadaspis and Odaraia (in Hymenocarina,
emended) as part of an expanded mandibulate clade, refuting the idea that these
problematic bivalved taxa, as well as other related forms, are representatives of
the basalmost euarthropods. Hymenocarines now illustrate that the subdivision of 
the basipod and the presence of proximal endites are likely to have been
ancestral conditions critical for the evolution of coxal and pre-coxal features
in mandibulates. The presence of crustaceomorph traits in the Cambrian larvae of 
various clades basal to Mandibulata is reinterpreted as evidence for the
existence of distinct ontogenetic niches among stem arthropods. Larvae would
therefore have constituted an important source of morphological novelty during
the Cambrian period, and, through heterochronic processes, may have contributed
to the rapid acquisition of crown-group characters and thus to greater
evolutionary rates during the early radiation of euarthropods.

In vitro models of the developing brain such as three-dimensional brain organoids
offer an unprecedented opportunity to study aspects of human brain development
and disease. However, the cells generated within organoids and the extent to
which they recapitulate the regional complexity, cellular diversity and circuit
functionality of the brain remain undefined. Here we analyse gene expression in
over 80,000 individual cells isolated from 31 human brain organoids. We find that
organoids can generate a broad diversity of cells, which are related to
endogenous classes, including cells from the cerebral cortex and the retina.
Organoids could be developed over extended periods (more than 9 months), allowing
for the establishment of relatively mature features, including the formation of
dendritic spines and spontaneously active neuronal networks. Finally, neuronal
activity within organoids could be controlled using light stimulation of
photosensitive cells, which may offer a way to probe the functionality of human
neuronal circuits using physiological sensory stimuli.

The relative contribution of the effector molecules produced by T cells to tumour
rejection is unclear, but interferon-γ (IFNγ) is critical in most of the analysed
models. Although IFNγ can impede tumour growth by acting directly on cancer
cells, it must also act on the tumour stroma for effective rejection of large,
established tumours. However, which stroma cells respond to IFNγ and by which
mechanism IFNγ contributes to tumour rejection through stromal targeting have
remained unknown. Here we use a model of IFNγ induction and an IFNγ-GFP fusion
protein in large, vascularized tumours growing in mice that express the IFNγ
receptor exclusively in defined cell types. Responsiveness to IFNγ by myeloid
cells and other haematopoietic cells, including T cells or fibroblasts, was not
sufficient for IFNγ-induced tumour regression, whereas responsiveness of
endothelial cells to IFNγ was necessary and sufficient. Intravital microscopy
revealed IFNγ-induced regression of the tumour vasculature, resulting in arrest
of blood flow and subsequent collapse of tumours, similar to non-haemorrhagic
necrosis in ischaemia and unlike haemorrhagic necrosis induced by tumour necrosis
factor. The early events of IFNγ-induced tumour ischaemia resemble non-apoptotic 
blood vessel regression during development, wound healing or IFNγ-mediated,
pregnancy-induced remodelling of uterine arteries. A better mechanistic
understanding of how solid tumours are rejected may aid the design of more
effective protocols for adoptive T-cell therapy.

Nine neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)
tracts in different proteins, such as huntingtin in Huntington's disease and
ataxin 3 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Age at onset of disease
decreases with increasing polyglutamine length in these proteins and the normal
length also varies. PolyQ expansions drive pathogenesis in these diseases, as
isolated polyQ tracts are toxic, and an N-terminal huntingtin fragment comprising
exon 1, which occurs in vivo as a result of alternative splicing, causes
toxicity. Although such mutant proteins are prone to aggregation, toxicity is
also associated with soluble forms of the proteins. The function of the polyQ
tracts in many normal cytoplasmic proteins is unclear. One such protein is the
deubiquitinating enzyme ataxin 3 (refs 7, 8), which is widely expressed in the
brain. Here we show that the polyQ domain enables wild-type ataxin 3 to interact 
with beclin 1, a key initiator of autophagy. This interaction allows the
deubiquitinase activity of ataxin 3 to protect beclin 1 from proteasome-mediated 
degradation and thereby enables autophagy. Starvation-induced autophagy, which is
regulated by beclin 1, was particularly inhibited in ataxin-3-depleted human cell
lines and mouse primary neurons, and in vivo in mice. This activity of ataxin 3
and its polyQ-mediated interaction with beclin 1 was competed for by other
soluble proteins with polyQ tracts in a length-dependent fashion. This
competition resulted in impairment of starvation-induced autophagy in cells
expressing mutant huntingtin exon 1, and this impairment was recapitulated in the
brains of a mouse model of Huntington's disease and in cells from patients. A
similar phenomenon was also seen with other polyQ disease proteins, including
mutant ataxin 3 itself. Our data thus describe a specific function for a
wild-type polyQ tract that is abrogated by a competing longer polyQ mutation in a
disease protein, and identify a deleterious function of such mutations distinct
from their propensity to aggregate.

Mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) has a central role in both metabolic regulation and
cell death signalling, however its role in homeostatic function and disease is
controversial. Slc8b1 encodes the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), which 
is proposed to be the primary mechanism for mCa2+ extrusion in excitable cells.
Here we show that tamoxifen-induced deletion of Slc8b1 in adult mouse hearts
causes sudden death, with less than 13% of affected mice surviving after 14 days.
Lethality correlated with severe myocardial dysfunction and fulminant heart
failure. Mechanistically, cardiac pathology was attributed to mCa2+ overload
driving increased generation of superoxide and necrotic cell death, which was
rescued by genetic inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
activation. Corroborating these findings, overexpression of NCLX in the mouse
heart by conditional transgenesis had the beneficial effect of augmenting mCa2+
clearance, preventing permeability transition and protecting against
ischaemia-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis and heart failure. These results
demonstrate the essential nature of mCa2+ efflux in cellular function and suggest
that augmenting mCa2+ efflux may be a viable therapeutic strategy in disease.

Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) that are irreversibly activated by proteolytic cleavage of the N
terminus, which unmasks a tethered peptide ligand that binds and activates the
transmembrane receptor domain, eliciting a cellular cascade in response to
inflammatory signals and other stimuli. PARs are implicated in a wide range of
diseases, such as cancer and inflammation. PARs have been the subject of major
pharmaceutical research efforts but the discovery of small-molecule antagonists
that effectively bind them has proved challenging. The only marketed drug
targeting a PAR is vorapaxar, a selective antagonist of PAR1 used to prevent
thrombosis. The structure of PAR1 in complex with vorapaxar has been reported
previously. Despite sequence homology across the PAR isoforms, discovery of PAR2 
antagonists has been less successful, although GB88 has been described as a weak 
antagonist. Here we report crystal structures of PAR2 in complex with two
distinct antagonists and a blocking antibody. The antagonist AZ8838 binds in a
fully occluded pocket near the extracellular surface. Functional and binding
studies reveal that AZ8838 exhibits slow binding kinetics, which is an attractive
feature for a PAR2 antagonist competing against a tethered ligand. Antagonist
AZ3451 binds to a remote allosteric site outside the helical bundle. We propose
that antagonist binding prevents structural rearrangements required for receptor 
activation and signalling. We also show that a blocking antibody antigen-binding 
fragment binds to the extracellular surface of PAR2, preventing access of the
tethered ligand to the peptide-binding site. These structures provide a basis for
the development of selective PAR2 antagonists for a range of therapeutic uses.

Membrane transporters move substrates across the membrane by alternating access
of their binding sites between the opposite sides of the membrane. An emerging
model of this process is the elevator mechanism, in which a substrate-binding
transport domain moves a large distance across the membrane. This mechanism has
been characterized by a transition between two states, but the conformational
path that leads to the transition is not yet known, largely because the available
structural information has been limited to the two end states. Here we present
crystal structures of the inward-facing, intermediate, and outward-facing states 
of a concentrative nucleoside transporter from Neisseria wadsworthii. Notably, we
determined the structures of multiple intermediate conformations, in which the
transport domain is captured halfway through its elevator motion. Our structures 
present a trajectory of the conformational transition in the elevator model,
revealing multiple intermediate steps and state-dependent conformational changes 
within the transport domain that are associated with the elevator-like motion.

The quantum of thermal conductance of ballistic (collisionless) one-dimensional
channels is a unique fundamental constant. Although the quantization of the
electrical conductance of one-dimensional ballistic conductors has long been
experimentally established, demonstrating the quantization of thermal conductance
has been challenging as it necessitated an accurate measurement of very small
temperature increase. It has been accomplished for weakly interacting systems of 
phonons, photons and electronic Fermi liquids; however, it should theoretically
also hold in strongly interacting systems, such as those in which the fractional 
quantum Hall effect is observed. This effect describes the fractionalization of
electrons into anyons and chargeless quasiparticles, which in some cases can be
Majorana fermions. Because the bulk is incompressible in the fractional quantum
Hall regime, it is not expected to contribute substantially to the thermal
conductance, which is instead determined by chiral, one-dimensional edge modes.
The thermal conductance thus reflects the topological properties of the
fractional quantum Hall electronic system, to which measurements of the
electrical conductance give no access. Here we report measurements of thermal
conductance in particle-like (Laughlin-Jain series) states and the more complex
(and less studied) hole-like states in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron
gas in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. Hole-like states, which have fractional
Landau-level fillings of 1/2 to 1, support downstream charged modes as well as
upstream neutral modes, and are expected to have a thermal conductance that is
determined by the net chirality of all of their downstream and upstream edge
modes. Our results establish the universality of the quantization of thermal
conductance for fractionally charged and neutral modes. Measurements of anyonic
heat flow provide access to information that is not easily accessible from
measurements of conductance.

The ability to control electronic states at the nanoscale has contributed to our 
modern understanding of condensed matter. In particular, quantum dot circuits
represent model systems for the study of strong electronic correlations,
epitomized by the Kondo effect. We use circuit quantum electrodynamics
architectures to study the internal degrees of freedom of this many-body
phenomenon. Specifically, we couple a quantum dot to a high-quality-factor
microwave cavity to measure with exceptional sensitivity the dot's electronic
compressibility, that is, its ability to accommodate charges. Because electronic 
compressibility corresponds solely to the charge response of the electronic
system, it is not equivalent to the conductance, which generally involves other
degrees of freedom such as spin. Here, by performing dual conductance and
compressibility measurements in the Kondo regime, we uncover directly the charge 
dynamics of this peculiar mechanism of electron transfer. The Kondo resonance,
visible in transport measurements, is found to be 'transparent' to microwave
photons trapped in the high-quality cavity, thereby revealing that (in such a
many-body resonance) finite conduction is achieved from a charge frozen by
Coulomb interaction. This freezing of charge dynamics is in contrast to the
physics of a free electron gas. We anticipate that the tools of cavity quantum
electrodynamics could be used in other types of mesoscopic circuits with
many-body correlations, providing a model system in which to perform quantum
simulation of fermion-boson problems.

Despite the success of monotherapies based on blockade of programmed cell death 1
(PD-1) in human melanoma, most patients do not experience durable clinical
benefit. Pre-existing T-cell infiltration and/or the presence of PD-L1 in tumours
may be used as indicators of clinical response; however, blood-based profiling to
understand the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade has not been widely explored. Here we 
use immune profiling of peripheral blood from patients with stage IV melanoma
before and after treatment with the PD-1-targeting antibody pembrolizumab and
identify pharmacodynamic changes in circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells
(Tex cells). Most of the patients demonstrated an immunological response to
pembrolizumab. Clinical failure in many patients was not solely due to an
inability to induce immune reinvigoration, but rather resulted from an imbalance 
between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. The magnitude of reinvigoration 
of circulating Tex cells determined in relation to pretreatment tumour burden
correlated with clinical response. By focused profiling of a mechanistically
relevant circulating T-cell subpopulation calibrated to pretreatment disease
burden, we identify a clinically accessible potential on-treatment predictor of
response to PD-1 blockade.

It is not easy to fabricate materials that exhibit their theoretical 'ideal'
strength. Most methods of producing stronger materials are based on controlling
defects to impede the motion of dislocations, but such methods have their
limitations. For example, industrial single-phase nanocrystalline alloys and
single-phase metallic glasses can be very strong, but they typically soften at
relatively low strains (less than two per cent) because of, respectively, the
reverse Hall-Petch effect and shear-band formation. Here we describe an approach 
that combines the strengthening benefits of nanocrystallinity with those of
amorphization to produce a dual-phase material that exhibits near-ideal strength 
at room temperature and without sample size effects. Our magnesium-alloy system
consists of nanocrystalline cores embedded in amorphous glassy shells, and the
strength of the resulting dual-phase material is a near-ideal 3.3
gigapascals-making this the strongest magnesium-alloy thin film yet achieved. We 
propose a mechanism, supported by constitutive modelling, in which the
crystalline phase (consisting of almost-dislocation-free grains of around
six nanometres in diameter) blocks the propagation of localized shear bands when 
under strain; moreover, within any shear bands that do appear, embedded
crystalline grains divide and rotate, contributing to hardening and countering
the softening effect of the shear band.

During epithelial cytokinesis, the remodelling of adhesive cell-cell contacts
between the dividing cell and its neighbours has profound implications for the
integrity, arrangement and morphogenesis of proliferative tissues. In both
vertebrates and invertebrates, this remodelling requires the activity of
non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) in the interphasic cells neighbouring the dividing
cell. However, the mechanisms that coordinate cytokinesis and MyoII activity in
the neighbours are unknown. Here we show that in the Drosophila notum epithelium,
each cell division is associated with a mechanosensing and transmission event
that controls MyoII dynamics in neighbouring cells. We find that the ring pulling
forces promote local junction elongation, which results in local E-cadherin
dilution at the ingressing adherens junction. In turn, the reduction in
E-cadherin concentration and the contractility of the neighbouring cells promote 
self-organized actomyosin flows, ultimately leading to accumulation of MyoII at
the base of the ingressing junction. Although force transduction has been
extensively studied in the context of adherens junction reinforcement to
stabilize adhesive cell-cell contacts, we propose an alternative mechanosensing
mechanism that coordinates actomyosin dynamics between epithelial cells and
sustains the remodelling of the adherens junction in response to mechanical
forces.

Between about 1998 and 2012, a time that coincided with political negotiations
for preventing climate change, the surface of Earth seemed hardly to warm. This
phenomenon, often termed the 'global warming hiatus', caused doubt in the public 
mind about how well anthropogenic climate change and natural variability are
understood. Here we show that apparently contradictory conclusions stem from
different definitions of 'hiatus' and from different datasets. A combination of
changes in forcing, uptake of heat by the oceans, natural variability and
incomplete observational coverage reconciles models and data. Combined with
stronger recent warming trends in newer datasets, we are now more confident than 
ever that human influence is dominant in long-term warming.

Catalytic carbon-carbon bond formation has enabled the streamlining of synthetic 
routes when assembling complex molecules. It is particularly important when
incorporating saturated hydrocarbons, which are common motifs in petrochemicals
and biologically relevant molecules. However, cross-coupling methods that involve
alkyl electrophiles result in catalytic bond formation only at specific and
previously functionalized sites. Here we describe a catalytic method that is
capable of promoting carboxylation reactions at remote and unfunctionalized
aliphatic sites with carbon dioxide at atmospheric pressure. The reaction occurs 
via selective migration of the catalyst along the hydrocarbon side-chain with
excellent regio- and chemoselectivity, representing a remarkable reactivity relay
when compared with classical cross-coupling reactions. Our results demonstrate
that site-selectivity can be switched and controlled, enabling the
functionalization of less-reactive positions in the presence of a priori more
reactive ones. Furthermore, we show that raw materials obtained in bulk from
petroleum processing, such as alkanes and unrefined mixtures of olefins, can be
used as substrates. This offers an opportunity to integrate a catalytic platform 
en route to valuable fatty acids by transforming petroleum-derived feedstocks
directly.

Mammalian genomes are spatially organized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and
cohesin into chromatin loops and topologically associated domains, which have
important roles in gene regulation and recombination. By binding to specific
sequences, CTCF defines contact points for cohesin-mediated long-range
chromosomal cis-interactions. Cohesin is also present at these sites, but has
been proposed to be loaded onto DNA elsewhere and to extrude chromatin loops
until it encounters CTCF bound to DNA. How cohesin is recruited to CTCF sites,
according to this or other models, is unknown. Here we show that the distribution
of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin
release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl). In CTCF-depleted fibroblasts, cohesin
cannot be properly recruited to CTCF sites but instead accumulates at
transcription start sites of active genes, where the cohesin-loading complex is
located. In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70
kilobase-long regions at 3'-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge
on each other. Changing gene expression modulates the position of these 'cohesin 
islands'. These findings indicate that transcription can relocate mammalian
cohesin over long distances on DNA, as previously reported for yeast cohesin,
that this translocation contributes to positioning cohesin at CTCF sites, and
that active genes can be freed from cohesin either by transcription-mediated
translocation or by Wapl-mediated release.

Chromatin remodellers are helicase-like, ATP-dependent enzymes that alter
chromatin structure and nucleosome positions to allow regulatory proteins access 
to DNA. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of chromatin
remodeller Switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI2/SNF2) from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae bound to the nucleosome. The structure shows that the two core domains
of Snf2 are realigned upon nucleosome binding, suggesting activation of the
enzyme. The core domains contact each other through two induced Brace helices,
which are crucial for coupling ATP hydrolysis to chromatin remodelling. Snf2
binds to the phosphate backbones of one DNA gyre of the nucleosome mainly through
its helicase motifs within the major domain cleft, suggesting a conserved
mechanism of substrate engagement across different remodellers. Snf2 contacts the
second DNA gyre via a positively charged surface, providing a mechanism to anchor
the remodeller at a fixed position of the nucleosome. Snf2 locally deforms
nucleosomal DNA at the site of binding, priming the substrate for the remodelling
reaction. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into chromatin
remodelling.

Parental care is essential for the survival of mammals, yet the mechanisms
underlying its evolution remain largely unknown. Here we show that two sister
species of mice, Peromyscus polionotus and Peromyscus maniculatus, have large and
heritable differences in parental behaviour. Using quantitative genetics, we
identify 12 genomic regions that affect parental care, 8 of which have
sex-specific effects, suggesting that parental care can evolve independently in
males and females. Furthermore, some regions affect parental care broadly,
whereas others affect specific behaviours, such as nest building. Of the genes
linked to differences in nest-building behaviour, vasopressin is differentially
expressed in the hypothalamus of the two species, with increased levels
associated with less nest building. Using pharmacology in Peromyscus and
chemogenetics in Mus, we show that vasopressin inhibits nest building but not
other parental behaviours. Together, our results indicate that variation in an
ancient neuropeptide contributes to interspecific differences in parental care.

Cancer cells elude anti-tumour immunity through multiple mechanisms, including
upregulated expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors.
Phagocytosis by macrophages plays a critical role in cancer control. Therapeutic 
blockade of signal regulatory protein (SIRP)-α, an inhibitory receptor on
macrophages, or of its ligand CD47 expressed on tumour cells, improves tumour
cell elimination in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that blockade of the SIRPα-CD47
checkpoint could be useful in treating human cancer. However, the pro-phagocytic 
receptor(s) responsible for tumour cell phagocytosis is(are) largely unknown.
Here we find that macrophages are much more efficient at phagocytosis of
haematopoietic tumour cells, compared with non-haematopoietic tumour cells, in
response to SIRPα-CD47 blockade. Using a mouse lacking the signalling lymphocytic
activation molecule (SLAM) family of homotypic haematopoietic cell-specific
receptors, we determined that phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells during 
SIRPα-CD47 blockade was strictly dependent on SLAM family receptors in vitro and 
in vivo. In both mouse and human cells, this function required a single SLAM
family member, SLAMF7 (also known as CRACC, CS1, CD319), expressed on macrophages
and tumour cell targets. In contrast to most SLAM receptor functions,
SLAMF7-mediated phagocytosis was independent of signalling lymphocyte activation 
molecule-associated protein (SAP) adaptors. Instead, it depended on the ability
of SLAMF7 to interact with integrin Mac-1 (refs 18, 19, 20) and utilize signals
involving immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. These findings
elucidate the mechanism by which macrophages engulf and destroy haematopoietic
tumour cells. They also reveal a novel SAP adaptor-independent function for a
SLAM receptor. Lastly, they suggest that patients with tumours expressing SLAMF7 
are more likely to respond to SIRPα-CD47 blockade therapy.

Human members of the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) family of transporters take up
excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain and amino acids in peripheral organs.
Dysregulation of the function of SLC1 transporters is associated with
neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Here we present crystal structures of a
thermostabilized human SLC1 transporter, the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 
(EAAT1), with and without allosteric and competitive inhibitors bound. The
structures reveal architectural features of the human transporters, such as
intra- and extracellular domains that have potential roles in transport function,
regulation by lipids and post-translational modifications. The coordination of
the allosteric inhibitor in the structures and the change in the transporter
dynamics measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveal a
mechanism of inhibition, in which the transporter is locked in the outward-facing
states of the transport cycle. Our results provide insights into the molecular
mechanisms underlying the function and pharmacology of human SLC1 transporters.

The ability to visualize directly a large number of distinct molecular species
inside cells is increasingly essential for understanding complex systems and
processes. Even though existing methods have successfully been used to explore
structure-function relationships in nervous systems, to profile RNA in situ, to
reveal the heterogeneity of tumour microenvironments and to study dynamic
macromolecular assembly, it remains challenging to image many species with high
selectivity and sensitivity under biological conditions. For instance,
fluorescence microscopy faces a 'colour barrier', owing to the intrinsically
broad (about 1,500 inverse centimetres) and featureless nature of fluorescence
spectra that limits the number of resolvable colours to two to five (or seven to 
nine if using complicated instrumentation and analysis). Spontaneous Raman
microscopy probes vibrational transitions with much narrower resonances (peak
width of about 10 inverse centimetres) and so does not suffer from this problem, 
but weak signals make many bio-imaging applications impossible. Although
surface-enhanced Raman scattering offers high sensitivity and multiplicity, it
cannot be readily used to image specific molecular targets quantitatively inside 
live cells. Here we use stimulated Raman scattering under electronic
pre-resonance conditions to image target molecules inside living cells with very 
high vibrational selectivity and sensitivity (down to 250 nanomolar with a time
constant of 1 millisecond). We create a palette of triple-bond-conjugated
near-infrared dyes that each displays a single peak in the cell-silent Raman
spectral window; when combined with available fluorescent probes, this palette
provides 24 resolvable colours, with the potential for further expansion.
Proof-of-principle experiments on neuronal co-cultures and brain tissues reveal
cell-type-dependent heterogeneities in DNA and protein metabolism under
physiological and pathological conditions, underscoring the potential of this
24-colour (super-multiplex) optical imaging approach for elucidating intricate
interactions in complex biological systems.

Ageing drives changes in neuronal and cognitive function, the decline of which is
a major feature of many neurological disorders. The hippocampus, a brain region
subserving roles of spatial and episodic memory and learning, is sensitive to the
detrimental effects of ageing at morphological and molecular levels. With
advancing age, synapses in various hippocampal subfields exhibit impaired
long-term potentiation, an electrophysiological correlate of learning and memory.
At the molecular level, immediate early genes are among the synaptic plasticity
genes that are both induced by long-term potentiation and downregulated in the
aged brain. In addition to revitalizing other aged tissues, exposure to factors
in young blood counteracts age-related changes in these central nervous system
parameters, although the identities of specific cognition-promoting factors or
whether such activity exists in human plasma remains unknown. We hypothesized
that plasma of an early developmental stage, namely umbilical cord plasma,
provides a reservoir of such plasticity-promoting proteins. Here we show that
human cord plasma treatment revitalizes the hippocampus and improves cognitive
function in aged mice. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), a
blood-borne factor enriched in human cord plasma, young mouse plasma, and young
mouse hippocampi, appears in the brain after systemic administration and
increases synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognition in aged mice.
Depletion experiments in aged mice revealed TIMP2 to be necessary for the
cognitive benefits conferred by cord plasma. We find that systemic pools of TIMP2
are necessary for spatial memory in young mice, while treatment of brain slices
with TIMP2 antibody prevents long-term potentiation, arguing for previously
unknown roles for TIMP2 in normal hippocampal function. Our findings reveal that 
human cord plasma contains plasticity-enhancing proteins of high translational
value for targeting ageing- or disease-associated hippocampal dysfunction.

The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established, but
the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the
scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives
of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies or are known from poorly
preserved or incomplete material. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically
lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage
(Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle
Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites
several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, 
Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and
birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We
demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize
Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the
bird-crocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the
crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and
early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more
species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than 
previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were
previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent
specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology.

Vaccine-induced high-avidity IgA can protect against bacterial enteropathogens by
directly neutralizing virulence factors or by poorly defined mechanisms that
physically impede bacterial interactions with the gut tissues ('immune
exclusion'). IgA-mediated cross-linking clumps bacteria in the gut lumen and is
critical for protection against infection by non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica
subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). However, classical
agglutination, which was thought to drive this process, is efficient only at high
pathogen densities (≥108 non-motile bacteria per gram). In typical infections,
much lower densities (100-107 colony-forming units per gram) of rapidly dividing 
bacteria are present in the gut lumen. Here we show that a different physical
process drives formation of clumps in vivo: IgA-mediated cross-linking enchains
daughter cells, preventing their separation after division, and clumping is
therefore dependent on growth. Enchained growth is effective at all realistic
pathogen densities, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the gut lumen.
Furthermore, IgA enchains plasmid-donor and -recipient clones into separate
clumps, impeding conjugative plasmid transfer in vivo. Enchained growth is
therefore a mechanism by which IgA can disarm and clear potentially invasive
species from the intestinal lumen without requiring high pathogen densities,
inflammation or bacterial killing. Furthermore, our results reveal an untapped
potential for oral vaccines in combating the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

Next-generation high-performance structural materials are required for
lightweight design strategies and advanced energy applications. Maraging steels, 
combining a martensite matrix with nanoprecipitates, are a class of high-strength
materials with the potential for matching these demands. Their outstanding
strength originates from semi-coherent precipitates, which unavoidably exhibit a 
heterogeneous distribution that creates large coherency strains, which in turn
may promote crack initiation under load. Here we report a counterintuitive
strategy for the design of ultrastrong steel alloys by high-density
nanoprecipitation with minimal lattice misfit. We found that these highly
dispersed, fully coherent precipitates (that is, the crystal lattice of the
precipitates is almost the same as that of the surrounding matrix), showing very 
low lattice misfit with the matrix and high anti-phase boundary energy,
strengthen alloys without sacrificing ductility. Such low lattice misfit
(0.03 ± 0.04 per cent) decreases the nucleation barrier for precipitation, thus
enabling and stabilizing nanoprecipitates with an extremely high number density
(more than 1024 per cubic metre) and small size (about 2.7 ± 0.2 nanometres). The
minimized elastic misfit strain around the particles does not contribute much to 
the dislocation interaction, which is typically needed for strength increase.
Instead, our strengthening mechanism exploits the chemical ordering effect that
creates backstresses (the forces opposing deformation) when precipitates are cut 
by dislocations. We create a class of steels, strengthened by Ni(Al,Fe)
precipitates, with a strength of up to 2.2 gigapascals and good ductility (about 
8.2 per cent). The chemical composition of the precipitates enables a substantial
reduction in cost compared to conventional maraging steels owing to the
replacement of the essential but high-cost alloying elements cobalt and titanium 
with inexpensive and lightweight aluminium. Strengthening of this class of steel 
alloy is based on minimal lattice misfit to achieve maximal precipitate
dispersion and high cutting stress (the stress required for dislocations to cut
through coherent precipitates and thus produce plastic deformation), and we
envisage that this lattice misfit design concept may be applied to many other
metallic alloys.

Understanding and predicting crystal growth is fundamental to the control of
functionality in modern materials. Despite investigations for more than one
hundred years, it is only recently that the molecular intricacies of these
processes have been revealed by scanning probe microscopy. To organize and
understand this large amount of new information, new rules for crystal growth
need to be developed and tested. However, because of the complexity and variety
of different crystal systems, attempts to understand crystal growth in detail
have so far relied on developing models that are usually applicable to only one
system. Such models cannot be used to achieve the wide scope of understanding
that is required to create a unified model across crystal types and crystal
structures. Here we describe a general approach to understanding and, in theory, 
predicting the growth of a wide range of crystal types, including the
incorporation of defect structures, by simultaneous molecular-scale simulation of
crystal habit and surface topology using a unified kinetic three-dimensional
partition model. This entails dividing the structure into 'natural tiles' or
Voronoi polyhedra that are metastable and, consequently, temporally persistent.
As such, these units are then suitable for re-construction of the crystal via a
Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the crystal
growth of a diverse set of crystal types, including zeolites, metal-organic
frameworks, calcite, urea and l-cystine.

The earliest dispersal of humans into North America is a contentious subject, and
proposed early sites are required to meet the following criteria for acceptance: 
(1) archaeological evidence is found in a clearly defined and undisturbed
geologic context; (2) age is determined by reliable radiometric dating; (3)
multiple lines of evidence from interdisciplinary studies provide consistent
results; and (4) unquestionable artefacts are found in primary context. Here we
describe the Cerutti Mastodon (CM) site, an archaeological site from the early
late Pleistocene epoch, where in situ hammerstones and stone anvils occur in
spatio-temporal association with fragmentary remains of a single mastodon (Mammut
americanum). The CM site contains spiral-fractured bone and molar fragments,
indicating that breakage occured while fresh. Several of these fragments also
preserve evidence of percussion. The occurrence and distribution of bone, molar
and stone refits suggest that breakage occurred at the site of burial. Five large
cobbles (hammerstones and anvils) in the CM bone bed display use-wear and impact 
marks, and are hydraulically anomalous relative to the low-energy context of the 
enclosing sandy silt stratum. 230Th/U radiometric analysis of multiple bone
specimens using diffusion-adsorption-decay dating models indicates a burial date 
of 130.7 ± 9.4 thousand years ago. These findings confirm the presence of an
unidentified species of Homo at the CM site during the last interglacial period
(MIS 5e; early late Pleistocene), indicating that humans with manual dexterity
and the experiential knowledge to use hammerstones and anvils processed mastodon 
limb bones for marrow extraction and/or raw material for tool production.
Systematic proboscidean bone reduction, evident at the CM site, fits within a
broader pattern of Palaeolithic bone percussion technology in Africa, Eurasia and
North America. The CM site is, to our knowledge, the oldest in situ,
well-documented archaeological site in North America and, as such, substantially 
revises the timing of arrival of Homo into the Americas.

Abrasion-set limits on Himalayan gravel flux.

Rivers sourced in the Himalayan mountain range carry some of the largest sediment
loads on the planet, yet coarse gravel in these rivers vanishes within
approximately 10-40 kilometres on entering the Ganga Plain (the part of the North
Indian River Plain containing the Ganges River). Understanding the fate of gravel
is important for forecasting the response of rivers to large influxes of sediment
triggered by earthquakes or storms. Rapid increase in gravel flux and subsequent 
channel bed aggradation (that is, sediment deposition by a river) following the
1999 Chi-Chi and 2008 Wenchuan earthquakes reduced channel capacity and increased
flood inundation. Here we present an analysis of fan geometry, sediment grain
size and lithology in the Ganga Basin. We find that the gravel fluxes from rivers
draining the central Himalayan mountains, with upstream catchment areas ranging
from about 350 to 50,000 square kilometres, are comparable. Our results show that
abrasion of gravel during fluvial transport can explain this observation; most of
the gravel sourced more than 100 kilometres upstream is converted into sand by
the time it reaches the Ganga Plain. These findings indicate that
earthquake-induced sediment pulses sourced from the Greater Himalayas, such as
that following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, are unlikely to drive increased gravel
aggradation at the mountain front. Instead, we suggest that the sediment influx
should result in an elevated sand flux, leading to distinct patterns of
aggradation and flood risk in the densely populated, low-relief Ganga Plain.

The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify under global warming, with
studies reporting more frequent extreme rain events in many regions of the world,
and predicting increases in future flood frequency. Such early, predominantly
mid-latitude observations are essential because of shortcomings within climate
models in their depiction of convective rainfall. A globally important group of
intense storms-mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)-poses a particular challenge, 
because they organize dynamically on spatial scales that cannot be resolved by
conventional climate models. Here, we use 35 years of satellite observations from
the West African Sahel to reveal a persistent increase in the frequency of the
most intense MCSs. Sahelian storms are some of the most powerful on the planet,
and rain gauges in this region have recorded a rise in 'extreme' daily rainfall
totals. We find that intense MCS frequency is only weakly related to the
multidecadal recovery of Sahel annual rainfall, but is highly correlated with
global land temperatures. Analysis of trends across Africa reveals that MCS
intensification is limited to a narrow band south of the Sahara desert. During
this period, wet-season Sahelian temperatures have not risen, ruling out the
possibility that rainfall has intensified in response to locally warmer
conditions. On the other hand, the meridional temperature gradient spanning the
Sahel has increased in recent decades, consistent with anthropogenic forcing
driving enhanced Saharan warming. We argue that Saharan warming intensifies
convection within Sahelian MCSs through increased wind shear and changes to the
Saharan air layer. The meridional gradient is projected to strengthen throughout 
the twenty-first century, suggesting that the Sahel will experience particularly 
marked increases in extreme rain. The remarkably rapid intensification of
Sahelian MCSs since the 1980s sheds new light on the response of organized
tropical convection to global warming, and challenges conventional projections
made by general circulation models.

Cereal grasses of the Triticeae tribe have been the major food source in
temperate regions since the dawn of agriculture. Their large genomes are
characterized by a high content of repetitive elements and large pericentromeric 
regions that are virtually devoid of meiotic recombination. Here we present a
high-quality reference genome assembly for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We use
chromosome conformation capture mapping to derive the linear order of sequences
across the pericentromeric space and to investigate the spatial organization of
chromatin in the nucleus at megabase resolution. The composition of genes and
repetitive elements differs between distal and proximal regions. Gene family
analyses reveal lineage-specific duplications of genes involved in the transport 
of nutrients to developing seeds and the mobilization of carbohydrates in grains.
We demonstrate the importance of the barley reference sequence for breeding by
inspecting the genomic partitioning of sequence variation in modern elite
germplasm, highlighting regions vulnerable to genetic erosion.

Magnetically driven eruptions on the Sun, from stellar-scale coronal mass
ejections to small-scale coronal X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet jets, have
frequently been observed to involve the ejection of the highly stressed magnetic 
flux of a filament. Theoretically, these two phenomena have been thought to arise
through very different mechanisms: coronal mass ejections from an ideal
(non-dissipative) process, whereby the energy release does not require a change
in the magnetic topology, as in the kink or torus instability; and coronal jets
from a resistive process involving magnetic reconnection. However, it was
recently concluded from new observations that all coronal jets are driven by
filament ejection, just like large mass ejections. This suggests that the two
phenomena have physically identical origin and hence that a single mechanism may 
be responsible, that is, either mass ejections arise from reconnection, or jets
arise from an ideal instability. Here we report simulations of a coronal jet
driven by filament ejection, whereby a region of highly sheared magnetic field
near the solar surface becomes unstable and erupts. The results show that
magnetic reconnection causes the energy release via 'magnetic breakout'-a
positive-feedback mechanism between filament ejection and reconnection. We
conclude that if coronal mass ejections and jets are indeed of physically
identical origin (although on different spatial scales) then magnetic
reconnection (rather than an ideal process) must also underlie mass ejections,
and that magnetic breakout is a universal model for solar eruptions.

The early detection of relapse following primary surgery for non-small-cell lung 
cancer and the characterization of emerging subclones, which seed metastatic
sites, might offer new therapeutic approaches for limiting tumour recurrence. The
ability to track the evolutionary dynamics of early-stage lung cancer
non-invasively in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has not yet been demonstrated.
Here we use a tumour-specific phylogenetic approach to profile the ctDNA of the
first 100 TRACERx (Tracking Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy 
(Rx)) study participants, including one patient who was also recruited to the
PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) post-mortem study.
We identify independent predictors of ctDNA release and analyse the tumour-volume
detection limit. Through blinded profiling of postoperative plasma, we observe
evidence of adjuvant chemotherapy resistance and identify patients who are very
likely to experience recurrence of their lung cancer. Finally, we show that
phylogenetic ctDNA profiling tracks the subclonal nature of lung cancer relapse
and metastasis, providing a new approach for ctDNA-driven therapeutic studies.

The 2013-2016 West African epidemic caused by the Ebola virus was of
unprecedented magnitude, duration and impact. Here we reconstruct the dispersal, 
proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610
Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5% of the known cases. We test the
association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among
administrative regions, inferring a classic 'gravity' model, with intense
dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of
international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had
already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures
ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread
into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to
substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that
this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of
transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights 
will help to inform interventions in future epidemics.

There are no disease-modifying treatments for adult human neurodegenerative
diseases. Here we test RNA-targeted therapies in two mouse models of
spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant polyglutamine
disease. Both models recreate the progressive adult-onset dysfunction and
degeneration of a neuronal network that are seen in patients, including decreased
firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a decline in motor function. We
developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 gene by screening 152
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The most promising oligonucleotide, ASO7,
downregulated ATXN2 mRNA and protein, which resulted in delayed onset of the SCA2
phenotype. After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection to ATXN2-Q127
mice, ASO7 localized to Purkinje cells, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 expression below
75% for more than 10 weeks without microglial activation, and reduced the levels 
of cerebellar ATXN2. Treatment of symptomatic mice with ASO7 improved motor
function compared to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the
BAC-Q72 SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized protein levels
of several SCA2-related proteins expressed in Purkinje cells, including Rgs8,
Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76 and Fam107b. Notably, the firing frequency of Purkinje 
cells returned to normal even when treatment was initiated more than 12 weeks
after the onset of the motor phenotype in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings support
ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human neurodegenerative diseases.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative
disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis
and death 2-5 years after disease onset. Nearly all patients with ALS have
aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords,
and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS. There are no
effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies,
such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and
RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in 
neurological diseases. Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused 
by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially
slow disease progression. However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2-5%
of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43
itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions. Here
we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves
targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast
and flies, and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene 
increase risk of ALS. We used two independent approaches to test whether
decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43
proteinopathy. First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known
as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of
TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a
more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2
to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment
markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly
all cases of ALS, targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective
therapeutic strategy.

substrates.

The Rad51 (also known as RecA) family of recombinases executes the critical step 
in homologous recombination: the search for homologous DNA to serve as a template
during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although budding yeast
Rad51 has been extensively characterized in vitro, the stringency of its search
and sensitivity to mismatched sequences in vivo remain poorly defined. Here, in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analysed Rad51-dependent break-induced replication
in which the invading DSB end and its donor template share a 108-base-pair
homology region and the donor carries different densities of single-base-pair
mismatches. With every eighth base pair mismatched, repair was about 14% of that 
of completely homologous sequences. With every sixth base pair mismatched, repair
was still more than 5%. Thus, completing break-induced replication in vivo
overcomes the apparent requirement for at least 6-8 consecutive paired bases that
has been inferred from in vitro studies. When recombination occurs without a
protruding nonhomologous 3' tail, the mismatch repair protein Msh2 does not
discourage homeologous recombination. However, when the DSB end contains a 3'
protruding nonhomologous tail, Msh2 promotes the rejection of mismatched
substrates. Mismatch correction of strand invasion heteroduplex DNA is strongly
polar, favouring correction close to the DSB end. Nearly all mismatch correction 
depends on the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase-δ, although the repair
proteins Msh2, Mlh1 and Exo1 influence the extent of correction.

The angiotensin II receptors AT1R and AT2R serve as key components of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. AT1R has a central role in the regulation
of blood pressure, but the function of AT2R is unclear and it has a variety of
reported effects. To identify the mechanisms that underlie the differences in
function and ligand selectivity between these receptors, here we report crystal
structures of human AT2R bound to an AT2R-selective ligand and to an AT1R/AT2R
dual ligand, capturing the receptor in an active-like conformation. Unexpectedly,
helix VIII was found in a non-canonical position, stabilizing the active-like
state, but at the same time preventing the recruitment of G proteins or
β-arrestins, in agreement with the lack of signalling responses in standard
cellular assays. Structure-activity relationship, docking and mutagenesis studies
revealed the crucial interactions for ligand binding and selectivity. Our results
thus provide insights into the structural basis of the distinct functions of the 
angiotensin receptors, and may guide the design of new selective ligands.

Strengthening of synaptic connections by NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate)
receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) shapes neural circuits and
mediates learning and memory. During the induction of NMDA-receptor-dependent
LTP, Ca2+ influx stimulates recruitment of synaptic AMPA
(α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors, thereby
strengthening synapses. How Ca2+ induces the recruitment of AMPA receptors
remains unclear. Here we show that, in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal
CA1 region in mice, blocking postsynaptic expression of both synaptotagmin-1
(Syt1) and synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), but not of either alone, abolished LTP. LTP
was restored by expression of wild-type Syt7 but not of a Ca2+-binding-deficient 
mutant Syt7. Blocking postsynaptic expression of Syt1 and Syt7 did not impair
basal synaptic transmission, reduce levels of synaptic or extrasynaptic AMPA
receptors, or alter other AMPA receptor trafficking events. Moreover, expression 
of dominant-negative mutant Syt1 which inhibits Ca2+-dependent presynaptic
vesicle exocytosis, also blocked Ca2+-dependent postsynaptic AMPA receptor
exocytosis, thereby abolishing LTP. Our results suggest that postsynaptic Syt1
and Syt7 act as redundant Ca2+-sensors for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of AMPA
receptors during LTP, and thereby delineate a simple mechanism for the
recruitment of AMPA receptors that mediates LTP.

Oxetanocin A (OXT-A) is a potent antitumour, antiviral and antibacterial
compound. Biosynthesis of OXT-A has been linked to a plasmid-borne Bacillus
megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here
we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of
OXT-A. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent 
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HD-domain
phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXT-A is derived from a 2'-deoxyadenosine
phosphate in an OxsB-catalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen
atom abstraction from C2'. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically
characterized non-methylating Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. X-ray analysis
of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of
enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members. Overall, this work provides a framework 
for understanding the interplay of AdoMet and Cbl cofactors and expands the
catalytic repertoire of Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzymes.

Recent genomic data have revealed multiple interactions between Neanderthals and 
modern humans, but there is currently little genetic evidence regarding
Neanderthal behaviour, diet, or disease. Here we describe the shotgun-sequencing 
of ancient DNA from five specimens of Neanderthal calcified dental plaque
(calculus) and the characterization of regional differences in Neanderthal
ecology. At Spy cave, Belgium, Neanderthal diet was heavily meat based and
included woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep (mouflon), characteristic of a steppe
environment. In contrast, no meat was detected in the diet of Neanderthals from
El Sidrón cave, Spain, and dietary components of mushrooms, pine nuts, and moss
reflected forest gathering. Differences in diet were also linked to an overall
shift in the oral bacterial community (microbiota) and suggested that meat
consumption contributed to substantial variation within Neanderthal microbiota.
Evidence for self-medication was detected in an El Sidrón Neanderthal with a
dental abscess and a chronic gastrointestinal pathogen (Enterocytozoon bieneusi).
Metagenomic data from this individual also contained a nearly complete genome of 
the archaeal commensal Methanobrevibacter oralis (10.2× depth of coverage)-the
oldest draft microbial genome generated to date, at around 48,000 years old. DNA 
preserved within dental calculus represents a notable source of information about
the behaviour and health of ancient hominin specimens, as well as a unique system
that is useful for the study of long-term microbial evolution.

Meltwater stored in ponds and crevasses can weaken and fracture ice shelves,
triggering their rapid disintegration. This ice-shelf collapse results in an
increased flux of ice from adjacent glaciers and ice streams, thereby raising sea
level globally. However, surface rivers forming on ice shelves could potentially 
export stored meltwater and prevent its destructive effects. Here we present
evidence for persistent active drainage networks-interconnected streams, ponds
and rivers-on the Nansen Ice Shelf in Antarctica that export a large fraction of 
the ice shelf's meltwater into the ocean. We find that active drainage has
exported water off the ice surface through waterfalls and dolines for more than a
century. The surface river terminates in a 130-metre-wide waterfall that can
export the entire annual surface melt over the course of seven days. During
warmer melt seasons, these drainage networks adapt to changing environmental
conditions by remaining active for longer and exporting more water. Similar
networks are present on the ice shelf in front of Petermann Glacier, Greenland,
but other systems, such as on the Larsen C and Amery Ice Shelves, retain surface 
water at present. The underlying reasons for export versus retention remain
unclear. Nonetheless our results suggest that, in a future warming climate,
surface rivers could export melt off the large ice shelves surrounding
Antarctica-contrary to present Antarctic ice-sheet models, which assume that
meltwater is stored on the ice surface where it triggers ice-shelf
disintegration.

M dwarf stars, which have masses less than 60 per cent that of the Sun, make up
75 per cent of the population of the stars in the Galaxy. The atmospheres of
orbiting Earth-sized planets are observationally accessible via transmission
spectroscopy when the planets pass in front of these stars. Statistical results
suggest that the nearest transiting Earth-sized planet in the liquid-water,
habitable zone of an M dwarf star is probably around 10.5 parsecs away. A
temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima Centauri, the closest M
dwarf, but it probably does not transit and its true mass is unknown. Seven
Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star TRAPPIST-1, which is 12
parsecs away, but their masses and, particularly, their densities are poorly
constrained. Here we report observations of LHS 1140b, a planet with a radius of 
1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star (LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We
measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times that of Earth, consistent with a
rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an insolation of 0.46 times that of
Earth, placing it within the liquid-water, habitable zone. With 90 per cent
confidence, we place an upper limit on the orbital eccentricity of 0.29. The
circular orbit is unlikely to be the result of tides and therefore was probably
present at formation. Given its large surface gravity and cool insolation, the
planet may have retained its atmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared 
to the present-day) of its host star in its youth. Because LHS 1140 is nearby,
telescopes currently under construction might be able to search for specific
atmospheric gases in the future.

Epitaxy-the growth of a crystalline material on a substrate-is crucial for the
semiconductor industry, but is often limited by the need for lattice matching
between the two material systems. This strict requirement is relaxed for van der 
Waals epitaxy, in which epitaxy on layered or two-dimensional (2D) materials is
mediated by weak van der Waals interactions, and which also allows facile layer
release from 2D surfaces. It has been thought that 2D materials are the only seed
layers for van der Waals epitaxy. However, the substrates below 2D materials may 
still interact with the layers grown during epitaxy (epilayers), as in the case
of the so-called wetting transparency documented for graphene. Here we show that 
the weak van der Waals potential of graphene cannot completely screen the
stronger potential field of many substrates, which enables epitaxial growth to
occur despite its presence. We use density functional theory calculations to
establish that adatoms will experience remote epitaxial registry with a substrate
through a substrate-epilayer gap of up to nine ångströms; this gap can
accommodate a monolayer of graphene. We confirm the predictions with
homoepitaxial growth of GaAs(001) on GaAs(001) substrates through monolayer
graphene, and show that the approach is also applicable to InP and GaP. The grown
single-crystalline films are rapidly released from the graphene-coated substrate 
and perform as well as conventionally prepared films when incorporated in
light-emitting devices. This technique enables any type of semiconductor film to 
be copied from underlying substrates through 2D materials, and then the resultant
epilayer to be rapidly released and transferred to a substrate of interest. This 
process is particularly attractive in the context of non-silicon electronics and 
photonics, where the ability to re-use the graphene-coated substrates allows
savings on the high cost of non-silicon substrates.

Glass is one of the most important high-performance materials used for scientific
research, in industry and in society, mainly owing to its unmatched optical
transparency, outstanding mechanical, chemical and thermal resistance as well as 
its thermal and electrical insulating properties. However, glasses and especially
high-purity glasses such as fused silica glass are notoriously difficult to
shape, requiring high-temperature melting and casting processes for macroscopic
objects or hazardous chemicals for microscopic features. These drawbacks have
made glasses inaccessible to modern manufacturing technologies such as
three-dimensional printing (3D printing). Using a casting nanocomposite, here we 
create transparent fused silica glass components using stereolithography 3D
printers at resolutions of a few tens of micrometres. The process uses a
photocurable silica nanocomposite that is 3D printed and converted to
high-quality fused silica glass via heat treatment. The printed fused silica
glass is non-porous, with the optical transparency of commercial fused silica
glass, and has a smooth surface with a roughness of a few nanometres. By doping
with metal salts, coloured glasses can be created. This work widens the choice of
materials for 3D printing, enabling the creation of arbitrary macro- and
microstructures in fused silica glass for many applications in both industry and 
academia.

The recent arrival of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans in Europe was followed by
rapid expansion of its geographical distribution and host range, confirming the
unprecedented threat that this chytrid fungus poses to western Palaearctic
amphibians. Mitigating this hazard requires a thorough understanding of the
pathogen's disease ecology that is driving the extinction process. Here, we
monitored infection, disease and host population dynamics in a Belgian fire
salamander (Salamandra salamandra) population for two years immediately after the
first signs of infection. We show that arrival of this chytrid is associated with
rapid population collapse without any sign of recovery, largely due to lack of
increased resistance in the surviving salamanders and a demographic shift that
prevents compensation for mortality. The pathogen adopts a dual transmission
strategy, with environmentally resistant non-motile spores in addition to the
motile spores identified in its sister species B. dendrobatidis. The fungus
retains its virulence not only in water and soil, but also in anurans and less
susceptible urodelan species that function as infection reservoirs. The combined 
characteristics of the disease ecology suggest that further expansion of this
fungus will behave as a 'perfect storm' that is able to rapidly extirpate highly 
susceptible salamander populations across Europe.

Surface meltwater drains across ice sheets, forming melt ponds that can trigger
ice-shelf collapse, acceleration of grounded ice flow and increased sea-level
rise. Numerical models of the Antarctic Ice Sheet that incorporate meltwater's
impact on ice shelves, but ignore the movement of water across the ice surface,
predict a metre of global sea-level rise this century in response to atmospheric 
warming. To understand the impact of water moving across the ice surface a broad 
quantification of surface meltwater and its drainage is needed. Yet, despite
extensive research in Greenland and observations of individual drainage systems
in Antarctica, we have little understanding of Antarctic-wide surface hydrology
or how it will evolve. Here we show widespread drainage of meltwater across the
surface of the ice sheet through surface streams and ponds (hereafter 'surface
drainage') as far south as 85° S and as high as 1,300 metres above sea level. Our
findings are based on satellite imagery from 1973 onwards and aerial photography 
from 1947 onwards. Surface drainage has persisted for decades, transporting water
up to 120 kilometres from grounded ice onto and across ice shelves, feeding vast 
melt ponds up to 80 kilometres long. Large-scale surface drainage could deliver
water to areas of ice shelves vulnerable to collapse, as melt rates increase this
century. While Antarctic surface melt ponds are relatively well documented on
some ice shelves, we have discovered that ponds often form part of widespread,
large-scale surface drainage systems. In a warming climate, enhanced surface
drainage could accelerate future ice-mass loss from Antarctic, potentially via
positive feedbacks between the extent of exposed rock, melting and thinning of
the ice sheet.

The non-essential amino acids serine and glycine are used in multiple anabolic
processes that support cancer cell growth and proliferation (reviewed in ref. 1).
While some cancer cells upregulate de novo serine synthesis, many others rely on 
exogenous serine for optimal growth. Restriction of dietary serine and glycine
can reduce tumour growth in xenograft and allograft models. Here we show that
this observation translates into more clinically relevant autochthonous tumours
in genetically engineered mouse models of intestinal cancer (driven by Apc
inactivation) or lymphoma (driven by Myc activation). The increased survival
following dietary restriction of serine and glycine in these models was further
improved by antagonizing the anti-oxidant response. Disruption of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (using biguanides) led to a complex response that could
improve or impede the anti-tumour effect of serine and glycine starvation.
Notably, Kras-driven mouse models of pancreatic and intestinal cancers were less 
responsive to depletion of serine and glycine, reflecting an ability of activated
Kras to increase the expression of enzymes that are part of the serine synthesis 
pathway and thus promote de novo serine synthesis.

In fisheries, the tragedy of the commons manifests as a competitive race to fish 
that compresses fishing seasons, resulting in ecological damage, economic waste, 
and occupational hazards. Catch shares are hypothesized to halt the race by
securing each individual's right to a portion of the total catch, but there is
evidence for this from selected examples only. Here we systematically analyse
natural experiments to test whether catch shares reduce racing in 39 US
fisheries. We compare each fishery treated with catch shares to an individually
matched control before and after the policy change. We estimate an average policy
treatment effect in a pooled model and in a meta-analysis that combines separate 
estimates for each treatment-control pair. Consistent with the theory that
market-based management ends the race to fish, we find strong evidence that catch
shares extend fishing seasons. This evidence informs the current debate over
expanding the use of market-based regulation to other fisheries.

Chromatin and metabolic states both influence lifespan, but how they interact in 
lifespan regulation is largely unknown. The COMPASS chromatin complex, which
trimethylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), regulates lifespan in
Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the mechanism by which H3K4me3 modifiers affect 
longevity, and whether this mechanism involves metabolic changes, remain unclear.
Here we show that a deficiency in H3K4me3 methyltransferase, which extends
lifespan, promotes fat accumulation in worms with a specific enrichment of
mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). This fat metabolism switch in H3K4me3
methyltransferase-deficient worms is mediated at least in part by the
downregulation of germline targets, including S6 kinase, and by the activation of
an intestinal transcriptional network that upregulates delta-9 fatty acid
desaturases. Notably, the accumulation of MUFAs is necessary for the lifespan
extension of H3K4me3 methyltransferase-deficient worms, and dietary MUFAs are
sufficient to extend lifespan. Given the conservation of lipid metabolism,
dietary or endogenous MUFAs could extend lifespan and healthspan in other
species, including mammals.

    Nat Rev Neurosci. 2017 Jun;18(6):323.

Normal differentiation and induced reprogramming require the activation of target
cell programs and silencing of donor cell programs. In reprogramming, the same
factors are often used to reprogram many different donor cell types. As most
developmental repressors, such as RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and
Groucho (also known as TLE), are considered lineage-specific repressors, it
remains unclear how identical combinations of transcription factors can silence
so many different donor programs. Distinct lineage repressors would have to be
induced in different donor cell types. Here, by studying the reprogramming of
mouse fibroblasts to neurons, we found that the pan neuron-specific transcription
factor Myt1-like (Myt1l) exerts its pro-neuronal function by direct repression of
many different somatic lineage programs except the neuronal program. The
repressive function of Myt1l is mediated via recruitment of a complex containing 
Sin3b by binding to a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain. In agreement 
with its repressive function, the genomic binding sites of Myt1l are similar in
neurons and fibroblasts and are preferentially in an open chromatin
configuration. The Notch signalling pathway is repressed by Myt1l through
silencing of several members, including Hes1. Acute knockdown of Myt1l in the
developing mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting
that Myt1l allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal
development. Depletion of Myt1l in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed
non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function,
indicating that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently
repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. It is now tempting to speculate
that similar 'many-but-one' lineage repressors exist for other cell fates; such
repressors, in combination with lineage-specific activators, would be prime
candidates for use in reprogramming additional cell types.

Animals constantly assess the reliability of learned information to optimize
their behaviour. On retrieval, consolidated long-term memory can be neutralized
by extinction if the learned prediction was inaccurate. Alternatively, retrieved 
memory can be maintained, following a period of reconsolidation during which it
is labile. Although extinction and reconsolidation provide opportunities to
alleviate problematic human memories, we lack a detailed mechanistic
understanding of memory updating. Here we identify neural operations underpinning
the re-evaluation of memory in Drosophila. Reactivation of reward-reinforced
olfactory memory can lead to either extinction or reconsolidation, depending on
prediction accuracy. Each process recruits activity in specific parts of the
mushroom body output network and distinct subsets of reinforcing dopaminergic
neurons. Memory extinction requires output neurons with dendrites in the α and α'
lobes of the mushroom body, which drive negatively reinforcing dopaminergic
neurons that innervate neighbouring zones. The aversive valence of these new
extinction memories neutralizes previously learned odour preference. Memory
reconsolidation requires the γ2α'1 mushroom body output neurons. This pathway
recruits negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons innervating the same
compartment and re-engages positively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons to
reconsolidate the original reward memory. These data establish that recurrent and
hierarchical connectivity between mushroom body output neurons and dopaminergic
neurons enables memory re-evaluation driven by reward-prediction error.

Blockade of angiogenesis can retard tumour growth, but may also paradoxically
increase metastasis. This paradox may be resolved by vessel normalization, which 
involves increased pericyte coverage, improved tumour vessel perfusion, reduced
vascular permeability, and consequently mitigated hypoxia. Although these
processes alter tumour progression, their regulation is poorly understood. Here
we show that type 1 T helper (TH1) cells play a crucial role in vessel
normalization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene expression features
related to vessel normalization correlate with immunostimulatory pathways,
especially T lymphocyte infiltration or activity. To delineate the causal
relationship, we used various mouse models with vessel normalization or T
lymphocyte deficiencies. Although disruption of vessel normalization reduced T
lymphocyte infiltration as expected, reciprocal depletion or inactivation of CD4+
T lymphocytes decreased vessel normalization, indicating a mutually regulatory
loop. In addition, activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by immune checkpoint blockade
increased vessel normalization. TH1 cells that secrete interferon-γ are a major
population of cells associated with vessel normalization. Patient-derived
xenograft tumours growing in immunodeficient mice exhibited enhanced hypoxia
compared to the original tumours in immunocompetent humans, and hypoxia was
reduced by adoptive TH1 transfer. Our findings elucidate an unexpected role of
TH1 cells in vasculature and immune reprogramming. TH1 cells may be a marker and 
a determinant of both immune checkpoint blockade and anti-angiogenesis efficacy.

Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. The structure of a
population can affect which traits evolve. Understanding evolutionary game
dynamics in structured populations remains difficult. Mathematical results are
known for special structures in which all individuals have the same number of
neighbours. The general case, in which the number of neighbours can vary, has
remained open. For arbitrary selection intensity, the problem is in a
computational complexity class that suggests there is no efficient algorithm.
Whether a simple solution for weak selection exists has remained unanswered. Here
we provide a solution for weak selection that applies to any graph or network.
Our method relies on calculating the coalescence times of random walks. We
evaluate large numbers of diverse population structures for their propensity to
favour cooperation. We study how small changes in population structure-graph
surgery-affect evolutionary outcomes. We find that cooperation flourishes most in
societies that are based on strong pairwise ties.

Transient control over the atomic potential-energy landscapes of solids could
lead to new states of matter and to quantum control of nuclear motion on the
timescale of lattice vibrations. Recently developed ultrafast time-resolved
diffraction techniques combine ultrafast temporal manipulation with atomic-scale 
spatial resolution and femtosecond temporal resolution. These advances have
enabled investigations of photo-induced structural changes in bulk solids that
often occur on timescales as short as a few hundred femtoseconds. In contrast,
experiments at surfaces and on single atomic layers such as graphene report
timescales of structural changes that are orders of magnitude longer. This raises
the question of whether the structural response of low-dimensional materials to
femtosecond laser excitation is, in general, limited. Here we show that a
photo-induced transition from the low- to high-symmetry state of a charge density
wave in atomic indium (In) wires supported by a silicon (Si) surface takes place 
within 350 femtoseconds. The optical excitation breaks and creates In-In bonds,
leading to the non-thermal excitation of soft phonon modes, and drives the
structural transition in the limit of critically damped nuclear motion through
coupling of these soft phonon modes to a manifold of surface and interface
phonons that arise from the symmetry breaking at the silicon surface. This
finding demonstrates that carefully tuned electronic excitations can create
non-equilibrium potential energy surfaces that drive structural dynamics at
interfaces in the quantum limit (that is, in a regime in which the nuclear motion
is directed and deterministic). This technique could potentially be used to tune 
the dynamic response of a solid to optical excitation, and has widespread
potential application, for example in ultrafast detectors.

Recent observations have revealed massive galactic molecular outflows that may
have the physical conditions (high gas densities) required to form stars. Indeed,
several recent models predict that such massive outflows may ignite star
formation within the outflow itself. This star-formation mode, in which stars
form with high radial velocities, could contribute to the morphological evolution
of galaxies, to the evolution in size and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal
component of galaxies, and would contribute to the population of high-velocity
stars, which could even escape the galaxy. Such star formation could provide in
situ chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (through 
supernova explosions of young stars on large orbits), and some models also
predict it to contribute substantially to the star-formation rate observed in
distant galaxies. Although there exists observational evidence for star formation
triggered by outflows or jets into their host galaxy, as a consequence of gas
compression, evidence for star formation occurring within galactic outflows is
still missing. Here we report spectroscopic observations that unambiguously
reveal star formation occurring in a galactic outflow at a redshift of 0.0448.
The inferred star-formation rate in the outflow is larger than 15 solar masses
per year. Star formation may also be occurring in other galactic outflows, but
may have been missed by previous observations owing to the lack of adequate
diagnostics.

Electrophilic aromatic substitution is one of the most important and recognizable
classes of organic chemical transformation. Enzymes create the strong
electrophiles that are needed for these highly energetic reactions by using O2,
electrons, and metals or other cofactors. Although the nature of the oxidants
that carry out electrophilic aromatic substitution has been deduced from many
approaches, it has been difficult to determine their structures. Here we show the
structure of a diiron hydroxylase intermediate formed during a reaction with
toluene. Density functional theory geometry optimizations of an active site model
reveal that the intermediate is an arylperoxo Fe2+/Fe3+ species with delocalized 
aryl radical character. The structure suggests that a carboxylate ligand of the
diiron centre may trigger homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond by transferring a
proton from a metal-bound water. Our work provides the spatial and electronic
constraints needed to propose a comprehensive mechanism for diiron enzyme arene
hydroxylation that accounts for many prior experimental results.

Aboriginal Australians represent one of the longest continuous cultural complexes
known. Archaeological evidence indicates that Australia and New Guinea were
initially settled approximately 50 thousand years ago (ka); however, little is
known about the processes underlying the enormous linguistic and phenotypic
diversity within Australia. Here we report 111 mitochondrial genomes
(mitogenomes) from historical Aboriginal Australian hair samples, whose origins
enable us to reconstruct Australian phylogeographic history before European
settlement. Marked geographic patterns and deep splits across the major
mitochondrial haplogroups imply that the settlement of Australia comprised a
single, rapid migration along the east and west coasts that reached southern
Australia by 49-45 ka. After continent-wide colonization, strong regional
patterns developed and these have survived despite substantial climatic and
cultural change during the late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Remarkably, we
find evidence for the continuous presence of populations in discrete geographic
areas dating back to around 50 ka, in agreement with the notable Aboriginal
Australian cultural attachment to their country.

The conserved Mediator co-activator complex has an essential role in the
regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription in all eukaryotes. Understanding
the structure and interactions of Mediator is crucial for determining how the
complex influences transcription initiation and conveys regulatory information to
the basal transcription machinery. Here we present a 4.4 Å resolution
cryo-electron microscopy map of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mediator in which
conserved Mediator subunits are individually resolved. The essential Med14
subunit works as a central backbone that connects the Mediator head, middle and
tail modules. Comparison with a 7.8 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of 
a Mediator-RNA polymerase II holoenzyme reveals that changes in the structure of 
Med14 facilitate a large-scale Mediator rearrangement that is essential for
holoenzyme formation. Our study suggests that access to different conformations
and crosstalk between structural elements are essential for the Mediator
regulation mechanism, and could explain the capacity of the complex to integrate 
multiple regulatory signals.

A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the
human genome. Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene 
in humans and phenotypic analysis of such 'human knockouts' can provide insight
into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring 
carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates 
are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult
participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS),
designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in
individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous
predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis
involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare
(<1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated
to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF
mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble
lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma
interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of
apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with
markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with
mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3
has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3
homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and
challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the
mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the
usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations
provide a roadmap for a 'human knockout project', a systematic effort to
understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans.

In vertebrates, skin colour patterns emerge from nonlinear dynamical microscopic 
systems of cell interactions. Here we show that in ocellated lizards a
quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore
cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We
analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their
development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton
(a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based
on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour
states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding
macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical
derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges
from a continuous Turing reaction-diffusion system. Skin thickness variation
generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying
reaction-diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial
scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that
cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly
correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets under Agenda 2030 of 
the United Nations map a coherent global sustainability ambition at a level of
detail general enough to garner consensus amongst nations. However, achieving the
global agenda will depend heavily on successful national-scale implementation,
which requires the development of effective science-driven targets tailored to
specific national contexts and supported by strong national governance. Here we
assess the feasibility of achieving multiple SDG targets at the national scale
for the Australian land-sector. We scaled targets to three levels of ambition and
two timeframes, then quantitatively explored the option space for target
achievement under 648 plausible future environmental, socio-economic,
technological and policy pathways using the Land-Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) integrated
land systems model. We show that target achievement is very sensitive to global
efforts to abate emissions, domestic land-use policy, productivity growth rate,
and land-use change adoption behaviour and capacity constraints. Weaker
target-setting ambition resulted in higher achievement but poorer sustainability 
outcomes. Accelerating land-use dynamics after 2030 changed the targets achieved 
by 2050, warranting a longer-term view and greater flexibility in sustainability 
implementation. Simultaneous achievement of multiple targets is rare owing to the
complexity of sustainability target implementation and the pervasive trade-offs
in resource-constrained land systems. Given that hard choices are needed, the
land-sector must first address the essential food/fibre production, biodiversity 
and land degradation components of sustainability via specific policy pathways.
It may also contribute to emissions abatement, water and energy targets by
capitalizing on co-benefits. However, achieving targets relevant to the
land-sector will also require substantial contributions from other sectors such
as clean energy, food systems and water resource management. Nations require
globally coordinated, national-scale, comprehensive, integrated, multi-sectoral
analyses to support national target-setting that prioritizes efficient and
effective sustainability interventions across societies, economies and
environments.

Epithelial tissues (epithelia) remove excess cells through extrusion, preventing 
the accumulation of unnecessary or pathological cells. The extrusion process can 
be triggered by apoptotic signalling, oncogenic transformation and overcrowding
of cells. Despite the important linkage of cell extrusion to developmental,
homeostatic and pathological processes such as cancer metastasis, its underlying 
mechanism and connections to the intrinsic mechanics of the epithelium are
largely unexplored. We approach this problem by modelling the epithelium as an
active nematic liquid crystal (that has a long range directional order), and
comparing numerical simulations to strain rate and stress measurements within
monolayers of MDCK (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells. Here we show that apoptotic
cell extrusion is provoked by singularities in cell alignments in the form of
comet-shaped topological defects. We find a universal correlation between
extrusion sites and positions of nematic defects in the cell orientation field in
different epithelium types. The results confirm the active nematic nature of
epithelia, and demonstrate that defect-induced isotropic stresses are the primary
precursors of mechanotransductive responses in cells, including YAP
(Yes-associated protein) transcription factor activity, caspase-3-mediated cell
death, and extrusions. Importantly, the defect-driven extrusion mechanism depends
on intercellular junctions, because the weakening of cell-cell interactions in an
α-catenin knockdown monolayer reduces the defect size and increases both the
number of defects and extrusion rates, as is also predicted by our model. We
further demonstrate the ability to control extrusion hotspots by geometrically
inducing defects through microcontact printing of patterned monolayers. On the
basis of these results, we propose a mechanism for apoptotic cell extrusion:
spontaneously formed topological defects in epithelia govern cell fate. This will
be important in predicting extrusion hotspots and dynamics in vivo, with
potential applications to tissue regeneration and the suppression of metastasis. 
Moreover, we anticipate that the analogy between the epithelium and active
nematic liquid crystals will trigger further investigations of the link between
cellular processes and the material properties of epithelia.

Cultured stem cells have become a standard platform not only for regenerative
medicine and developmental biology but also for biophysical studies. Yet, the
characterization of cultured stem cells at the level of morphology and of the
macroscopic patterns resulting from cell-to-cell interactions remains largely
qualitative. Here we report on the collective dynamics of cultured murine neural 
progenitor cells (NPCs), which are multipotent stem cells that give rise to cells
in the central nervous system. At low densities, NPCs moved randomly in an
amoeba-like fashion. However, NPCs at high density elongated and aligned their
shapes with one another, gliding at relatively high velocities. Although the
direction of motion of individual cells reversed stochastically along the axes of
alignment, the cells were capable of forming an aligned pattern up to length
scales similar to that of the migratory stream observed in the adult brain. The
two-dimensional order of alignment within the culture showed a liquid-crystalline
pattern containing interspersed topological defects with winding numbers of +1/2 
and -1/2 (half-integer due to the nematic feature that arises from the head-tail 
symmetry of cell-to-cell interaction). We identified rapid cell accumulation at
+1/2 defects and the formation of three-dimensional mounds. Imaging at the
single-cell level around the defects allowed us to quantify the velocity field
and the evolving cell density; cells not only concentrate at +1/2 defects, but
also escape from -1/2 defects. We propose a generic mechanism for the instability
in cell density around the defects that arises from the interplay between the
anisotropic friction and the active force field.

Although many aspects of blood production are well understood, the spatial
organization of myeloid differentiation in the bone marrow remains unknown. Here 
we use imaging to track granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) behaviour in mice
during emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis. In the steady state, we find
individual GMPs scattered throughout the bone marrow. During regeneration, we
observe expanding GMP patches forming defined GMP clusters, which, in turn,
locally differentiate into granulocytes. The timed release of important bone
marrow niche signals (SCF, IL-1β, G-CSF, TGFβ and CXCL4) and activation of an
inducible Irf8 and β-catenin progenitor self-renewal network control the
transient formation of regenerating GMP clusters. In leukaemia, we show that GMP 
clusters are constantly produced owing to persistent activation of the
self-renewal network and a lack of termination cytokines that normally restore
haematopoietic stem-cell quiescence. Our results uncover a previously
unrecognized dynamic behaviour of GMPs in situ, which tunes emergency
myelopoiesis and is hijacked in leukaemia.

Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at
remarkably high frequencies for their size (>800 Hz)and with lower stroke
amplitudes than any other insect group. This shifts weight support away from the 
translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects, as well as by
helicopters and aeroplanes, towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that 
occur when pitching at the end of each half-stroke. Here we report free-flight
mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier-Stokes equations using
computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in
vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated 
flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is
generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There 
are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that
appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused 
by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new
elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid
changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and
they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover,
these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito
wings.

Chromatin is reprogrammed after fertilization to produce a totipotent zygote with
the potential to generate a new organism. The maternal genome inherited from the 
oocyte and the paternal genome provided by sperm coexist as separate haploid
nuclei in the zygote. How these two epigenetically distinct genomes are spatially
organized is poorly understood. Existing chromosome conformation capture-based
methods are not applicable to oocytes and zygotes owing to a paucity of material.
To study three-dimensional chromatin organization in rare cell types, we
developed a single-nucleus Hi-C (high-resolution chromosome conformation capture)
protocol that provides greater than tenfold more contacts per cell than the
previous method. Here we show that chromatin architecture is uniquely reorganized
during the oocyte-to-zygote transition in mice and is distinct in paternal and
maternal nuclei within single-cell zygotes. Features of genomic organization
including compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops are
present in individual oocytes when averaged over the genome, but the presence of 
each feature at a locus varies between cells. At the sub-megabase level, we
observed stochastic clusters of contacts that can occur across TAD boundaries but
average into TADs. Notably, we found that TADs and loops, but not compartments,
are present in zygotic maternal chromatin, suggesting that these are generated by
different mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the global chromatin
organization of zygote nuclei is fundamentally different from that of other
interphase cells. An understanding of this zygotic chromatin 'ground state' could
potentially provide insights into reprogramming cells to a state of totipotency.

Transposable elements are viewed as 'selfish genetic elements', yet they
contribute to gene regulation and genome evolution in diverse ways. More than
half of the human genome consists of transposable elements. Alu elements belong
to the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) family of repetitive elements,
and with over 1 million insertions they make up more than 10% of the human
genome. Despite their abundance and the potential evolutionary advantages they
confer, Alu elements can be mutagenic to the host as they can act as splice
acceptors, inhibit translation of mRNAs and cause genomic instability. Alu
elements are the main targets of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and the formation of
Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC, but the broad
effect of massive secondary structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu elements on 
RNA processing in the nucleus remains unknown. Here we show that DHX9, an
abundant nuclear RNA helicase, binds specifically to inverted-repeat Alu elements
that are transcribed as parts of genes. Loss of DHX9 leads to an increase in the 
number of circular-RNA-producing genes and amount of circular RNAs, translational
repression of reporters containing inverted-repeat Alu elements, and
transcriptional rewiring (the creation of mostly nonsensical novel connections
between exons) of susceptible loci. Biochemical purifications of DHX9 identify
the interferon-inducible isoform of ADAR (p150), but not the constitutively
expressed ADAR isoform (p110), as an RNA-independent interaction partner.
Co-depletion of ADAR and DHX9 augments the double-stranded RNA accumulation
defects, leading to increased circular RNA production, revealing a functional
link between these two enzymes. Our work uncovers an evolutionarily conserved
function of DHX9. We propose that it acts as a nuclear RNA resolvase that
neutralizes the immediate threat posed by transposon insertions and allows these 
elements to evolve as tools for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression.

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems
provide protection against viral and plasmid infection by capturing short DNA
sequences from these invaders and integrating them into the CRISPR locus of the
prokaryotic host. These sequences, known as spacers, are transcribed into short
CRISPR RNA guides that specify the cleavage site of Cas nucleases in the genome
of the invader. It is not known when spacer sequences are acquired during viral
infection. Here, to investigate this, we tracked spacer acquisition in
Staphylococcus aureus cells harbouring a type II CRISPR-Cas9 system after
infection with the staphylococcal bacteriophage ϕ12. We found that new spacers
were acquired immediately after infection preferentially from the cos site, the
viral free DNA end that is first injected into the cell. Analysis of spacer
acquisition after infection with mutant phages demonstrated that most spacers are
acquired during DNA injection, but not during other stages of the viral cycle
that produce free DNA ends, such as DNA replication or packaging. Finally, we
showed that spacers acquired from early-injected genomic regions, which direct
Cas9 cleavage of the viral DNA immediately after infection, provide better
immunity than spacers acquired from late-injected regions. Our results reveal
that CRISPR-Cas systems exploit the phage life cycle to generate a pattern of
spacer acquisition that ensures a successful CRISPR immune response.

The metabolism of carbohydrate polymers drives microbial diversity in the human
gut microbiota. It is unclear, however, whether bacterial consortia or single
organisms are required to depolymerize highly complex glycans. Here we show that 
the gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron uses the most structurally complex
glycan known: the plant pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-II, cleaving all
but 1 of its 21 distinct glycosidic linkages. The deconstruction of
rhamnogalacturonan-II side chains and backbone are coordinated to overcome steric
constraints, and the degradation involves previously undiscovered enzyme families
and catalytic activities. The degradation system informs revision of the current 
structural model of rhamnogalacturonan-II and highlights how individual gut
bacteria orchestrate manifold enzymes to metabolize the most challenging glycan
in the human diet.

Adiponectin receptors (ADIPORs) are integral membrane proteins that control
glucose and lipid metabolism by mediating, at least in part, a cellular
ceramidase activity that catalyses the hydrolysis of ceramide to produce
sphingosine and a free fatty acid (FFA). The crystal structures of the two
receptor subtypes, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, show a similar overall
seven-transmembrane-domain architecture with large unoccupied cavities and a zinc
binding site within the seven transmembrane domain. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which ADIPORs function are not known. Here we describe the crystal 
structure of ADIPOR2 bound to a FFA molecule and show that ADIPOR2 possesses
intrinsic basal ceramidase activity that is enhanced by adiponectin. We also
identify a ceramide binding pose and propose a possible mechanism for the
hydrolytic activity of ADIPOR2 using computational approaches. In molecular
dynamics simulations, the side chains of residues coordinating the zinc rearrange
quickly to promote the nucleophilic attack of a zinc-bound hydroxide ion onto the
ceramide amide carbonyl. Furthermore, we present a revised ADIPOR1 crystal
structure exhibiting a seven-transmembrane-domain architecture that is clearly
distinct from that of ADIPOR2. In this structure, no FFA is observed and the
ceramide binding pocket and putative zinc catalytic site are exposed to the inner
membrane leaflet. ADIPOR1 also possesses intrinsic ceramidase activity, so we
suspect that the two distinct structures may represent key steps in the enzymatic
activity of ADIPORs. The ceramidase activity is low, however, and further studies
will be required to characterize fully the enzymatic parameters and substrate
specificity of ADIPORs. These insights into ADIPOR function will enable the
structure-based design of potent modulators of these clinically relevant enzymes.

Platelets are critical for haemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses,
but the events that lead to mature platelet production remain incompletely
understood. The bone marrow has been proposed to be a major site of platelet
production, although there is indirect evidence that the lungs might also
contribute to platelet biogenesis. Here, by directly imaging the lung
microcirculation in mice, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate
through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that 
release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the
bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow
space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial,
accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million
platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature
megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces 
of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell
deficiency in the bone marrow, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs,
repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and
contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs 
as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable 
haematopoietic potential.

Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) running on hydrogen are
attractive alternative power supplies for a range of applications, with in situ
release of the required hydrogen from a stable liquid offering one way of
ensuring its safe storage and transportation before use. The use of methanol is
particularly interesting in this regard, because it is inexpensive and can reform
itself with water to release hydrogen with a high gravimetric density of 18.8 per
cent by weight. But traditional reforming of methanol steam operates at
relatively high temperatures (200-350 degrees Celsius), so the focus for vehicle 
and portable PEMFC applications has been on aqueous-phase reforming of methanol
(APRM). This method requires less energy, and the simpler and more compact device
design allows direct integration into PEMFC stacks. There remains, however, the
need for an efficient APRM catalyst. Here we report that platinum (Pt) atomically
dispersed on α-molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) enables low-temperature (150-190
degrees Celsius), base-free hydrogen production through APRM, with an average
turnover frequency reaching 18,046 moles of hydrogen per mole of platinum per
hour. We attribute this exceptional hydrogen production-which far exceeds that of
previously reported low-temperature APRM catalysts-to the outstanding ability of 
α-MoC to induce water dissociation, and to the fact that platinum and α-MoC act
in synergy to activate methanol and then to reform it.

The human brain contains approximately 60 billion cerebellar granule cells, which
outnumber all other brain neurons combined. Classical theories posit that a
large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed
representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to
sense fine contextual changes. Although evidence suggests a role for the
cerebellum in cognition, granule cells are known to encode only sensory and motor
context. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that
granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated 
voluntary forelimb movements for delayed sugar-water reward. Some granule cells
responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively
encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb
movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable
rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity
despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals
were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule
cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-anticipating 
responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward
delivery, whereas reward-omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed.
The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a
major departure from the current understanding of these neurons and markedly
enriches the contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells,
with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum.

Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) feature a low degeneracy of electronic states at
the band edges compared with the corresponding bulk material, as well as a narrow
emission linewidth. Unfortunately for potential laser applications, this
degeneracy is incompletely lifted in the valence band, spreading the hole
population among several states at room temperature. This leads to increased
optical gain thresholds, demanding high photoexcitation levels to achieve
population inversion (more electrons in excited states than in ground states-the 
condition for optical gain). This, in turn, increases Auger recombination losses,
limiting the gain lifetime to sub-nanoseconds and preventing steady laser action.
State degeneracy also broadens the photoluminescence linewidth at the
single-particle level. Here we demonstrate a way to decrease the band-edge
degeneracy and single-dot photoluminescence linewidth in CQDs by means of uniform
biaxial strain. We have developed a synthetic strategy that we term
facet-selective epitaxy: we first switch off, and then switch on, shell growth on
the (0001) facet of wurtzite CdSe cores, producing asymmetric compressive shells 
that create built-in biaxial strain, while still maintaining excellent surface
passivation (preventing defect formation, which otherwise would cause
non-radiative recombination losses). Our synthesis spreads the excitonic fine
structure uniformly and sufficiently broadly that it prevents valence-band-edge
states from being thermally depopulated. We thereby reduce the optical gain
threshold and demonstrate continuous-wave lasing from CQD solids, expanding the
library of solution-processed materials that may be capable of continuous-wave
lasing. The individual CQDs exhibit an ultra-narrow single-dot linewidth, and we 
successfully propagate this into the ensemble of CQDs.

Ancient evolutionary origin of vertebrate enteric neurons from trunk-derived
neural crest.

Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA.

The enteric nervous system of jawed vertebrates arises primarily from vagal
neural crest cells that migrate to the foregut and subsequently colonize and
innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Here we examine development of the
enteric nervous system in the basal jawless vertebrate the sea lamprey
(Petromyzon marinus) to gain insight into its evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, 
we find no evidence for the existence of a vagally derived enteric neural crest
population in the lamprey. Rather, labelling with the lipophilic dye DiI shows
that late-migrating cells, originating from the trunk neural tube and associated 
with nerve fibres, differentiate into neurons within the gut wall and typhlosole.
We propose that these trunk-derived neural crest cells may be homologous to
Schwann cell precursors, recently shown in mammalian embryos to populate
post-embryonic parasympathetic ganglia, including enteric ganglia. Our results
suggest that neural-crest-derived Schwann cell precursors made an important
contribution to the ancient enteric nervous system of early jawless vertebrates, 
a role that was largely subsumed by vagal neural crest cells in early
gnathostomes.

The folding of genomic DNA from the beads-on-a-string-like structure of
nucleosomes into higher-order assemblies is crucially linked to nuclear
processes. Here we calculate 3D structures of entire mammalian genomes using data
from a new chromosome conformation capture procedure that allows us to first
image and then process single cells. The technique enables genome folding to be
examined at a scale of less than 100 kb, and chromosome structures to be
validated. The structures of individual topological-associated domains and loops 
vary substantially from cell to cell. By contrast, A and B compartments,
lamina-associated domains and active enhancers and promoters are organized in a
consistent way on a genome-wide basis in every cell, suggesting that they could
drive chromosome and genome folding. By studying genes regulated by pluripotency 
factor and nucleosome remodelling deacetylase (NuRD), we illustrate how the
determination of single-cell genome structure provides a new approach for
investigating biological processes.

Growth in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP)-the amount of carbon dioxide
that is 'fixed' into organic material through the photosynthesis of land
plants-may provide a negative feedback for climate change. It remains uncertain, 
however, to what extent biogeochemical processes can suppress global GPP growth. 
As a consequence, modelling estimates of terrestrial carbon storage, and of
feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate, remain poorly constrained. Here
we present a global, measurement-based estimate of GPP growth during the
twentieth century that is based on long-term atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS)
records, derived from ice-core, firn and ambient air samples. We interpret these 
records using a model that simulates changes in COS concentration according to
changes in its sources and sinks-including a large sink that is related to GPP.
We find that the observation-based COS record is most consistent with simulations
of climate and the carbon cycle that assume large GPP growth during the twentieth
century (31% ± 5% growth; mean ± 95% confidence interval). Although this COS
analysis does not directly constrain models of future GPP growth, it does provide
a global-scale benchmark for historical carbon-cycle simulations.

Finding massive galaxies that stopped forming stars in the early Universe
presents an observational challenge because their rest-frame ultraviolet emission
is negligible and they can only be reliably identified by extremely deep
near-infrared surveys. These surveys have revealed the presence of massive,
quiescent early-type galaxies appearing as early as redshift z ≈ 2, an epoch
three billion years after the Big Bang. Their age and formation processes have
now been explained by an improved generation of galaxy-formation models, in which
they form rapidly at z ≈ 3-4, consistent with the typical masses and ages derived
from their observations. Deeper surveys have reported evidence for populations of
massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier times, using
coarsely sampled photometry. However, these early, massive, quiescent galaxies
are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models. Here we report 
the spectroscopic confirmation of one such galaxy at redshift z = 3.717, with a
stellar mass of 1.7 × 1011 solar masses. We derive its age to be nearly half the 
age of the Universe at this redshift and the absorption line spectrum shows no
current star formation. These observations demonstrate that the galaxy must have 
formed the majority of its stars quickly, within the first billion years of
cosmic history in a short, extreme starburst. This ancestral starburst appears
similar to those being found by submillimetre-wavelength surveys. The early
formation of such massive systems implies that our picture of early galaxy
assembly requires substantial revision.

Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics explain the dominance
of matter over antimatter in our Universe by neutrinos being their own
antiparticles. This would imply the existence of neutrinoless double-β decay,
which is an extremely rare lepton-number-violating radioactive decay process
whose detection requires the utmost background suppression. Among the programmes 
that aim to detect this decay, the GERDA Collaboration is searching for
neutrinoless double-β decay of 76Ge by operating bare detectors, made of
germanium with an enriched 76Ge fraction, in liquid argon. After having completed
Phase I of data taking, we have recently launched Phase II. Here we report that
in GERDA Phase II we have achieved a background level of approximately 10-3
counts keV-1 kg-1 yr-1. This implies that the experiment is background-free, even
when increasing the exposure up to design level. This is achieved by use of an
active veto system, superior germanium detector energy resolution and improved
background recognition of our new detectors. No signal of neutrinoless double-β
decay was found when Phase I and Phase II data were combined, and we deduce a
lower-limit half-life of 5.3 × 1025 years at the 90 per cent confidence level.
Our half-life sensitivity of 4.0 × 1025 years is competitive with the best
experiments that use a substantially larger isotope mass. The potential of an
essentially background-free search for neutrinoless double-β decay will
facilitate a larger germanium experiment with sensitivity levels that will bring 
us closer to clarifying whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles.

The crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS, the Acanthaster planci species group) is a
highly fecund predator of reef-building corals throughout the Indo-Pacific
region. COTS population outbreaks cause substantial loss of coral cover,
diminishing the integrity and resilience of reef ecosystems. Here we sequenced
genomes of COTS from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia and Okinawa, Japan to
identify gene products that underlie species-specific communication and could
potentially be used in biocontrol strategies. We focused on water-borne chemical 
plumes released from aggregating COTS, which make the normally sedentary starfish
become highly active. Peptide sequences detected in these plumes by mass
spectrometry are encoded in the COTS genome and expressed in external tissues.
The exoproteome released by aggregating COTS consists largely of signalling
factors and hydrolytic enzymes, and includes an expanded and rapidly evolving set
of starfish-specific ependymin-related proteins. These secreted proteins may be
detected by members of a large family of olfactory-receptor-like
G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed externally, sometimes in a
sex-specific manner. This study provides insights into COTS-specific
communication that may guide the generation of peptide mimetics for use on reefs 
with COTS outbreaks.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being used globally to conserve
marine resources. However, whether many MPAs are being effectively and equitably 
managed, and how MPA management influences substantive outcomes remain unknown.
We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and
218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs 
on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and
ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for
effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff
and financial resources. Although 71% of MPAs positively influenced fish
populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget
capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate
staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate
capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in
human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation
outcomes.

Cancer somatic mutations can generate neoantigens that distinguish malignant from
normal cells. However, the personalized identification and validation of
neoantigens remains a major challenge. Here we discover neoantigens in human
mantle-cell lymphomas by using an integrated genomic and proteomic strategy that 
interrogates tumour antigen peptides presented by major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. We applied this approach to
systematically characterize MHC ligands from 17 patients. Remarkably, all
discovered neoantigenic peptides were exclusively derived from the lymphoma
immunoglobulin heavy- or light-chain variable regions. Although we identified MHC
presentation of private polymorphic germline alleles, no mutated peptides were
recovered from non-immunoglobulin somatically mutated genes. Somatic mutations
within the immunoglobulin variable region were almost exclusively presented by
MHC class II. We isolated circulating CD4+ T cells specific for
immunoglobulin-derived neoantigens and found these cells could mediate killing of
autologous lymphoma cells. These results demonstrate that an integrative approach
combining MHC isolation, peptide identification, and exome sequencing is an
effective platform to uncover tumour neoantigens. Application of this strategy to
human lymphoma implicates immunoglobulin neoantigens as targets for lymphoma
immunotherapy.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is driven by the activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion 
oncoprotein. ABL1 kinase inhibitors have improved the clinical outcomes for
patients with CML, with over 80% of patients treated with imatinib surviving for 
more than 10 years. Second-generation ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce more potent
molecular responses in both previously untreated and imatinib-resistant patients 
with CML. Studies in patients with chronic-phase CML have shown that around 50%
of patients who achieve and maintain undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels for 
at least 2 years remain disease-free after the withdrawal of treatment. Here we
characterize ABL001 (asciminib), a potent and selective allosteric ABL1 inhibitor
that is undergoing clinical development testing in patients with CML and
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast
to catalytic-site ABL1 kinase inhibitors, ABL001 binds to the myristoyl pocket of
ABL1 and induces the formation of an inactive kinase conformation. ABL001 and
second-generation catalytic inhibitors have similar cellular potencies but
distinct patterns of resistance mutations, with genetic barcoding studies
revealing pre-existing clonal populations with no shared resistance between
ABL001 and the catalytic inhibitor nilotinib. Consistent with this profile,
acquired resistance was observed with single-agent therapy in mice; however, the 
combination of ABL001 and nilotinib led to complete disease control and
eradicated CML xenograft tumours without recurrence after the cessation of
treatment.

Somatic cells acquire mutations throughout the course of an individual's life.
Mutations occurring early in embryogenesis are often present in a substantial
proportion of, but not all, cells in postnatal humans and thus have particular
characteristics and effects. Depending on their location in the genome and the
proportion of cells they are present in, these mosaic mutations can cause a wide 
range of genetic disease syndromes and predispose carriers to cancer. They have a
high chance of being transmitted to offspring as de novo germline mutations and, 
in principle, can provide insights into early human embryonic cell lineages and
their contributions to adult tissues. Although it is known that gross chromosomal
abnormalities are remarkably common in early human embryos, our understanding of 
early embryonic somatic mutations is very limited. Here we use whole-genome
sequences of normal blood from 241 adults to identify 163 early embryonic
mutations. We estimate that approximately three base substitution mutations occur
per cell per cell-doubling event in early human embryogenesis and these are
mainly attributable to two known mutational signatures. We used the mutations to 
reconstruct developmental lineages of adult cells and demonstrate that the two
daughter cells of many early embryonic cell-doubling events contribute
asymmetrically to adult blood at an approximately 2:1 ratio. This study therefore
provides insights into the mutation rates, mutational processes and developmental
outcomes of cell dynamics that operate during early human embryogenesis.

Post-mitotic, differentiated cells exhibit a variety of characteristics that
contrast with those of actively growing neoplastic cells, such as the expression 
of cell-cycle inhibitors and differentiation factors. We hypothesized that the
gene expression profiles of these differentiated cells could reveal the
identities of genes that may function as tumour suppressors. Here we show, using 
in vitro and in vivo studies in mice and humans, that the mitochondrial protein
LACTB potently inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Its mechanism
of action involves alteration of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and
differentiation of breast cancer cells. This is achieved, at least in part,
through reduction of the levels of mitochondrial phosphatidylserine
decarboxylase, which is involved in the synthesis of mitochondrial
phosphatidylethanolamine. These observations uncover a novel mitochondrial tumour
suppressor and demonstrate a connection between mitochondrial lipid metabolism
and the differentiation program of breast cancer cells, thereby revealing a
previously undescribed mechanism of tumour suppression.

The brain's ability to associate different stimuli is vital for long-term memory,
but how neural ensembles encode associative memories is unknown. Here we studied 
how cell ensembles in the basal and lateral amygdala encode associations between 
conditioned and unconditioned stimuli (CS and US, respectively). Using a
miniature fluorescence microscope, we tracked the Ca2+ dynamics of ensembles of
amygdalar neurons during fear learning and extinction over 6 days in behaving
mice. Fear conditioning induced both up- and down-regulation of individual cells'
CS-evoked responses. This bi-directional plasticity mainly occurred after
conditioning, and reshaped the neural ensemble representation of the CS to become
more similar to the US representation. During extinction training with repetitive
CS presentations, the CS representation became more distinctive without reverting
to its original form. Throughout the experiments, the strength of the
ensemble-encoded CS-US association predicted the level of behavioural
conditioning in each mouse. These findings support a supervised learning model in
which activation of the US representation guides the transformation of the CS
representation.

Molecular crystals cannot be designed in the same manner as macroscopic objects, 
because they do not assemble according to simple, intuitive rules. Their
structures result from the balance of many weak interactions, rather than from
the strong and predictable bonding patterns found in metal-organic frameworks and
covalent organic frameworks. Hence, design strategies that assume a topology or
other structural blueprint will often fail. Here we combine computational crystal
structure prediction and property prediction to build energy-structure-function
maps that describe the possible structures and properties that are available to a
candidate molecule. Using these maps, we identify a highly porous solid, which
has the lowest density reported for a molecular crystal so far. Both the
structure of the crystal and its physical properties, such as methane storage
capacity and guest-molecule selectivity, are predicted using the molecular
structure as the only input. More generally, energy-structure-function maps could
be used to guide the experimental discovery of materials with any target function
that can be calculated from predicted crystal structures, such as electronic
structure or mechanical properties.

A significant fraction of patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with
androgen deprivation therapy experience relapse with relentless progression to
lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Immune checkpoint
blockade using antibodies against cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
(CTLA4) or programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PD-L1)
generates durable therapeutic responses in a significant subset of patients
across a variety of cancer types. However, mCRPC showed overwhelming de novo
resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, motivating a search for targeted
therapies that overcome this resistance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)
are known to play important roles in tumour immune evasion. The abundance of
circulating MDSCs correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels and metastasis
in patients with prostate cancer. Mouse models of prostate cancer show that MDSCs
(CD11b+Gr1+) promote tumour initiation and progression. These observations
prompted us to hypothesize that robust immunotherapy responses in mCRPC may be
elicited by the combined actions of immune checkpoint blockade agents together
with targeted agents that neutralize MDSCs yet preserve T-cell function. Here we 
develop a novel chimaeric mouse model of mCRPC to efficiently test combination
therapies in an autochthonous setting. Combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1
engendered only modest efficacy. Targeted therapy against mCRPC-infiltrating
MDSCs, using multikinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib and BEZ235, also showed 
minimal anti-tumour activities. Strikingly, primary and metastatic CRPC showed
robust synergistic responses when immune checkpoint blockade was combined with
MDSC-targeted therapy. Mechanistically, combination therapy efficacy stemmed from
the upregulation of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and suppression of
MDSC-promoting cytokines secreted by prostate cancer cells. These observations
illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining immune checkpoint blockade
with MDSC-targeted therapies in the treatment of mCRPC.

Establishing the relationship between rates of change in species richness and
biotic and abiotic environmental change is a major goal of evolutionary biology. 
Although exquisite fossil and geological records provide insight in rare cases,
most groups lack high-quality fossil records. Consequently, biologists typically 
rely on molecular phylogenies to study the diversity dynamics of clades, usually 
by correlating changes in diversification rate with environmental or trait
shifts. However, inferences drawn from molecular phylogenies can be limited owing
to the challenge of accounting for extinct species, making it difficult to
accurately determine the underlying diversity dynamics that produce them. Here,
using a geologically informed model of the relationship between changing island
area and species richness for the Hawaiian archipelago, we infer the rates of
species richness change for 14 endemic groups over their entire evolutionary
histories without the need for fossil data, or molecular phylogenies. We find
that these endemic clades underwent evolutionary radiations characterized by
initially increasing rates of species accumulation, followed by slow-downs. In
fact, for most groups on most islands, their time of evolutionary expansion has
long past, and they are now undergoing previously unrecognized long-term
evolutionary decline. Our results show how landscape dynamism can drive
evolutionary dynamics over broad timescales, including driving species loss that 
is not readily detected using molecular phylogenies, or without a rich fossil
record. We anticipate that examination of other clades where the relationship
between environmental change and species richness change can be quantified will
reveal that many other living groups have also experienced similarly complex
evolutionary trajectories, including long-term and ongoing evolutionary decline.

A zeolite with structure type MFI is an aluminosilicate or silicate material that
has a three-dimensionally connected pore network, which enables molecular
recognition in the size range 0.5-0.6 nm. These micropore dimensions are relevant
for many valuable chemical intermediates, and therefore MFI-type zeolites are
widely used in the chemical industry as selective catalysts or adsorbents. As
with all zeolites, strategies to tailor them for specific applications include
controlling their crystal size and shape. Nanometre-thick MFI crystals
(nanosheets) have been introduced in pillared and self-pillared (intergrown)
architectures, offering improved mass-transfer characteristics for certain
adsorption and catalysis applications. Moreover, single (non-intergrown and
non-layered) nanosheets have been used to prepare thin membranes that could be
used to improve the energy efficiency of separation processes. However, until
now, single MFI nanosheets have been prepared using a multi-step approach based
on the exfoliation of layered MFI, followed by centrifugation to remove
non-exfoliated particles. This top-down method is time-consuming, costly and
low-yield and it produces fragmented nanosheets with submicrometre lateral
dimensions. Alternatively, direct (bottom-up) synthesis could produce
high-aspect-ratio zeolite nanosheets, with improved yield and at lower cost. Here
we use a nanocrystal-seeded growth method triggered by a single rotational
intergrowth to synthesize high-aspect-ratio MFI nanosheets with a thickness of 5 
nanometres (2.5 unit cells). These high-aspect-ratio nanosheets allow the
fabrication of thin and defect-free coatings that effectively cover porous
substrates. These coatings can be intergrown to produce high-flux and
ultra-selective MFI membranes that compare favourably with other MFI membranes
prepared from existing MFI materials (such as exfoliated nanosheets or
nanocrystals).

ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the exporter class harness the energy 
of ATP hydrolysis in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to power the
energetically uphill efflux of substrates by a dedicated transmembrane domain
(TMD). Although numerous investigations have described the mechanism of ATP
hydrolysis and defined the architecture of ABC exporters, a detailed structural
dynamic understanding of the transduction of ATP energy to the work of substrate 
translocation remains elusive. Here we used double electron-electron resonance
and molecular dynamics simulations to describe the ATP- and substrate-coupled
conformational cycle of the mouse ABC efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp;
also known as ABCB1), which has a central role in the clearance of xenobiotics
and in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Pairs of spin labels were introduced at
residues selected to track the putative inward-facing to outward-facing
transition. Our findings illuminate how ATP energy is harnessed in the NBDs in a 
two-stroke cycle and elucidate the consequent conformational motion that
reconfigures the TMD, two critical aspects of Pgp transport mechanism. Along with
a fully atomistic model of the outward-facing conformation in membranes, the
insight into Pgp conformational dynamics harmonizes mechanistic and structural
data into a novel perspective on ATP-coupled transport and reveals mechanistic
divergence within the efflux class of ABC transporters.

Millions of people die every year from diseases caused by exposure to outdoor air
pollution. Some studies have estimated premature mortality related to local
sources of air pollution, but local air quality can also be affected by
atmospheric transport of pollution from distant sources. International trade is
contributing to the globalization of emission and pollution as a result of the
production of goods (and their associated emissions) in one region for
consumption in another region. The effects of international trade on air
pollutant emissions, air quality and health have been investigated regionally,
but a combined, global assessment of the health impacts related to international 
trade and the transport of atmospheric air pollution is lacking. Here we combine 
four global models to estimate premature mortality caused by fine particulate
matter (PM2.5) pollution as a result of atmospheric transport and the production 
and consumption of goods and services in different world regions. We find that,
of the 3.45 million premature deaths related to PM2.5 pollution in 2007
worldwide, about 12 per cent (411,100 deaths) were related to air pollutants
emitted in a region of the world other than that in which the death occurred, and
about 22 per cent (762,400 deaths) were associated with goods and services
produced in one region for consumption in another. For example, PM2.5 pollution
produced in China in 2007 is linked to more than 64,800 premature deaths in
regions other than China, including more than 3,100 premature deaths in western
Europe and the USA; on the other hand, consumption in western Europe and the USA 
is linked to more than 108,600 premature deaths in China. Our results reveal that
the transboundary health impacts of PM2.5 pollution associated with international
trade are greater than those associated with long-distance atmospheric pollutant 
transport.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to represent the driving force
behind tumour progression and metastasis, making them attractive cancer targets. 
However, conclusive experimental evidence for their functional relevance is still
lacking for most malignancies. Here we show that the leucine-rich
repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) identifies intestinal CSCs 
in mouse tumours engineered to recapitulate the clinical progression of human
colorectal cancer. We demonstrate that selective Lgr5+ cell ablation restricts
primary tumour growth, but does not result in tumour regression. Instead, tumours
are maintained by proliferative Lgr5- cells that continuously attempt to
replenish the Lgr5+ CSC pool, leading to rapid re-initiation of tumour growth
upon treatment cessation. Notably, CSCs are critical for the formation and
maintenance of liver metastasis derived from colorectal cancers. Together, our
data highlight distinct CSC dependencies for primary versus metastasic tumour
growth, and suggest that targeting CSCs may represent a therapeutic opportunity
for managing metastatic disease.

Molecular recognition, binding and catalysis are often mediated by non-covalent
interactions involving aromatic functional groups. Although the relative
complexity of these so-called π interactions has made them challenging to study, 
theory and modelling have now reached the stage at which we can explain their
physical origins and obtain reliable insight into their effects on molecular
binding and chemical transformations. This offers opportunities for the rational 
manipulation of these complex non-covalent interactions and their direct
incorporation into the design of small-molecule catalysts and enzymes.

Recent theoretical work in celestial mechanics has revealed that an asteroid may 
orbit stably in the same region as a planet, despite revolving around the Sun in 
the sense opposite to that of the planet itself. Asteroid 2015 BZ509 was
discovered in 2015, but with too much uncertainty in its measured orbit to
establish whether it was such a retrograde co-orbital body. Here we report
observations and analysis that demonstrates that asteroid 2015 BZ509 is indeed a 
retrograde co-orbital asteroid of the planet Jupiter. We find that 2015 BZ509 has
long-term stability, having been in its current, resonant state for around a
million years. This is long enough to preclude precise calculation of the time or
mechanism of its injection to its present state, but it may be a Halley-family
comet that entered the resonance through an interaction with Saturn. Retrograde
co-orbital asteroids of Jupiter and other planets may be more common than
previously expected.

During spatial navigation, neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial
entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location,
head direction, speed, and proximity to boundaries. These activity patterns are
thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However, the
hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but
also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this
general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A
conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is
just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous,
task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal
and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to
manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural
representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed
discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this 
representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such 
as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit
mechanisms in the hippocampal-entorhinal system are used to represent diverse
behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial
navigation.

Recent hydrological modelling and Earth observations have located and quantified 
alarming rates of groundwater depletion worldwide. This depletion is primarily
due to water withdrawals for irrigation, but its connection with the main driver 
of irrigation, global food consumption, has not yet been explored. Here we show
that approximately eleven per cent of non-renewable groundwater use for
irrigation is embedded in international food trade, of which two-thirds are
exported by Pakistan, the USA and India alone. Our quantification of groundwater 
depletion embedded in the world's food trade is based on a combination of global,
crop-specific estimates of non-renewable groundwater abstraction and
international food trade data. A vast majority of the world's population lives in
countries sourcing nearly all their staple crop imports from partners who deplete
groundwater to produce these crops, highlighting risks for global food and water 
security. Some countries, such as the USA, Mexico, Iran and China, are
particularly exposed to these risks because they both produce and import food
irrigated from rapidly depleting aquifers. Our results could help to improve the 
sustainability of global food production and groundwater resource management by
identifying priority regions and agricultural products at risk as well as the end
consumers of these products.

Coherence phenomena arise from interference, or the addition, of wave-like
amplitudes with fixed phase differences. Although coherence has been shown to
yield transformative ways for improving function, advances have been confined to 
pristine matter and coherence was considered fragile. However, recent evidence of
coherence in chemical and biological systems suggests that the phenomena are
robust and can survive in the face of disorder and noise. Here we survey the
state of recent discoveries, present viewpoints that suggest that coherence can
be used in complex chemical systems, and discuss the role of coherence as a
design element in realizing function.

Transition-metal complexes are used as photosensitizers, in light-emitting
diodes, for biosensing and in photocatalysis. A key feature in these applications
is excitation from the ground state to a charge-transfer state; the long
charge-transfer-state lifetimes typical for complexes of ruthenium and other
precious metals are often essential to ensure high performance. There is much
interest in replacing these scarce elements with Earth-abundant metals, with iron
and copper being particularly attractive owing to their low cost and
non-toxicity. But despite the exploration of innovative molecular designs, it
remains a formidable scientific challenge to access Earth-abundant
transition-metal complexes with long-lived charge-transfer excited states. No
known iron complexes are considered photoluminescent at room temperature, and
their rapid excited-state deactivation precludes their use as photosensitizers.
Here we present the iron complex [Fe(btz)3]3+ (where btz is
3,3'-dimethyl-1,1'-bis(p-tolyl)-4,4'-bis(1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene)), and show that
the superior σ-donor and π-acceptor electron properties of the ligand stabilize
the excited state sufficiently to realize a long charge-transfer lifetime of 100 
picoseconds (ps) and room-temperature photoluminescence. This species is a
low-spin Fe(iii) d5 complex, and emission occurs from a long-lived doublet
ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (2LMCT) state that is rarely seen for
transition-metal complexes. The absence of intersystem crossing, which often
gives rise to large excited-state energy losses in transition-metal complexes,
enables the observation of spin-allowed emission directly to the ground state and
could be exploited as an increased driving force in photochemical reactions on
surfaces. These findings suggest that appropriate design strategies can deliver
new iron-based materials for use as light emitters and photosensitizers.

The vertebrate-conserved RNA-binding protein DND1 is required for the survival of
primordial germ cells (PGCs), as well as the suppression of germ cell tumours in 
mice. Here we show that in mice DND1 binds a UU(A/U) trinucleotide motif
predominantly in the 3' untranslated regions of mRNA, and destabilizes target
mRNAs through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.
Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the extent of suppression is dependent on
the number of DND1-binding sites. This DND1-dependent mRNA destabilization is
required for the survival of mouse PGCs and spermatogonial stem cells by
suppressing apoptosis. The spectrum of target RNAs includes positive regulators
of apoptosis and inflammation, and modulators of signalling pathways that
regulate stem-cell pluripotency, including the TGFβ superfamily, all of which are
aberrantly elevated in DND1-deficient PGCs. We propose that the induction of the 
post-transcriptional suppressor DND1 synergizes with concurrent transcriptional
changes to ensure precise developmental transitions during cellular
differentiation and maintenance of the germ line.

Cell proliferation and survival require the faithful maintenance and propagation 
of genetic information, which are threatened by the ubiquitous sources of DNA
damage present intracellularly and in the external environment. A system of DNA
repair, called the DNA damage response, detects and repairs damaged DNA and
prevents cell division until the repair is complete. Here we report that
methylation at the 6 position of adenosine (m6A) in RNA is rapidly (within 2 min)
and transiently induced at DNA damage sites in response to ultraviolet
irradiation. This modification occurs on numerous poly(A)+ transcripts and is
regulated by the methyltransferase METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) and the
demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein). In the absence of
METTL3 catalytic activity, cells showed delayed repair of ultraviolet-induced
cyclobutane pyrimidine adducts and elevated sensitivity to ultraviolet,
demonstrating the importance of m6A in the ultraviolet-responsive DNA damage
response. Multiple DNA polymerases are involved in the ultraviolet response, some
of which resynthesize DNA after the lesion has been excised by the nucleotide
excision repair pathway, while others participate in trans-lesion synthesis to
allow replication past damaged lesions in S phase. DNA polymerase κ (Pol κ),
which has been implicated in both nucleotide excision repair and trans-lesion
synthesis, required the catalytic activity of METTL3 for immediate localization
to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage sites. Importantly, Pol κ overexpression
qualitatively suppressed the cyclobutane pyrimidine removal defect associated
with METTL3 loss. Thus, we have uncovered a novel function for RNA m6A
modification in the ultraviolet-induced DNA damage response, and our findings
collectively support a model in which m6A RNA serves as a beacon for the
selective, rapid recruitment of Pol κ to damage sites to facilitate repair and
cell survival.

Maternally inherited 15q11-13 chromosomal triplications cause a frequent and
highly penetrant type of autism linked to increased gene dosages of UBE3A, which 
encodes a ubiquitin ligase with transcriptional co-regulatory functions. Here,
using in vivo mouse genetics, we show that increasing UBE3A in the nucleus
downregulates the glutamatergic synapse organizer Cbln1, which is needed for
sociability in mice. Epileptic seizures also repress Cbln1 and are found to
expose sociability impairments in mice with asymptomatic increases in UBE3A. This
Ube3a-seizure synergy maps to glutamate neurons of the midbrain ventral tegmental
area (VTA), where Cbln1 deletions impair sociability and weaken glutamatergic
transmission. We provide preclinical evidence that viral-vector-based
chemogenetic activation of, or restoration of Cbln1 in, VTA glutamatergic neurons
reverses the sociability deficits induced by Ube3a and/or seizures. Our results
suggest that gene and seizure interactions in VTA glutamatergic neurons impair
sociability by downregulating Cbln1, a key node in the expanding protein
interaction network of autism genes.

Plants live in biogeochemically diverse soils with diverse microbiota. Plant
organs associate intimately with a subset of these microbes, and the structure of
the microbial community can be altered by soil nutrient content. Plant-associated
microbes can compete with the plant and with each other for nutrients, but may
also carry traits that increase the productivity of the plant. It is unknown how 
the plant immune system coordinates microbial recognition with nutritional cues
during microbiome assembly. Here we establish that a genetic network controlling 
the phosphate stress response influences the structure of the root microbiome
community, even under non-stress phosphate conditions. We define a molecular
mechanism regulating coordination between nutrition and defence in the presence
of a synthetic bacterial community. We further demonstrate that the master
transcriptional regulators of phosphate stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana
also directly repress defence, consistent with plant prioritization of
nutritional stress over defence. Our work will further efforts to define and
deploy useful microbes to enhance plant performance.

The persistence of the HIV reservoir in infected individuals is a major obstacle 
to the development of a cure for HIV. Here, using an in vitro model of
HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells, we reveal a gene expression signature of 103 
upregulated genes that are specific for latently infected cells, including genes 
for 16 transmembrane proteins. In vitro screening for surface expression in
HIV-infected quiescent CD4 T cells shows that the low-affinity receptor for the
immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, CD32a, is the most highly induced, with no
detectable expression in bystander cells. Notably, productive HIV-1 infection of 
T-cell-receptor-stimulated CD4 T cells is not associated with CD32a expression,
suggesting that a quiescence-dependent mechanism is required for its induction.
Using blood samples from HIV-1-positive participants receiving suppressive
antiretroviral therapy, we identify a subpopulation of 0.012% of CD4 T cells that
express CD32a and host up to three copies of HIV DNA per cell. This CD32a+
reservoir was highly enriched in inducible replication-competent proviruses and
can be predominant in some participants. Our discovery that CD32a+ lymphocytes
represent the elusive HIV-1 reservoir may lead to insights that will facilitate
the specific targeting and elimination of this reservoir.

Insect pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline. A
major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification. 
A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats
and populations have been developed. However, the success of these initiatives
depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key
population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages, in target
species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of
systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination
of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics and
demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family
lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the
survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in
the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value
foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250-1,000 m of the
natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on 
survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee
populations. These findings also support the idea that conservation interventions
that increase floral resources at a landscape scale and throughout the season
have positive effects on wild pollinators in agricultural landscapes.

Phytoplankton can actively diversify their migration strategy in response to
turbulent cues.

Marine phytoplankton inhabit a dynamic environment where turbulence, together
with nutrient and light availability, shapes species fitness, succession and
selection. Many species of phytoplankton are motile and undertake diel vertical
migrations to gain access to nutrient-rich deeper layers at night and well-lit
surface waters during the day. Disruption of this migratory strategy by
turbulence is considered to be an important cause of the succession between
motile and non-motile species when conditions turn turbulent. However, this
classical view neglects the possibility that motile species may actively respond 
to turbulent cues to avoid layers of strong turbulence. Here we report that
phytoplankton, including raphidophytes and dinoflagellates, can actively
diversify their migratory strategy in response to hydrodynamic cues
characteristic of overturning by Kolmogorov-scale eddies. Upon experiencing
repeated overturning with timescales and statistics representative of ocean
turbulence, an upward-swimming population rapidly (5-60 min) splits into two
subpopulations, one swimming upward and one swimming downward. Quantitative
morphological analysis of the harmful-algal-bloom-forming raphidophyte
Heterosigma akashiwo together with a model of cell mechanics revealed that this
behaviour was accompanied by a modulation of the cells' fore-aft asymmetry. The
minute magnitude of the required modulation, sufficient to invert the
preferential swimming direction of the cells, highlights the advanced level of
control that phytoplankton can exert on their migratory behaviour. Together with 
observations of enhanced cellular stress after overturning and the typically
deleterious effects of strong turbulence on motile phytoplankton, these results
point to an active adaptation of H. akashiwo to increase the chance of evading
turbulent layers by diversifying the direction of migration within the
population, in a manner suggestive of evolutionary bet-hedging. This migratory
behaviour relaxes the boundaries between the fluid dynamic niches of motile and
non-motile phytoplankton, and highlights that rapid responses to hydrodynamic
cues are important survival strategies for phytoplankton in the ocean.

The chemical composition of Earth's lower mantle can be constrained by combining 
seismological observations with mineral physics elasticity measurements. However,
the lack of laboratory data for Earth's most abundant mineral,
(Mg,Fe,Al)(Al,Fe,Si)O3 bridgmanite (also known as silicate perovskite), has
hampered any conclusive result. Here we report single-crystal elasticity data on 
(Al,Fe)-bearing bridgmanite (Mg0.9Fe0.1Si0.9Al0.1)O3 measured using high-pressure
Brillouin spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Our measurements show that the
elastic behaviour of (Al,Fe)-bearing bridgmanite is markedly different from the
behaviour of the MgSiO3 endmember. We use our data to model seismic wave
velocities in the top portion of the lower mantle, assuming a pyrolitic mantle
composition and accounting for depth-dependent changes in iron partitioning
between bridgmanite and ferropericlase. We find excellent agreement between our
mineral physics predictions and the seismic Preliminary Reference Earth Model
down to at least 1,200 kilometres depth, indicating chemical homogeneity of the
upper and shallow lower mantle. A high Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of about two in
shallow-lower-mantle bridgmanite is required to match seismic data, implying the 
presence of metallic iron in an isochemical mantle. Our calculated velocities are
in increasingly poor agreement with those of the lower mantle at depths greater
than 1,200 kilometres, indicating either a change in bridgmanite cation ordering 
or a decrease in the ferric iron content of the lower mantle.

Highly potent and broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) have been
used to prevent and treat lentivirus infections in humanized mice, macaques, and 
humans. In immunotherapy experiments, administration of bNAbs to chronically
infected animals transiently suppresses virus replication, which invariably
returns to pre-treatment levels and results in progression to clinical disease.
Here we show that early administration of bNAbs in a macaque simian/human
immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model is associated with very low levels of
persistent viraemia, which leads to the establishment of T-cell immunity and
resultant long-term infection control. Animals challenged with SHIVAD8-EO by
mucosal or intravenous routes received a single 2-week course of two potent
passively transferred bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-1074 (refs 13, 14)). Viraemia
remained undetectable for 56-177 days, depending on bNAb half-life in vivo.
Moreover, in the 13 treated monkeys, plasma virus loads subsequently declined to 
undetectable levels in 6 controller macaques. Four additional animals maintained 
their counts of T cells carrying the CD4 antigen (CD4+) and very low levels of
viraemia persisted for over 2 years. The frequency of cells carrying
replication-competent virus was less than 1 per 106 circulating CD4+ T cells in
the six controller macaques. Infusion of a T-cell-depleting anti-CD8β monoclonal 
antibody to the controller animals led to a specific decline in levels of CD8+ T 
cells and the rapid reappearance of plasma viraemia. In contrast, macaques
treated for 15 weeks with combination anti-retroviral therapy, beginning on day 3
after infection, experienced sustained rebound plasma viraemia when treatment was
interrupted. Our results show that passive immunotherapy during acute SHIV
infection differs from combination anti-retroviral therapy in that it facilitates
the emergence of potent CD8+ T-cell immunity able to durably suppress virus
replication.

Remote site-selective C-H activation directed by a catalytic bifunctional
template.

Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.

In chemical syntheses, the activation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds converts
them directly into carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds without requiring any
prior functionalization. C-H activation can thus substantially reduce the number 
of steps involved in a synthesis. A single specific C-H bond in a substrate can
be activated by using a 'directing' (usually a functional) group to obtain the
desired product selectively. The applicability of such a C-H activation reaction 
can be severely curtailed by the distance of the C-H bond in question from the
directing group, and by the shape of the substrate, but several approaches have
been developed to overcome these limitations. In one such approach, an
understanding of the distal and geometric relationships between the functional
groups and C-H bonds of a substrate has been exploited to achieve meta-selective 
C-H activation by using a covalently attached, U-shaped template. However,
stoichiometric installation of this template has not been feasible in the absence
of an appropriate functional group on which to attach it. Here we report the
design of a catalytic, bifunctional nitrile template that binds a heterocyclic
substrate via a reversible coordination instead of a covalent linkage. The two
metal centres coordinated to this template have different roles: one reversibly
anchors substrates near the catalyst, and the other cleaves remote C-H bonds.
Using this strategy, we demonstrate remote, site-selective C-H olefination of
heterocyclic substrates that do not have the necessary functional groups for
covalently attaching templates.

The organization of the genome in the nucleus and the interactions of genes with 
their regulatory elements are key features of transcriptional control and their
disruption can cause disease. Here we report a genome-wide method, genome
architecture mapping (GAM), for measuring chromatin contacts and other features
of three-dimensional chromatin topology on the basis of sequencing DNA from a
large collection of thin nuclear sections. We apply GAM to mouse embryonic stem
cells and identify enrichment for specific interactions between active genes and 
enhancers across very large genomic distances using a mathematical model termed
SLICE (statistical inference of co-segregation). GAM also reveals an abundance of
three-way contacts across the genome, especially between regions that are highly 
transcribed or contain super-enhancers, providing a level of insight into genome 
architecture that, owing to the technical limitations of current technologies,
has previously remained unattainable. Furthermore, GAM highlights a role for
gene-expression-specific contacts in organizing the genome in mammalian nuclei.

networks.

The human genome encodes some 350 Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing
zinc-finger proteins (KZFPs), the products of a rapidly evolving gene family that
has been traced back to early tetrapods. The function of most KZFPs is unknown,
but a few have been demonstrated to repress transposable elements in embryonic
stem (ES) cells by recruiting the transcriptional regulator TRIM28 and associated
mediators of histone H3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)-dependent heterochromatin
formation and DNA methylation. Depletion of TRIM28 in human or mouse ES cells
triggers the upregulation of a broad range of transposable elements, and recent
data based on a few specific examples have pointed to an arms race between hosts 
and transposable elements as an important driver of KZFP gene selection. Here, to
obtain a global view of this phenomenon, we combined phylogenetic and genomic
studies to investigate the evolutionary emergence of KZFP genes in vertebrates
and to identify their targets in the human genome. First, we unexpectedly
reassigned the root of the family to a common ancestor of coelacanths and
tetrapods. Second, although we confirmed that the majority of KZFPs bind
transposable elements and pinpoint cases of ongoing co-evolution, we found that
most of their transposable element targets have lost all transposition potential.
Third, by examining the interplay between human KZFPs and other transcriptional
modulators, we obtained evidence that KZFPs exploit evolutionarily conserved
fragments of transposable elements as regulatory platforms long after the arms
race against these genetic invaders has ended. Together, our results demonstrate 
that KZFPs partner with transposable elements to build a largely
species-restricted layer of epigenetic regulation.

A wide variety of high-performance applications require materials for which shape
control is maintained under substantial stress, and that have minimal density.
Bio-inspired hexagonal and square honeycomb structures and lattice materials
based on repeating unit cells composed of webs or trusses, when made from
materials of high elastic stiffness and low density, represent some of the
lightest, stiffest and strongest materials available today. Recent advances in 3D
printing and automated assembly have enabled such complicated material geometries
to be fabricated at low (and declining) cost. These mechanical metamaterials have
properties that are a function of their mesoscale geometry as well as their
constituents, leading to combinations of properties that are unobtainable in
solid materials; however, a material geometry that achieves the theoretical upper
bounds for isotropic elasticity and strain energy storage (the Hashin-Shtrikman
upper bounds) has yet to be identified. Here we evaluate the manner in which
strain energy distributes under load in a representative selection of material
geometries, to identify the morphological features associated with high elastic
performance. Using finite-element models, supported by analytical methods, and a 
heuristic optimization scheme, we identify a material geometry that achieves the 
Hashin-Shtrikman upper bounds on isotropic elastic stiffness. Previous work has
focused on truss networks and anisotropic honeycombs, neither of which can
achieve this theoretical limit. We find that stiff but well distributed networks 
of plates are required to transfer loads efficiently between neighbouring
members. The resulting low-density mechanical metamaterials have many
advantageous properties: their mesoscale geometry can facilitate large crushing
strains with high energy absorption, optical bandgaps and mechanically tunable
acoustic bandgaps, high thermal insulation, buoyancy, and fluid storage and
transport. Our relatively simple design can be manufactured using origami-like
sheet folding and bonding methods.

Imaging of vibrational excitations in and near nanostructures is essential for
developing low-loss infrared nanophotonics, controlling heat transport in thermal
nanodevices, inventing new thermoelectric materials and understanding nanoscale
energy transport. Spatially resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy has
previously been used to image plasmonic behaviour in nanostructures in an
electron microscope, but hitherto it has not been possible to map vibrational
modes directly in a single nanostructure, limiting our understanding of phonon
coupling with photons and plasmons. Here we present spatial mapping of optical
and acoustic, bulk and surface vibrational modes in magnesium oxide nanocubes
using an atom-wide electron beam. We find that the energy and the symmetry of the
surface polariton phonon modes depend on the size of the nanocubes, and that they
are localized to the surfaces of the nanocube. We also observe a limiting of bulk
phonon scattering in the presence of surface phonon modes. Most phonon
spectroscopies are selectively sensitive to either surface or bulk excitations;
therefore, by demonstrating the excitation of both bulk and surface vibrational
modes using a single probe, our work represents advances in the detection and
visualization of spatially confined surface and bulk phonons in nanostructures.

Measurement of spin precession is central to extreme sensing in physics,
geophysics, chemistry, nanotechnology and neuroscience, and underlies magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. Because there is no spin-angle operator, any measurement 
of spin precession is necessarily indirect, for example, it may be inferred from 
spin projectors at different times. Such projectors do not commute, and so
quantum measurement back-action-the random change in a quantum state due to
measurement-necessarily enters the spin measurement record, introducing errors
and limiting sensitivity. Here we show that this disturbance in the spin
projector can be reduced below N1/2-the classical limit for N spins-by directing 
the quantum measurement back-action almost entirely into an unmeasured spin
component. This generates a planar squeezed state that, because spins obey
non-Heisenberg uncertainty relations, enables simultaneous precise knowledge of
spin angle and spin amplitude. We use high-dynamic-range optical quantum
non-demolition measurements applied to a precessing magnetic spin ensemble to
demonstrate spin tracking with steady-state angular sensitivity 2.9 decibels
below the standard quantum limit, simultaneously with amplitude sensitivity 7.0
decibels below the Poissonian variance. The standard quantum limit and Poissonian
variance indicate the best possible sensitivity with independent particles. Our
method surpasses these limits in non-commuting observables, enabling
orders-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity for state-of-the-art sensing and 
spectroscopy.

For 130 years, dinosaurs have been divided into two distinct clades-Ornithischia 
and Saurischia. Here we present a hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships
of the major dinosaurian groups that challenges the current consensus concerning 
early dinosaur evolution and highlights problematic aspects of current cladistic 
definitions. Our study has found a sister-group relationship between Ornithischia
and Theropoda (united in the new clade Ornithoscelida), with Sauropodomorpha and 
Herrerasauridae (as the redefined Saurischia) forming its monophyletic outgroup. 
This new tree topology requires redefinition and rediagnosis of Dinosauria and
the subsidiary dinosaurian clades. In addition, it forces re-evaluations of early
dinosaur cladogenesis and character evolution, suggests that hypercarnivory was
acquired independently in herrerasaurids and theropods, and offers an explanation
for many of the anatomical features previously regarded as notable convergences
between theropods and early ornithischians.

The cellular response to hypoxia is critical for cell survival and is fine-tuned 
to allow cells to recover from hypoxic stress and adapt to heterogeneous or
fluctuating oxygen levels. The hypoxic response is mediated by the α-subunit of
the transcription factor HIF-1 (HIF-1α), which interacts through its
intrinsically disordered C-terminal transactivation domain with the TAZ1 (also
known as CH1) domain of the general transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 to 
control the transcription of critical adaptive genes. One such gene encodes
CITED2, a negative feedback regulator that attenuates HIF-1 transcriptional
activity by competing for TAZ1 binding through its own disordered transactivation
domain. Little is known about the molecular mechanism by which CITED2 displaces
the tightly bound HIF-1α from their common cellular target. The HIF-1α and CITED2
transactivation domains bind to TAZ1 through helical motifs that flank a
conserved LP(Q/E)L sequence that is essential for negative feedback regulation.
Here we show that human CITED2 displaces HIF-1α by forming a transient ternary
complex with TAZ1 and HIF-1α and competing for a shared binding site through its 
LPEL motif, thus promoting a conformational change in TAZ1 that increases the
rate of HIF-1α dissociation. Through allosteric enhancement of HIF-1α release,
CITED2 activates a highly responsive negative feedback circuit that rapidly and
efficiently attenuates the hypoxic response, even at modest CITED2
concentrations. This hypersensitive regulatory switch is entirely dependent on
the unique flexibility and binding properties of these intrinsically disordered
proteins and probably exemplifies a common strategy used by the cell to respond
rapidly to environmental signals.

The small intestinal epithelium self-renews every four or five days. Intestinal
stem cells (Lgr5+ crypt base columnar cells (CBCs)) sustain this renewal and
reside between terminally differentiated Paneth cells at the bottom of the
intestinal crypt. Whereas the signalling requirements for maintaining stem cell
function and crypt homeostasis have been well studied, little is known about how 
metabolism contributes to epithelial homeostasis. Here we show that freshly
isolated Lgr5+ CBCs and Paneth cells from the mouse small intestine display
different metabolic programs. Compared to Paneth cells, Lgr5+ CBCs display high
mitochondrial activity. Inhibition of mitochondrial activity in Lgr5+ CBCs or
inhibition of glycolysis in Paneth cells strongly affects stem cell function, as 
indicated by impaired organoid formation. In addition, Paneth cells support stem 
cell function by providing lactate to sustain the enhanced mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation in the Lgr5+ CBCs. Mechanistically, we show that
oxidative phosphorylation stimulates p38 MAPK activation by mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species signalling, thereby establishing the mature crypt
phenotype. Together, our results reveal a critical role for the metabolic
identity of Lgr5+ CBCs and Paneth cells in supporting optimal stem cell function,
and we identify mitochondria and reactive oxygen species signalling as a driving 
force of cellular differentiation.

Although the main focus of immuno-oncology has been manipulating the adaptive
immune system, harnessing both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system 
might produce superior tumour reduction and elimination. Tumour-associated
macrophages often have net pro-tumour effects, but their embedded location and
their untapped potential provide impetus to discover strategies to turn them
against tumours. Strategies that deplete (anti-CSF-1 antibodies and CSF-1R
inhibition) or stimulate (agonistic anti-CD40 or inhibitory anti-CD47 antibodies)
tumour-associated macrophages have had some success. We hypothesized that
pharmacologic modulation of macrophage phenotype could produce an anti-tumour
effect. We previously reported that a first-in-class selective class IIa histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, TMP195, influenced human monocyte responses to the 
colony-stimulating factors CSF-1 and CSF-2 in vitro. Here, we utilize a
macrophage-dependent autochthonous mouse model of breast cancer to demonstrate
that in vivo TMP195 treatment alters the tumour microenvironment and reduces
tumour burden and pulmonary metastases by modulating macrophage phenotypes.
TMP195 induces the recruitment and differentiation of highly phagocytic and
stimulatory macrophages within tumours. Furthermore, combining TMP195 with
chemotherapy regimens or T-cell checkpoint blockade in this model significantly
enhances the durability of tumour reduction. These data introduce class IIa HDAC 
inhibition as a means to harness the anti-tumour potential of macrophages to
enhance cancer therapy.

Bone has recently emerged as a pleiotropic endocrine organ that secretes at least
two hormones, FGF23 and osteocalcin, which regulate kidney function and glucose
homeostasis, respectively. These findings have raised the question of whether
other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we
identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as
an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments 
in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by
inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin
sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2
crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in
the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an
MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results
identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which 
suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of
appetite is an endocrine function of bone.

Elasmobranch fishes, including sharks, rays, and skates, use specialized
electrosensory organs called ampullae of Lorenzini to detect extremely small
changes in environmental electric fields. Electrosensory cells within these
ampullae can discriminate and respond to minute changes in environmental voltage 
gradients through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that the voltage-gated
calcium channel CaV1.3 and the big conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK)
channel are preferentially expressed by electrosensory cells in little skate
(Leucoraja erinacea) and functionally couple to mediate electrosensory cell
membrane voltage oscillations, which are important for the detection of specific,
weak electrical signals. Both channels exhibit unique properties compared with
their mammalian orthologues that support electrosensory functions: structural
adaptations in CaV1.3 mediate a low-voltage threshold for activation, and
alterations in BK support specifically tuned voltage oscillations. These findings
reveal a molecular basis of electroreception and demonstrate how discrete
evolutionary changes in ion channel structure facilitate sensory adaptation.

Natural products preserved in the geological record can function as 'molecular
fossils', providing insight into organisms and physiologies that existed in the
deep past. One important group of molecular fossils is the steroidal hydrocarbons
(steranes), which are the diagenetic remains of sterol lipids. Complex sterols
with modified side chains are unique to eukaryotes, although simpler sterols can 
also be synthesized by a few bacteria. Sterol biosynthesis is an oxygen-intensive
process; thus, the presence of complex steranes in ancient rocks not only signals
the presence of eukaryotes, but also aerobic metabolic processes. In 1999,
steranes were reported in 2.7 billion year (Gyr)-old rocks from the Pilbara
Craton in Australia, suggesting a long delay between photosynthetic oxygen
production and its accumulation in the atmosphere (also known as the Great
Oxidation Event) 2.45-2.32 Gyr ago. However, the recent reappraisal and rejection
of these steranes as contaminants pushes the oldest reported steranes forward to 
around 1.64 Gyr ago (ref. 6). Here we use a molecular clock approach to improve
constraints on the evolution of sterol biosynthesis. We infer that stem
eukaryotes shared functionally modern sterol biosynthesis genes with bacteria via
horizontal gene transfer. Comparing multiple molecular clock analyses, we find
that the maximum marginal probability for the divergence time of bacterial and
eukaryal sterol biosynthesis genes is around 2.31 Gyr ago, concurrent with the
most recent geochemical evidence for the Great Oxidation Event. Our results
therefore indicate that simple sterol biosynthesis existed well before the
diversification of living eukaryotes, substantially predating the oldest detected
sterane biomarkers (approximately 1.64 Gyr ago), and furthermore, that the
evolutionary history of sterol biosynthesis is tied to the first widespread
availability of molecular oxygen in the ocean-atmosphere system.

Episodic tremor and accompanying slow slip, together called ETS, is most often
observed in subduction zones of young and warm subducting slabs. ETS should help 
us to understand the mechanics of subduction megathrusts, but its mechanism is
still unclear. It is commonly assumed that ETS represents a transition from
seismic to aseismic behaviour of the megathrust with increasing depth, but this
assumption is in contradiction with an observed spatial separation between the
seismogenic zone and the ETS zone. Here we propose a unifying model for the
necessary geological condition of ETS that explains the relationship between the 
two zones. By developing numerical thermal models, we examine the governing role 
of thermo-petrologically controlled fault zone rheology (frictional versus
viscous shear). High temperatures in the warm-slab environment cause the
megathrust seismogenic zone to terminate before reaching the depth of the
intersection of the continental Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho) and the
subduction interface, called the mantle wedge corner. High pore-fluid pressures
around the mantle wedge corner give rise to an isolated friction zone responsible
for ETS. Separating the two zones is a segment of semi-frictional or viscous
behaviour. The new model reconciles a wide range of seemingly disparate
observations and defines a conceptual framework for the study of slip behaviour
and the seismogenesis of major faults.

Loss of proteostasis underlies ageing and neurodegeneration characterized by the 
accumulation of protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although many
neurodegenerative-disease-associated proteins can be found in mitochondria, it
remains unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation could be
related. In dividing yeast cells, protein aggregates that form under stress or
during ageing are preferentially retained by the mother cell, in part through
tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps to dissociate
aggregates and thereby enables refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins.
Here we show that, in yeast, cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported
into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates that form under heat shock 
contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with the
mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter the
mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after heat shock, and some do so
even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires the
mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but
not proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated
proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded
proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress. We term this
mitochondria-mediated proteostasis mechanism MAGIC (mitochondria as guardian in
cytosol) and provide evidence that it may exist in human cells.

Enzymatic mineralization generates ultrastiff and tough hydrogels with tunable

The cartilage and skin of animals, which are made up of more than fifty per cent 
water, are rather stiff (having elastic moduli of up to 100 megapascals) as well 
as tough and hard to break (with fracture energies of up to 9,000 joules per
square metre). Such features make these biological materials mechanically
superior to existing synthetic hydrogels. Lately, progress has been made in
synthesizing tough hydrogels, with double-network hydrogels achieving the
toughness of skin and inorganic-organic composites showing even better
performance. However, these materials owe their toughness to high stretchability;
in terms of stiffness, synthetic hydrogels cannot compete with their natural
counterparts, with the best examples having elastic moduli of just 10 megapascals
or less. Previously, we described the enzyme-induced precipitation and
crystallization of hydrogels containing calcium carbonate, but the resulting
materials were brittle. Here we report the enzyme-induced formation of amorphous 
calcium phosphate nanostructures that are homogenously distributed within polymer
hydrogels. Our best materials have fracture energies of 1,300 joules per square
metre even in their fully water-swollen state-a value superior to that of most
known water-swollen synthetic materials. We are also able to modulate their
stiffness up to 440 megapascals, well beyond that of cartilage and skin.
Furthermore, the highly filled composite materials can be designed to be
optically transparent and to retain most of their stretchability even when
notched. We show that percolation drives the mechanical properties, particularly 
the high stiffness, of our uniformly mineralized hydrogels.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) integrates nutrient signals to 
control cell growth and organismal homeostasis across eukaryotes. The
evolutionarily conserved GATOR complex regulates mTORC1 signalling through Rag
GTPases, and GATOR1 displays GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity for RAGA
and RAGB (RAGA/B) and GATOR2 has been proposed to be an inhibitor of GATOR1.
Furthermore, the metazoan-specific SESN proteins function as guanine nucleotide
dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for RAGA/B, and interact with GATOR2 with unknown 
effects. Here we show that SZT2 (seizure threshold 2), a metazoan-specific
protein mutated in epilepsy, recruits a fraction of mammalian GATOR1 and GATOR2
to form a SZT2-orchestrated GATOR (SOG) complex with an essential role in GATOR- 
and SESN-dependent nutrient sensing and mTORC1 regulation. The interaction of
SZT2 with GATOR1 and GATOR2 was synergistic, and an intact SOG complex was
required for its localization at the lysosome. SZT2 deficiency resulted in
constitutive mTORC1 signalling in cells under nutrient-deprived conditions and
neonatal lethality in mice, which was associated with failure to inactivate
mTORC1 during fasting. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 in SZT2-deficient cells could be
partially corrected by overexpression of the GATOR1 component DEPDC5, and by the 
lysosome-targeted GATOR2 component WDR59 or lysosome-targeted SESN2. These
findings demonstrate that SZT2 has a central role in dictating GATOR-dependent
nutrient sensing by promoting lysosomal localization of SOG, and reveal an
unexpected function of lysosome-located GATOR2 in suppressing mTORC1 signalling
through SESN recruitment.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of 
cell growth that responds to diverse environmental signals and is deregulated in 
many human diseases, including cancer and epilepsy. Amino acids are a key input
to this system, and act through the Rag GTPases to promote the translocation of
mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Multiple protein
complexes regulate the Rag GTPases in response to amino acids, including GATOR1, 
a GTPase activating protein for RAGA, and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown
molecular function. Here we identify a protein complex (KICSTOR) that is composed
of four proteins, KPTN, ITFG2, C12orf66 and SZT2, and that is required for amino 
acid or glucose deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 in cultured human cells. In mice
that lack SZT2, mTORC1 signalling is increased in several tissues, including in
neurons in the brain. KICSTOR localizes to lysosomes; binds and recruits GATOR1, 
but not GATOR2, to the lysosomal surface; and is necessary for the interaction of
GATOR1 with its substrates, the Rag GTPases, and with GATOR2. Notably, several
KICSTOR components are mutated in neurological diseases associated with mutations
that lead to hyperactive mTORC1 signalling. Thus, KICSTOR is a
lysosome-associated negative regulator of mTORC1 signalling, which, like GATOR1, 
is mutated in human disease.

Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Here we report the extensive molecular characterization of 228 primary
cervical cancers, one of the largest comprehensive genomic studies of cervical
cancer to date. We observed notable APOBEC mutagenesis patterns and identified
SHKBP1, ERBB3, CASP8, HLA-A and TGFBR2 as novel significantly mutated genes in
cervical cancer. We also discovered amplifications in immune targets CD274 (also 
known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2), and the BCAR4 long non-coding
RNA, which has been associated with response to lapatinib. Integration of human
papilloma virus (HPV) was observed in all HPV18-related samples and 76% of
HPV16-related samples, and was associated with structural aberrations and
increased target-gene expression. We identified a unique set of endometrial-like 
cervical cancers, comprised predominantly of HPV-negative tumours with relatively
high frequencies of KRAS, ARID1A and PTEN mutations. Integrative clustering of
178 samples identified keratin-low squamous, keratin-high squamous and
adenocarcinoma-rich subgroups. These molecular analyses reveal new potential
therapeutic targets for cervical cancers.

In the cold dark matter cosmology, the baryonic components of galaxies-stars and 
gas-are thought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and
non-relativistic dark matter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and
its dark-matter halo. In the local (low-redshift) Universe, the mass of dark
matter within a galactic disk increases with disk radius, becoming appreciable
and then dominant in the outer, baryonic regions of the disks of star-forming
galaxies. This results in rotation velocities of the visible matter within the
disk that are constant or increasing with disk radius-a hallmark of the
dark-matter model. Comparisons between the dynamical mass, inferred from these
velocities in rotational equilibrium, and the sum of the stellar and cold-gas
mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation ten billion years ago, inferred from
ancillary data, suggest high baryon fractions in the inner, star-forming regions 
of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than in the
local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (owing to the chosen stellar
initial-mass function and the calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons 
inconclusive in terms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves 
(showing rotation velocity as a function of disk radius) for the outer disks of
six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation velocities are not 
constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this trend arises because of 
a combination of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the massive
high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon-dominated, with dark matter
playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the large velocity
dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial pressure term that
leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing radius. The effect of
both factors appears to increase with redshift. Qualitatively, the observations
suggest that baryons in the early (high-redshift) Universe efficiently condensed 
at the centres of dark-matter haloes when gas fractions were high and dark matter
was less concentrated.

During 2015-2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral
bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented
in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major
bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater
surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface
temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the
Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern 
of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal 
effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection
of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past
exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching
in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is
essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

Plants cope with the environment in a variety of ways, and ecological analyses
attempt to capture this through life-history strategies or trait-based
categorization. These approaches are limited because they treat the trade-off
mechanisms that underlie plant responses as a black box. Approaches that involve 
the molecular or physiological analysis of plant responses to the environment
have elucidated intricate connections between developmental and environmental
signals, but in only a few well-studied model species. By considering diversity
in the plant response to the environment as the adaptation of an
information-processing network, new directions can be found for the study of
life-history strategies, trade-offs and evolution in plants.

Crop production needs to increase to secure future food supplies, while reducing 
its impact on ecosystems. Detailed characterization of plant genomes and genetic 
diversity is crucial for meeting these challenges. Advances in genome sequencing 
and assembly are being used to access the large and complex genomes of crops and 
their wild relatives. These have helped to identify a wide spectrum of genetic
variation and permitted the association of genetic diversity with diverse
agronomic phenotypes. In combination with improved and automated phenotyping
assays and functional genomic studies, genomics is providing new foundations for 
crop-breeding systems.

Plants encounter a myriad of microorganisms, particularly at the root-soil
interface, that can invade with detrimental or beneficial outcomes. Prevalent
beneficial associations between plants and microorganisms include those that
promote plant growth by facilitating the acquisition of limiting nutrients such
as nitrogen and phosphorus. But while promoting such symbiotic relationships,
plants must restrict the formation of pathogenic associations. Achieving this
balance requires the perception of potential invading microorganisms through the 
signals that they produce, followed by the activation of either symbiotic
responses that promote microbial colonization or immune responses that limit it.

Aviation-related aerosol emissions contribute to the formation of contrail cirrus
clouds that can alter upper tropospheric radiation and water budgets, and
therefore climate. The magnitude of air-traffic-related aerosol-cloud
interactions and the ways in which these interactions might change in the future 
remain uncertain. Modelling studies of the present and future effects of aviation
on climate require detailed information about the number of aerosol particles
emitted per kilogram of fuel burned and the microphysical properties of those
aerosols that are relevant for cloud formation. However, previous observational
data at cruise altitudes are sparse for engines burning conventional fuels, and
no data have previously been reported for biofuel use in-flight. Here we report
observations from research aircraft that sampled the exhaust of engines onboard a
NASA DC-8 aircraft as they burned conventional Jet A fuel and a 50:50 (by volume)
blend of Jet A fuel and a biofuel derived from Camelina oil. We show that,
compared to using conventional fuels, biofuel blending reduces particle number
and mass emissions immediately behind the aircraft by 50 to 70 per cent. Our
observations quantify the impact of biofuel blending on aerosol emissions at
cruise conditions and provide key microphysical parameters, which will be useful 
to assess the potential of biofuel use in aviation as a viable strategy to
mitigate climate change.

Successful delivery of the United Nations sustainable development goals and
implementation of the Paris Agreement requires technologies that utilize a wide
range of minerals in vast quantities. Metal recycling and technological change
will contribute to sustaining supply, but mining must continue and grow for the
foreseeable future to ensure that such minerals remain available to industry. New
links are needed between existing institutional frameworks to oversee responsible
sourcing of minerals, trajectories for mineral exploration, environmental
practices, and consumer awareness of the effects of consumption. Here we present,
through analysis of a comprehensive set of data and demand forecasts, an
interdisciplinary perspective on how best to ensure ecologically viable
continuity of global mineral supply over the coming decades.

Photosynthesis is the natural process that converts solar photons into
energy-rich products that are needed to drive the biochemistry of life. Two
ultrafast processes form the basis of photosynthesis: excitation energy transfer 
and charge separation. Under optimal conditions, every photon that is absorbed is
used by the photosynthetic organism. Fundamental quantum mechanics phenomena,
including delocalization, underlie the speed, efficiency and directionality of
the charge-separation process. At least four design principles are active in
natural photosynthesis, and these can be applied practically to stimulate the
development of bio-inspired, human-made energy conversion systems.

Modern nanoelectronics has advanced to a point at which it is impossible to image
entire devices and their interconnections non-destructively because of their
small feature sizes and the complex three-dimensional structures resulting from
their integration on a chip. This metrology gap implies a lack of direct feedback
between design and manufacturing processes, and hampers quality control during
production, shipment and use. Here we demonstrate that X-ray ptychography-a
high-resolution coherent diffractive imaging technique-can create
three-dimensional images of integrated circuits of known and unknown designs with
a lateral resolution in all directions down to 14.6 nanometres. We obtained
detailed device geometries and corresponding elemental maps, and show how the
devices are integrated with each other to form the chip. Our experiments
represent a major advance in chip inspection and reverse engineering over the
traditional destructive electron microscopy and ion milling techniques.
Foreseeable developments in X-ray sources, optics and detectors, as well as
adoption of an instrument geometry optimized for planar rather than cylindrical
samples, could lead to a thousand-fold increase in efficiency, with concomitant
reductions in scan times and voxel sizes.

The geodynamic environment in which Earth's first continents formed and were
stabilized remains controversial. Most exposed continental crust that can be
dated back to the Archaean eon (4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago) comprises
tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite rocks (TTGs) that were formed through partial 
melting of hydrated low-magnesium basaltic rocks; notably, these TTGs have
'arc-like' signatures of trace elements and thus resemble the continental crust
produced in modern subduction settings. In the East Pilbara Terrane, Western
Australia, low-magnesium basalts of the Coucal Formation at the base of the
Pilbara Supergroup have trace-element compositions that are consistent with these
being source rocks for TTGs. These basalts may be the remnants of a thick (more
than 35 kilometres thick), ancient (more than 3.5 billion years old) basaltic
crust that is predicted to have existed if Archaean mantle temperatures were much
hotter than today's. Here, using phase equilibria modelling of the Coucal
basalts, we confirm their suitability as TTG 'parents', and suggest that TTGs
were produced by around 20 per cent to 30 per cent melting of the Coucal basalts 
along high geothermal gradients (of more than 700 degrees Celsius per
gigapascal). We also analyse the trace-element composition of the Coucal basalts,
and propose that these rocks were themselves derived from an earlier generation
of high-magnesium basaltic rocks, suggesting that the arc-like signature in
Archaean TTGs was inherited from an ancestral source lineage. This protracted,
multistage process for the production and stabilization of the first
continents-coupled with the high geothermal gradients-is incompatible with
modern-style plate tectonics, and favours instead the formation of TTGs near the 
base of thick, plateau-like basaltic crust. Thus subduction was not required to
produce TTGs in the early Archaean eon.

The genus Wolbachia is an archetype of maternally inherited intracellular
bacteria that infect the germline of numerous invertebrate species worldwide.
They can selfishly alter arthropod sex ratios and reproductive strategies to
increase the proportion of the infected matriline in the population. The most
common reproductive manipulation is cytoplasmic incompatibility, which results in
embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females.
Females infected with the same Wolbachia strain rescue this lethality. Despite
more than 40 years of research and relevance to symbiont-induced speciation, as
well as control of arbovirus vectors and agricultural pests, the bacterial genes 
underlying cytoplasmic incompatibility remain unknown. Here we use comparative
and transgenic approaches to demonstrate that two differentially transcribed,
co-diverging genes in the eukaryotic association module of prophage WO from
Wolbachia strain wMel recapitulate and enhance cytoplasmic incompatibility. Dual 
expression in transgenic, uninfected males of Drosophila melanogaster crossed to 
uninfected females causes embryonic lethality. Each gene additively augments
embryonic lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females.
Lethality associates with embryonic defects that parallel those of wild-type
cytoplasmic incompatibility and is notably rescued by wMel-infected embryos in
all cases. The discovery of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor genes cifA and
cifB pioneers genetic studies of prophage WO-induced reproductive manipulations
and informs the continuing use of Wolbachia to control dengue and Zika virus
transmission to humans.

With age, haematopoietic stem cells lose their ability to regenerate the blood
system, and promote disease development. Autophagy is associated with health and 
longevity, and is critical for protecting haematopoietic stem cells from
metabolic stress. Here we show that loss of autophagy in haematopoietic stem
cells causes accumulation of mitochondria and an activated metabolic state, which
drives accelerated myeloid differentiation mainly through epigenetic
deregulations, and impairs haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal activity and
regenerative potential. Strikingly, most haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice
share these altered metabolic and functional features. However, approximately
one-third of aged haematopoietic stem cells exhibit high autophagy levels and
maintain a low metabolic state with robust long-term regeneration potential
similar to healthy young haematopoietic stem cells. Our results demonstrate that 
autophagy actively suppresses haematopoietic stem-cell metabolism by clearing
active, healthy mitochondria to maintain quiescence and stemness, and becomes
increasingly necessary with age to preserve the regenerative capacity of old
haematopoietic stem cells.

Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often
exploit chromatin machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs.
Recognition of modified histones by 'reader' proteins constitutes a key mechanism
underlying these processes; therefore, targeting such pathways holds clinical
promise, as exemplified by the development of bromodomain and extra-terminal
(BET) inhibitors. We recently identified the YEATS domain as an
acetyl-lysine-binding module, but its functional importance in human cancer
remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS domain-containing protein ENL, but
not its paralogue AF9, is required for disease maintenance in acute myeloid
leukaemia. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukaemic effects,
including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia
growth in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and
chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analyses revealed that ENL
binds to acetylated histone H3, and co-localizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the
promoters of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemia.
Disrupting the interaction between the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via
structure-based mutagenesis reduced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to
ENL-target genes, leading to the suppression of oncogenic gene expression
programs. Notably, disrupting the functionality of ENL further sensitized
leukaemia cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our data identify ENL as a histone
acetylation reader that regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in acute
myeloid leukaemia, and suggest that displacement of ENL from chromatin may be a
promising epigenetic therapy, alone or in combination with BET inhibitors, for
aggressive leukaemia.

Recurrent chromosomal translocations producing a chimaeric MLL oncogene give rise
to a highly aggressive acute leukaemia associated with poor clinical outcome. The
preferential involvement of chromatin-associated factors as MLL fusion partners
belies a dependency on transcription control. Despite recent progress made in
targeting chromatin regulators in cancer, available therapies for this
well-characterized disease remain inadequate, prompting the need to identify new 
targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, using unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 technology
to perform a genome-scale loss-of-function screen in an MLL-AF4-positive acute
leukaemia cell line, we identify ENL as an unrecognized gene that is specifically
required for proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To explain the mechanistic role 
of ENL in leukaemia pathogenesis and dynamic transcription control, a chemical
genetic strategy was developed to achieve targeted protein degradation. Acute
loss of ENL suppressed the initiation and elongation of RNA polymerase II at
active genes genome-wide, with pronounced effects at genes featuring a
disproportionate ENL load. Notably, an intact YEATS chromatin-reader domain was
essential for ENL-dependent leukaemic growth. Overall, these findings identify a 
dependency factor in acute leukaemia and suggest a mechanistic rationale for
disrupting the YEATS domain in disease.

The nuclear lamina is a fundamental constituent of metazoan nuclei. It is
composed mainly of lamins, which are intermediate filament proteins that assemble
into a filamentous meshwork, bridging the nuclear envelope and chromatin. Besides
providing structural stability to the nucleus, the lamina is involved in many
nuclear activities, including chromatin organization, transcription and
replication. However, the structural organization of the nuclear lamina is poorly
understood. Here we use cryo-electron tomography to obtain a detailed view of the
organization of the lamin meshwork within the lamina. Data analysis of individual
lamin filaments resolves a globular-decorated fibre appearance and shows that A- 
and B-type lamins assemble into tetrameric filaments of 3.5 nm thickness. Thus,
lamins exhibit a structure that is remarkably different from the other canonical 
cytoskeletal elements. Our findings define the architecture of the nuclear lamin 
meshworks at molecular resolution, providing insights into their role in
scaffolding the nuclear lamina.

P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair
protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for
sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP)
inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand
breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20
of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor
interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain 
and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits
RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However,
overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to
double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble
fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring
53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand
break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine
binding function of 53BP1.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are largely heterogeneous and functionally
uncharacterized. Here, using FANTOM5 cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) data,
we integrate multiple transcript collections to generate a comprehensive atlas of
27,919 human lncRNA genes with high-confidence 5' ends and expression profiles
across 1,829 samples from the major human primary cell types and tissues. Genomic
and epigenomic classification of these lncRNAs reveals that most intergenic
lncRNAs originate from enhancers rather than from promoters. Incorporating
genetic and expression data, we show that lncRNAs overlapping trait-associated
single nucleotide polymorphisms are specifically expressed in cell types relevant
to the traits, implicating these lncRNAs in multiple diseases. We further
demonstrate that lncRNAs overlapping expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTL)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms of messenger RNAs are
co-expressed with the corresponding messenger RNAs, suggesting their potential
roles in transcriptional regulation. Combining these findings with conservation
data, we identify 19,175 potentially functional lncRNAs in the human genome.

Lanthanide-doped glasses and crystals are attractive for laser applications
because the metastable energy levels of the trivalent lanthanide ions facilitate 
the establishment of population inversion and amplified stimulated emission at
relatively low pump power. At the nanometre scale, lanthanide-doped upconversion 
nanoparticles (UCNPs) can now be made with precisely controlled phase, dimension 
and doping level. When excited in the near-infrared, these UCNPs emit stable,
bright visible luminescence at a variety of selectable wavelengths, with
single-nanoparticle sensitivity, which makes them suitable for advanced
luminescence microscopy applications. Here we show that UCNPs doped with high
concentrations of thulium ions (Tm3+), excited at a wavelength of 980 nanometres,
can readily establish a population inversion on their intermediate metastable 3H4
level: the reduced inter-emitter distance at high Tm3+ doping concentration leads
to intense cross-relaxation, inducing a photon-avalanche-like effect that rapidly
populates the metastable 3H4 level, resulting in population inversion relative to
the 3H6 ground level within a single nanoparticle. As a result, illumination by a
laser at 808 nanometres, matching the upconversion band of the 3H4 → 3H6
transition, can trigger amplified stimulated emission to discharge the 3H4
intermediate level, so that the upconversion pathway to generate blue
luminescence can be optically inhibited. We harness these properties to realize
low-power super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and
achieve nanometre-scale optical resolution (nanoscopy), imaging single UCNPs; the
resolution is 28 nanometres, that is, 1/36th of the wavelength. These engineered 
nanocrystals offer saturation intensity two orders of magnitude lower than those 
of fluorescent probes currently employed in stimulated emission depletion
microscopy, suggesting a new way of alleviating the square-root law that
typically limits the resolution that can be practically achieved by such
techniques.

Organelles display characteristic morphologies that are intimately tied to their 
cellular function, but how organelles are shaped is poorly understood. The
endoplasmic reticulum is particularly intriguing, as it comprises morphologically
distinct domains, including a dynamic network of interconnected membrane tubules.
Several membrane proteins have been implicated in network formation, but how
exactly they mediate network formation and whether they are all required are
unclear. Here we reconstitute a dynamic tubular membrane network with purified
endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Proteoliposomes containing the membrane-fusing
GTPase Sey1p (refs 6, 7) and the curvature-stabilizing protein Yop1p (refs 8, 9) 
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae form a tubular network upon addition of GTP. The
tubules rapidly fragment when GTP hydrolysis of Sey1p is inhibited, indicating
that network maintenance requires continuous membrane fusion and that Yop1p
favours the generation of highly curved membrane structures. Sey1p also forms
networks with other curvature-stabilizing proteins, including reticulon and
receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEPs) from different species. Atlastin, 
the vertebrate orthologue of Sey1p, forms a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent network on
its own, serving as both a fusion and curvature-stabilizing protein. Our results 
show that organelle shape can be generated by a surprisingly small set of
proteins and represents an energy-dependent steady state between formation and
disassembly.

Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells persist indefinitely in epithelial barrier
tissues and protect the host against pathogens. However, the biological pathways 
that enable the long-term survival of TRM cells are obscure. Here we show that
mouse CD8+ TRM cells generated by viral infection of the skin differentially
express high levels of several molecules that mediate lipid uptake and
intracellular transport, including fatty-acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and
FABP5). We further show that T-cell-specific deficiency of Fabp4 and Fabp5
(Fabp4/Fabp5) impairs exogenous free fatty acid (FFA) uptake by CD8+ TRM cells
and greatly reduces their long-term survival in vivo, while having no effect on
the survival of central memory T (TCM) cells in lymph nodes. In vitro, CD8+ TRM
cells, but not CD8+ TCM cells, demonstrated increased mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism in the presence of exogenous FFAs; this increase was not seen in
Fabp4/Fabp5 double-knockout CD8+ TRM cells. The persistence of CD8+ TRM cells in 
the skin was strongly diminished by inhibition of mitochondrial FFA β-oxidation
in vivo. Moreover, skin CD8+ TRM cells that lacked Fabp4/Fabp5 were less
effective at protecting mice from cutaneous viral infection, and lung Fabp4/Fabp5
double-knockout CD8+ TRM cells generated by skin vaccinia virus (VACV) infection 
were less effective at protecting mice from a lethal pulmonary challenge with
VACV. Consistent with the mouse data, increased FABP4 and FABP5 expression and
enhanced extracellular FFA uptake were also demonstrated in human CD8+ TRM cells 
in normal and psoriatic skin. These results suggest that FABP4 and FABP5 have a
critical role in the maintenance, longevity and function of CD8+ TRM cells, and
suggest that CD8+ TRM cells use exogenous FFAs and their oxidative metabolism to 
persist in tissue and to mediate protective immunity.

The semiconductor industry is increasingly of the view that Moore's law-which
predicts the biennial doubling of the number of transistors per microprocessor
chip-is nearing its end. Consequently, the pursuit of alternative semiconducting 
materials for nanoelectronic devices, including single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs), continues. Arrays of horizontal nanotubes are particularly appealing for
technological applications because they optimize current output. However, the
direct growth of horizontal SWNT arrays with controlled chirality, that would
enable the arrays to be adapted for a wider range of applications and ensure the 
uniformity of the fabricated devices, has not yet been achieved. Here we show
that horizontal SWNT arrays with predicted chirality can be grown from the
surfaces of solid carbide catalysts by controlling the symmetries of the active
catalyst surface. We obtained horizontally aligned metallic SWNT arrays with an
average density of more than 20 tubes per micrometre in which 90 per cent of the 
tubes had chiral indices of (12, 6), and semiconducting SWNT arrays with an
average density of more than 10 tubes per micrometre in which 80 per cent of the 
nanotubes had chiral indices of (8, 4). The nanotubes were grown using uniform
size Mo2C and WC solid catalysts. Thermodynamically, the SWNT was selectively
nucleated by matching its structural symmetry and diameter with those of the
catalyst. We grew nanotubes with chiral indices of (2m, m) (where m is a positive
integer), the yield of which could be increased by raising the concentration of
carbon to maximize the kinetic growth rate in the chemical vapour deposition
process. Compared to previously reported methods, such as cloning, seeding and
specific-structure-matching growth, our strategy of controlling the
thermodynamics and kinetics offers more degrees of freedom, enabling the
chirality of as-grown SWNTs in an array to be tuned, and can also be used to
predict the growth conditions required to achieve the desired chiralities.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a pandemic associated with severe
neuropathology in newborns and adults. There are no ZIKV-specific treatments or
preventatives. Therefore, the development of a safe and effective vaccine is a
high priority. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a versatile and highly
effective platform to deliver vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins. Here we 
demonstrate that a single low-dose intradermal immunization with
lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the 
pre-membrane and envelope glycoproteins of a strain from the ZIKV outbreak in
2013 elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice and
non-human primates. Immunization with 30 μg of nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNP 
protected mice against ZIKV challenges at 2 weeks or 5 months after vaccination, 
and a single dose of 50 μg was sufficient to protect non-human primates against a
challenge at 5 weeks after vaccination. These data demonstrate that
nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP elicits rapid and durable protective immunity and
therefore represents a new and promising vaccine candidate for the global fight
against ZIKV.

The single-atom bit represents the ultimate limit of the classical approach to
high-density magnetic storage media. So far, the smallest individually
addressable bistable magnetic bits have consisted of 3-12 atoms. Long magnetic
relaxation times have been demonstrated for single lanthanide atoms in molecular 
magnets, for lanthanides diluted in bulk crystals, and recently for ensembles of 
holmium (Ho) atoms supported on magnesium oxide (MgO). These experiments suggest 
a path towards data storage at the atomic limit, but the way in which individual 
magnetic centres are accessed remains unclear. Here we demonstrate the reading
and writing of the magnetism of individual Ho atoms on MgO, and show that they
independently retain their magnetic information over many hours. We read the Ho
states using tunnel magnetoresistance and write the states with current pulses
using a scanning tunnelling microscope. The magnetic origin of the long-lived
states is confirmed by single-atom electron spin resonance on a nearby iron
sensor atom, which also shows that Ho has a large out-of-plane moment of
10.1 ± 0.1 Bohr magnetons on this surface. To demonstrate independent reading and
writing, we built an atomic-scale structure with two Ho bits, to which we write
the four possible states and which we read out both magnetoresistively and
remotely by electron spin resonance. The high magnetic stability combined with
electrical reading and writing shows that single-atom magnetic memory is indeed
possible.

Understanding quantum dynamics away from equilibrium is an outstanding challenge 
in the modern physical sciences. Out-of-equilibrium systems can display a rich
variety of phenomena, including self-organized synchronization and dynamical
phase transitions. More recently, advances in the controlled manipulation of
isolated many-body systems have enabled detailed studies of non-equilibrium
phases in strongly interacting quantum matter; for example, the interplay between
periodic driving, disorder and strong interactions has been predicted to result
in exotic 'time-crystalline' phases, in which a system exhibits temporal
correlations at integer multiples of the fundamental driving period, breaking the
discrete time-translational symmetry of the underlying drive. Here we report the 
experimental observation of such discrete time-crystalline order in a driven,
disordered ensemble of about one million dipolar spin impurities in diamond at
room temperature. We observe long-lived temporal correlations, experimentally
identify the phase boundary and find that the temporal order is protected by
strong interactions. This order is remarkably stable to perturbations, even in
the presence of slow thermalization. Our work opens the door to exploring
dynamical phases of matter and controlling interacting, disordered many-body
systems.

There are many unanswered questions about the evolution of the ancient 'Silk
Roads' across Asia. This is especially the case in their mountainous stretches,
where harsh terrain is seen as an impediment to travel. Considering the ecology
and mobility of inner Asian mountain pastoralists, we use 'flow accumulation'
modelling to calculate the annual routes of nomadic societies (from 750 m to
4,000 m elevation). Aggregating 500 iterations of the model reveals a
high-resolution flow network that simulates how centuries of seasonal nomadic
herding could shape discrete routes of connectivity across the mountains of Asia.
We then compare the locations of known high-elevation Silk Road sites with the
geography of these optimized herding flows, and find a significant correspondence
in mountainous regions. Thus, we argue that highland Silk Road networks (from
750 m to 4,000 m) emerged slowly in relation to long-established mobility
patterns of nomadic herders in the mountains of inner Asia.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many areas of physics, 
including cosmology, particle physics and condensed matter. An example is the
breaking of spatial translational symmetry, which underlies the formation of
crystals and the phase transition from liquid to solid. Using the analogy of
crystals in space, the breaking of translational symmetry in time and the
emergence of a 'time crystal' was recently proposed, but was later shown to be
forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems, which
are subject to a periodic drive, can exhibit persistent time correlations at an
emergent subharmonic frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a
'discrete time crystal'. Here we present the experimental observation of a
discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. We
apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body localization
conditions, and observe a subharmonic temporal response that is robust to
external perturbations. The observation of such a time crystal opens the door to 
the study of systems with long-range spatio-temporal correlations and novel
phases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions.

Methane biogenesis in methanogens is mediated by methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an 
enzyme that is also responsible for the utilization of methane through anaerobic 
methane oxidation. The enzyme uses an ancillary factor called coenzyme F430, a
nickel-containing modified tetrapyrrole that promotes catalysis through a methyl 
radical/Ni(ii)-thiolate intermediate. However, it is unclear how coenzyme F430 is
synthesized from the common primogenitor uroporphyrinogen iii, incorporating 11
steric centres into the macrocycle, although the pathway must involve chelation, 
amidation, macrocyclic ring reduction, lactamization and carbocyclic ring
formation. Here we identify the proteins that catalyse the biosynthesis of
coenzyme F430 from sirohydrochlorin, termed CfbA-CfbE, and demonstrate their
activity. The research completes our understanding of how the repertoire of
tetrapyrrole-based pigments are constructed, permitting the development of
recombinant systems to use these metalloprosthetic groups more widely.

The Earth's core is about ten per cent less dense than pure iron (Fe), suggesting
that it contains light elements as well as iron. Modelling of core formation at
high pressure (around 40-60 gigapascals) and high temperature (about 3,500
kelvin) in a deep magma ocean predicts that both silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) are 
among the impurities in the liquid outer core. However, only the binary systems
Fe-Si and Fe-O have been studied in detail at high pressures, and little is known
about the compositional evolution of the Fe-Si-O ternary alloy under core
conditions. Here we performed melting experiments on liquid Fe-Si-O alloy at core
pressures in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. Our results demonstrate that the 
liquidus field of silicon dioxide (SiO2) is unexpectedly wide at the iron-rich
portion of the Fe-Si-O ternary, such that an initial Fe-Si-O core crystallizes
SiO2 as it cools. If crystallization proceeds on top of the core, the buoyancy
released should have been more than sufficient to power core convection and a
dynamo, in spite of high thermal conductivity, from as early on as the Hadean
eon. SiO2 saturation also sets limits on silicon and oxygen concentrations in the
present-day outer core.

In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides. Methylation of
the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA
methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that,
in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation
protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic
transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate 
that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment 
to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be
degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to
the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins. Elongating RNA polymerase II therefore
triggers an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism that involves SetD2, H3K36me3, Dnmt3b 
and DNA methylation to ensure the fidelity of gene transcription initiation, with
implications for intragenic hypomethylation in cancer.

Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect and
reprogram T cells to mediate tumour rejection. The most successful CARs used to
date are those targeting CD19 (ref. 2), which offer the prospect of complete
remission in patients with chemorefractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. CARs 
are typically transduced into the T cells of a patient using γ-retroviral vectors
or other randomly integrating vectors, which may result in clonal expansion,
oncogenic transformation, variegated transgene expression and transcriptional
silencing. Recent advances in genome editing enable efficient sequence-specific
interventions in human cells, including targeted gene delivery to the CCR5 and
AAVS1 loci. Here we show that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell
receptor α constant (TRAC) locus not only results in uniform CAR expression in
human peripheral blood T cells, but also enhances T-cell potency, with edited
cells vastly outperforming conventionally generated CAR T cells in a mouse model 
of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We further demonstrate that targeting the CAR
to the TRAC locus averts tonic CAR signalling and establishes effective
internalization and re-expression of the CAR following single or repeated
exposure to antigen, delaying effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion.
These findings uncover facets of CAR immunobiology and underscore the potential
of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to advance immunotherapies.

Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in GBA1, which encodes the lysosomal
enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA1 mutations drive extensive accumulation of
glucosylceramide (GC) in multiple innate and adaptive immune cells in the spleen,
liver, lung and bone marrow, often leading to chronic inflammation. The
mechanisms that connect excess GC to tissue inflammation remain unknown. Here we 
show that activation of complement C5a and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) controls GC
accumulation and the inflammatory response in experimental and clinical Gaucher
disease. Marked local and systemic complement activation occurred in
GCase-deficient mice or after pharmacological inhibition of GCase and was
associated with GC storage, tissue inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine
production. Whereas all GCase-inhibited mice died within 4-5 weeks, mice
deficient in both GCase and C5aR1, and wild-type mice in which GCase and C5aR
were pharmacologically inhibited, were protected from these adverse effects and
consequently survived. In mice and humans, GCase deficiency was associated with
strong formation of complement-activating GC-specific IgG autoantibodies, leading
to complement activation and C5a generation. Subsequent C5aR1 activation
controlled UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase production, thereby tipping
the balance between GC formation and degradation. Thus, extensive GC storage
induces complement-activating IgG autoantibodies that drive a pathway of C5a
generation and C5aR1 activation that fuels a cycle of cellular GC accumulation,
innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment and activation in Gaucher disease. As
enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapies are expensive and still
associated with inflammation, increased risk of cancer and Parkinson disease,
targeting C5aR1 may serve as a treatment option for patients with Gaucher disease
and, possibly, other lysosomal storage diseases.

The prefrontal cortex is a critical neuroanatomical hub for controlling motivated
behaviours across mammalian species. In addition to intra-cortical connectivity, 
prefrontal projection neurons innervate subcortical structures that contribute to
reward-seeking behaviours, such as the ventral striatum and midline thalamus.
While connectivity among these structures contributes to appetitive behaviours,
how projection-specific prefrontal neurons encode reward-relevant information to 
guide reward seeking is unknown. Here we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging
to monitor the activity of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons in mice during an
appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task. At the population level, these neurons
display diverse activity patterns during the presentation of reward-predictive
cues. However, recordings from prefrontal neurons with resolved projection
targets reveal that individual corticostriatal neurons show response tuning to
reward-predictive cues, such that excitatory cue responses are amplified across
learning. By contrast, corticothalamic neurons gradually develop new, primarily
inhibitory responses to reward-predictive cues across learning. Furthermore,
bidirectional optogenetic manipulation of these neurons reveals that stimulation 
of corticostriatal neurons promotes conditioned reward-seeking behaviour after
learning, while activity in corticothalamic neurons suppresses both the
acquisition and expression of conditioned reward seeking. These data show how
prefrontal circuitry can dynamically control reward-seeking behaviour through the
opposing activities of projection-specific cell populations.

Photosystem II (PSII) is a huge membrane-protein complex consisting of 20
different subunits with a total molecular mass of 350 kDa for a monomer. It
catalyses light-driven water oxidation at its catalytic centre, the
oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The structure of PSII has been analysed at 1.9 Å
resolution by synchrotron radiation X-rays, which revealed that the OEC is a
Mn4CaO5 cluster organized in an asymmetric, 'distorted-chair' form. This
structure was further analysed with femtosecond X-ray free electron lasers
(XFEL), providing the 'radiation damage-free' structure. The mechanism of O=O
bond formation, however, remains obscure owing to the lack of intermediate-state 
structures. Here we describe the structural changes in PSII induced by two-flash 
illumination at room temperature at a resolution of 2.35 Å using time-resolved
serial femtosecond crystallography with an XFEL provided by the SPring-8 ångström
compact free-electron laser. An isomorphous difference Fourier map between the
two-flash and dark-adapted states revealed two areas of apparent changes: around 
the QB/non-haem iron and the Mn4CaO5 cluster. The changes around the QB/non-haem 
iron region reflected the electron and proton transfers induced by the two-flash 
illumination. In the region around the OEC, a water molecule located 3.5 Å from
the Mn4CaO5 cluster disappeared from the map upon two-flash illumination. This
reduced the distance between another water molecule and the oxygen atom O4,
suggesting that proton transfer also occurred. Importantly, the
two-flash-minus-dark isomorphous difference Fourier map showed an apparent
positive peak around O5, a unique μ4-oxo-bridge located in the quasi-centre of
Mn1 and Mn4 (refs 4,5). This suggests the insertion of a new oxygen atom (O6)
close to O5, providing an O=O distance of 1.5 Å between these two oxygen atoms.
This provides a mechanism for the O=O bond formation consistent with that
proposed previously.

The diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs) is increasing owing 
to more sensitive detection methods, and this increase is creating challenges for
clinical management. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 102 primary PanNETs 
and defined the genomic events that characterize their pathogenesis. Here we
describe the mutational signatures they harbour, including a deficiency in
G:C > T:A base excision repair due to inactivation of MUTYH, which encodes a DNA 
glycosylase. Clinically sporadic PanNETs contain a larger-than-expected
proportion of germline mutations, including previously unreported mutations in
the DNA repair genes MUTYH, CHEK2 and BRCA2. Together with mutations in MEN1 and 
VHL, these mutations occur in 17% of patients. Somatic mutations, including point
mutations and gene fusions, were commonly found in genes involved in four main
pathways: chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair, activation of mTOR signalling
(including previously undescribed EWSR1 gene fusions), and telomere maintenance. 
In addition, our gene expression analyses identified a subgroup of tumours
associated with hypoxia and HIF signalling.

Despite acting as a barrier for the organs they encase, epithelial cells turn
over at some of the fastest rates in the body. However, epithelial cell division 
must be tightly linked to cell death to preserve barrier function and prevent
tumour formation. How does the number of dying cells match those dividing to
maintain constant numbers? When epithelial cells become too crowded, they
activate the stretch-activated channel Piezo1 to trigger extrusion of cells that 
later die. However, it is unclear how epithelial cell division is controlled to
balance cell death at the steady state. Here we show that mammalian epithelial
cell division occurs in regions of low cell density where cells are stretched. By
experimentally stretching epithelia, we find that mechanical stretch itself
rapidly stimulates cell division through activation of the Piezo1 channel. To
stimulate cell division, stretch triggers cells that are paused in early G2 phase
to activate calcium-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby activating the
cyclin B transcription that is necessary to drive cells into mitosis. Although
both epithelial cell division and cell extrusion require Piezo1 at the steady
state, the type of mechanical force controls the outcome: stretch induces cell
division, whereas crowding induces extrusion. How Piezo1-dependent calcium
transients activate two opposing processes may depend on where and how Piezo1 is 
activated, as it accumulates in different subcellular sites with increasing cell 
density. In sparse epithelial regions in which cells divide, Piezo1 localizes to 
the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, whereas in dense regions in which cells
extrude, it forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. Because Piezo1 senses both
mechanical crowding and stretch, it may act as a homeostatic sensor to control
epithelial cell numbers, triggering extrusion and apoptosis in crowded regions
and cell division in sparse regions.

disomy.

Uniparental disomy (UPD), in which an individual contains a pair of homologous
chromosomes originating from only one parent, is a frequent phenomenon that is
linked to congenital disorders and various cancers. UPD is thought to result
mostly from pre- or post-zygotic chromosome missegregation. However, the factors 
that drive UPD remain unknown. Here we use the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces 
pombe as a model to investigate UPD, and show that defects in the RNA
interference (RNAi) machinery or in the YTH domain-containing RNA elimination
factor Mmi1 cause high levels of UPD in vegetative diploid cells. This phenomenon
is not due to defects in heterochromatin assembly at centromeres. Notably, in
cells lacking RNAi components or Mmi1, UPD is associated with the untimely
expression of gametogenic genes. Deletion of the upregulated gene encoding the
meiotic cohesin Rec8 or the cyclin Crs1 suppresses UPD in both RNAi and mmi1
mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Rec8 is sufficient to trigger UPD in
wild-type cells. Rec8 expressed in vegetative cells localizes to chromosomal arms
and to the centromere core, where it is required for localization of the cohesin 
subunit Psc3. The centromeric localization of Rec8 and Psc3 promotes UPD by
uniquely affecting chromosome segregation, causing a reductional segregation of
one homologue. Together, these findings establish the untimely vegetative
expression of gametogenic genes as a causative factor of UPD, and provide a solid
foundation for understanding this phenomenon, which is linked to diverse human
diseases.

Human cells have twenty-three pairs of chromosomes. In cancer, however, genes can
be amplified in chromosomes or in circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), although
the frequency and functional importance of ecDNA are not understood. We performed
whole-genome sequencing, structural modelling and cytogenetic analyses of 17
different cancer types, including analysis of the structure and function of
chromosomes during metaphase of 2,572 dividing cells, and developed a software
package called ECdetect to conduct unbiased, integrated ecDNA detection and
analysis. Here we show that ecDNA was found in nearly half of human cancers; its 
frequency varied by tumour type, but it was almost never found in normal cells.
Driver oncogenes were amplified most commonly in ecDNA, thereby increasing
transcript level. Mathematical modelling predicted that ecDNA amplification would
increase oncogene copy number and intratumoural heterogeneity more effectively
than chromosomal amplification. We validated these predictions by quantitative
analyses of cancer samples. The results presented here suggest that ecDNA
contributes to accelerated evolution in cancer.

prisms interlaced with a soft protein matrix. This structural motif is unusually 
consistent across all species from all geological eras. Such
invariability-especially when juxtaposed with the diversity of other
tissues-suggests the existence of a functional basis. Here we performed ex vivo
replication of enamel-inspired columnar nanocomposites by sequential growth of
zinc oxide nanowire carpets followed by layer-by-layer deposition of a polymeric 
matrix around these. We show that the mechanical properties of these
nanocomposites, including hardness, are comparable to those of enamel despite the
nanocomposites having a smaller hard-phase content. Our abiotic enamels have
viscoelastic figures of merit (VFOM) and weight-adjusted VFOM that are similar
to, or higher than, those of natural tooth enamels-we achieve values that exceed 
the traditional materials limits of 0.6 and 0.8, respectively. VFOM values
describe resistance to vibrational damage, and our columnar composites
demonstrate that light-weight materials of unusually high resistance to
structural damage from shocks, environmental vibrations and oscillatory stress
can be made using biomimetic design. The previously inaccessible combinations of 
high stiffness, damping and light weight that we achieve in these layer-by-layer 
composites are attributed to efficient energy dissipation in the interfacial
portion of the organic phase. The in vivo contribution of this interfacial
portion to macroscale deformations along the tooth's normal is maximized when the
architecture is columnar, suggesting an evolutionary advantage of the columnar
motif in the enamel of living species. We expect our findings to apply to all
columnar composites and to lead to the development of high-performance
load-bearing materials.

The concept of a supersolid state combines the crystallization of a many-body
system with dissipationless flow of the atoms from which it is built. This
quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous symmetries: the phase
invariance of a superfluid and the continuous translational invariance to form
the crystal. Despite having been proposed for helium almost 50 years ago,
experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A variant with only
discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed lattice structure-the
'lattice supersolid'-has been realized, based on self-organization of a
Bose-Einstein condensate. However, lattice supersolids do not feature the
continuous ground-state degeneracy that characterizes the supersolid state as
originally proposed. Here we report the realization of a supersolid with
continuous translational symmetry breaking along one direction in a quantum gas. 
The continuous symmetry that is broken emerges from two discrete spatial
symmetries by symmetrically coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate to the modes of
two optical cavities. We establish the phase coherence of the supersolid and find
a high ground-state degeneracy by measuring the crystal position over many
realizations through the light fields that leak from the cavities. These light
fields are also used to monitor the position fluctuations in real time. Our
concept provides a route to creating and studying glassy many-body systems with
controllably lifted ground-state degeneracies, such as supersolids in the
presence of disorder.

The micronutrient iron is now recognized to be important in regulating the
magnitude and dynamics of ocean primary productivity, making it an integral
component of the ocean's biogeochemical cycles. In this Review, we discuss how a 
recent increase in observational data for this trace metal has challenged the
prevailing view of the ocean iron cycle. Instead of focusing on dust as the major
iron source and emphasizing iron's tight biogeochemical coupling to major
nutrients, a more complex and diverse picture of the sources of iron, its cycling
processes and intricate linkages with the ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles has
emerged.

The brightness of an active galactic nucleus is set by the gas falling onto it
from the galaxy, and the gas infall rate is regulated by the brightness of the
active galactic nucleus; this feedback loop is the process by which supermassive 
black holes in the centres of galaxies may moderate the growth of their hosts.
Gas outflows (in the form of disk winds) release huge quantities of energy into
the interstellar medium, potentially clearing the surrounding gas. The most
extreme (in terms of speed and energy) of these-the ultrafast outflows-are the
subset of X-ray-detected outflows with velocities higher than 10,000 kilometres
per second, believed to originate in relativistic (that is, near the speed of
light) disk winds a few hundred gravitational radii from the black hole. The
absorption features produced by these outflows are variable, but no clear link
has been found between the behaviour of the X-ray continuum and the velocity or
optical depth of the outflows, owing to the long timescales of quasar
variability. Here we report the observation of multiple absorption lines from an 
extreme ultrafast gas flow in the X-ray spectrum of the active galactic nucleus
IRAS 13224-3809, at 0.236 ± 0.006 times the speed of light (71,000 kilometres per
second), where the absorption is strongly anti-correlated with the emission of
X-rays from the inner regions of the accretion disk. If the gas flow is
identified as a genuine outflow then it is in the fastest five per cent of such
winds, and its variability is hundreds of times faster than in other variable
winds, allowing us to observe in hours what would take months in a quasar. We
find X-ray spectral signatures of the wind simultaneously in both low- and
high-energy detectors, suggesting a single ionized outflow, linking the low- and 
high-energy absorption lines. That this disk wind is responding to the emission
from the inner accretion disk demonstrates a connection between accretion
processes occurring on very different scales: the X-ray emission from within a
few gravitational radii of the black hole ionizing the disk wind hundreds of
gravitational radii further away as the X-ray flux rises.

Supersolidity combines superfluid flow with long-range spatial periodicity of
solids, two properties that are often mutually exclusive. The original discussion
of quantum crystals and supersolidity focused on solid 4He and triggered
extensive experimental efforts that, instead of supersolidity, revealed exotic
phenomena including quantum plasticity and mass supertransport. The concept of
supersolidity was then generalized from quantum crystals to other superfluid
systems that break continuous translational symmetry. Bose-Einstein condensates
with spin-orbit coupling are predicted to possess a stripe phase with supersolid 
properties. Despite several recent studies of the miscibility of the spin
components of such a condensate, the presence of stripes has not been detected.
Here we observe the predicted density modulation of this stripe phase using Bragg
reflection (which provides evidence for spontaneous long-range order in one
direction) while maintaining a sharp momentum distribution (the hallmark of
superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates). Our work thus establishes a system with
continuous symmetry-breaking properties, associated collective excitations and
superfluid behaviour.

Although it is not known when or where life on Earth began, some of the earliest 
habitable environments may have been submarine-hydrothermal vents. Here we
describe putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3,770 million and
possibly 4,280 million years old in ferruginous sedimentary rocks, interpreted as
seafloor-hydrothermal vent-related precipitates, from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in
Quebec, Canada. These structures occur as micrometre-scale haematite tubes and
filaments with morphologies and mineral assemblages similar to those of
filamentous microorganisms from modern hydrothermal vent precipitates and
analogous microfossils in younger rocks. The Nuvvuagittuq rocks contain
isotopically light carbon in carbonate and carbonaceous material, which occurs as
graphitic inclusions in diagenetic carbonate rosettes, apatite blades intergrown 
among carbonate rosettes and magnetite-haematite granules, and is associated with
carbonate in direct contact with the putative microfossils. Collectively, these
observations are consistent with an oxidized biomass and provide evidence for
biological activity in submarine-hydrothermal environments more than 3,770
million years ago.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B-cell-specific enzyme that
targets immunoglobulin genes to initiate class switch recombination and somatic
hypermutation. In addition, through off-target activity, AID has a much broader
effect on genomic instability by initiating oncogenic chromosomal translocations 
and mutations involved in the development and progression of lymphoma. AID
expression is tightly regulated in B cells and its overexpression leads to
enhanced genomic instability and lymphoma formation. The phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) pathway regulates AID by suppressing its expression in B
cells. Drugs for leukaemia or lymphoma therapy such as idelalisib, duvelisib and 
ibrutinib block PI3Kδ activity directly or indirectly, potentially affecting AID 
expression and, consequently, genomic stability in B cells. Here we show that
treatment of primary mouse B cells with idelalisib or duvelisib, and to a lesser 
extent ibrutinib, enhanced the expression of AID and increased somatic
hypermutation and chromosomal translocation frequency to the Igh locus and to
several AID off-target sites. Both of these effects were completely abrogated in 
AID-deficient B cells. PI3Kδ inhibitors or ibrutinib increased the formation of
AID-dependent tumours in pristane-treated mice. Consistently, PI3Kδ inhibitors
enhanced AID expression and translocation frequency to IGH and AID off-target
sites in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines,
and patients treated with idelalisib, but not ibrutinib, showed increased somatic
hypermutation in AID off-targets. In summary, we show that PI3Kδ or Bruton's
tyrosine kinase inhibitors increase genomic instability in normal and neoplastic 
B cells by an AID-dependent mechanism. This effect should be carefully
considered, as such inhibitors can be administered to patients for years.

A highly protective malaria vaccine would greatly facilitate the prevention and
elimination of malaria and containment of drug-resistant parasites. A high level 
(more than 90%) of protection against malaria in humans has previously been
achieved only by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) inoculated by mosquitoes; by intravenous injection of
aseptic, purified, radiation-attenuated, cryopreserved PfSPZ ('PfSPZ Vaccine');
or by infectious PfSPZ inoculated by mosquitoes to volunteers taking chloroquine 
or mefloquine (chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites). We assessed immunization by
direct venous inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, non-irradiated
PfSPZ ('PfSPZ Challenge') to malaria-naive, healthy adult volunteers taking
chloroquine for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (vaccine approach denoted as
PfSPZ-CVac). Three doses of 5.12 × 104 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge at 28-day
intervals were well tolerated and safe, and prevented infection in 9 out of 9
(100%) volunteers who underwent controlled human malaria infection ten weeks
after the last dose (group III). Protective efficacy was dependent on dose and
regimen. Immunization with 3.2 × 103 (group I) or 1.28 × 104 (group II) PfSPZ
protected 3 out of 9 (33%) or 6 out of 9 (67%) volunteers, respectively. Three
doses of 5.12 × 104 PfSPZ at five-day intervals protected 5 out of 8 (63%)
volunteers. The frequency of Pf-specific polyfunctional CD4 memory T cells was
associated with protection. On a 7,455 peptide Pf proteome array, immune sera
from at least 5 out of 9 group III vaccinees recognized each of 22 proteins.
PfSPZ-CVac is a highly efficacious vaccine candidate; when we are able to
optimize the immunization regimen (dose, interval between doses, and drug
partner), this vaccine could be used for combination mass drug administration and
a mass vaccination program approach to eliminate malaria from geographically
defined areas.

Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and has a role in the regulation
of metabolism through the release of adipokines. Here we show that mice with an
adipose-tissue-specific knockout of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer 
(ADicerKO), as well as humans with lipodystrophy, exhibit a substantial decrease 
in levels of circulating exosomal miRNAs. Transplantation of both white and brown
adipose tissue-brown especially-into ADicerKO mice restores the level of numerous
circulating miRNAs that are associated with an improvement in glucose tolerance
and a reduction in hepatic Fgf21 mRNA and circulating FGF21. This gene regulation
can be mimicked by the administration of normal, but not ADicerKO, serum
exosomes. Expression of a human-specific miRNA in the brown adipose tissue of one
mouse in vivo can also regulate its 3' UTR reporter in the liver of another mouse
through serum exosomal transfer. Thus, adipose tissue constitutes an important
source of circulating exosomal miRNAs, which can regulate gene expression in
distant tissues and thereby serve as a previously undescribed form of adipokine.

B-lymphoid transcription factors, such as PAX5 and IKZF1, are critical for early 
B-cell development, yet lesions of the genes encoding these transcription factors
occur in over 80% of cases of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The
importance of these lesions in ALL has, until now, remained unclear. Here, by
combining studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing and RNA
sequencing, we identify a novel B-lymphoid program for transcriptional repression
of glucose and energy supply. Our metabolic analyses revealed that PAX5 and IKZF1
enforce a state of chronic energy deprivation, resulting in constitutive
activation of the energy-stress sensor AMPK. Dominant-negative mutants of PAX5
and IKZF1, however, relieved this glucose and energy restriction. In a transgenic
pre-B ALL mouse model, the heterozygous deletion of Pax5 increased glucose uptake
and ATP levels by more than 25-fold. Reconstitution of PAX5 and IKZF1 in samples 
from patients with pre-B ALL restored a non-permissive state and induced energy
crisis and cell death. A CRISPR/Cas9-based screen of PAX5 and IKZF1
transcriptional targets identified the products of NR3C1 (encoding the
glucocorticoid receptor), TXNIP (encoding a glucose-feedback sensor) and CNR2
(encoding a cannabinoid receptor) as central effectors of B-lymphoid restriction 
of glucose and energy supply. Notably, transport-independent lipophilic
methyl-conjugates of pyruvate and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites bypassed
the gatekeeper function of PAX5 and IKZF1 and readily enabled leukaemic
transformation. Conversely, pharmacological TXNIP and CNR2 agonists and a
small-molecule AMPK inhibitor strongly synergized with glucocorticoids,
identifying TXNIP, CNR2 and AMPK as potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore,
our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the empirical finding that
glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of B-lymphoid but not myeloid
malignancies. Thus, B-lymphoid transcription factors function as metabolic
gatekeepers by limiting the amount of cellular ATP to levels that are
insufficient for malignant transformation.

The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is one of the most profound and tightly 
orchestrated processes during the early life of embryos, yet factors that shape
the temporal pattern of vertebrate MZT are largely unknown. Here we show that
over one-third of zebrafish maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modified, and the clearance of these maternal mRNAs is
facilitated by an m6A-binding protein, Ythdf2. Removal of Ythdf2 in zebrafish
embryos decelerates the decay of m6A-modified maternal mRNAs and impedes zygotic 
genome activation. These embryos fail to initiate timely MZT, undergo cell-cycle 
pause, and remain developmentally delayed throughout larval life. Our study
reveals m6A-dependent RNA decay as a previously unidentified maternally driven
mechanism that regulates maternal mRNA clearance during zebrafish MZT,
highlighting the critical role of m6A mRNA methylation in transcriptome switching
and animal development.

Reciprocity is a general, fundamental principle governing various physical
systems, which ensures that the transfer function-the transmission of a physical 
quantity, say light intensity-between any two points in space is identical,
regardless of geometrical or material asymmetries. Breaking this transmission
symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation and source
protection. So far, devices that break reciprocity (and therefore show
non-reciprocity) have been mostly considered in dynamic systems involving
electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical wave propagation associated with fields 
varying in space and time. Here we show that it is possible to break reciprocity 
in static systems, realizing mechanical metamaterials that exhibit vastly
different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well as 
one-way displacement amplification. This is achieved by combining large
nonlinearities with suitable geometrical asymmetries and/or topological features.
In addition to extending non-reciprocity and isolation to statics, our work sheds
light on energy propagation in nonlinear materials with asymmetric crystalline
structures and topological properties. We anticipate that breaking reciprocity
will open avenues for energy absorption, conversion and harvesting, soft
robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics.

The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different
types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and
provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell
types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly
deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging
light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals 
in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated
by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The
resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields
interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. 
Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating
functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of
parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse
visual system.

Synthetic lethality and collateral lethality are two well-validated conceptual
strategies for identifying therapeutic targets in cancers with tumour-suppressor 
gene deletions. Here, we explore an approach to identify potential
synthetic-lethal interactions by screening mutually exclusive deletion patterns
in cancer genomes. We sought to identify 'synthetic-essential' genes: those that 
are occasionally deleted in some cancers but are almost always retained in the
context of a specific tumour-suppressor deficiency. We also posited that such
synthetic-essential genes would be therapeutic targets in cancers that harbour
specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies. In addition to known synthetic-lethal
interactions, this approach uncovered the chromatin helicase DNA-binding factor
CHD1 as a putative synthetic-essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancers. In
PTEN-deficient prostate and breast cancers, CHD1 depletion profoundly and
specifically suppressed cell proliferation, cell survival and tumorigenic
potential. Mechanistically, functional PTEN stimulates the GSK3β-mediated
phosphorylation of CHD1 degron domains, which promotes CHD1 degradation via the
β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Conversely, PTEN deficiency
results in stabilization of CHD1, which in turn engages the trimethyl lysine-4
histone H3 modification to activate transcription of the pro-tumorigenic
TNF-NF-κB gene network. This study identifies a novel PTEN pathway in cancer and 
provides a framework for the discovery of 'trackable' targets in cancers that
harbour specific tumour-suppressor deficiencies.

Exceptionally preserved fossils provide crucial insights into extinct body plans 
and organismal evolution. Molluscs, one of the most disparate animal phyla,
radiated rapidly during the early Cambrian period (approximately 535-520 million 
years ago (Ma)). The problematic fossil taxa Halkieria and Orthrozanclus (grouped
in Sachitida) have been assigned variously to stem-group annelids, brachiopods,
stem-group molluscs or stem-group aculiferans (Polyplacophora and Aplacophora),
but their affinities have remained controversial owing to a lack of preserved
diagnostic characters. Here we describe a new early sachitid, Calvapilosa
kroegeri gen. et sp. nov. from the Fezouata biota of Morocco (Early Ordovician
epoch, around 478 Ma). The new taxon is characterized by the presence of a single
large anterior shell plate and polystichous radula bearing a median tooth and
several lateral and uncinal teeth in more than 125 rows. Its flattened body is
covered by hollow spinose sclerites, and a smooth, ventral girdle flanks an
extensive mantle cavity. Phylogenetic analyses resolve C. kroegeri as a
stem-group aculiferan together with other single-plated forms such as Maikhanella
(Siphogonuchites) and Orthrozanclus; Halkieria is recovered closer to the
aculiferan crown. These genera document the stepwise evolution of the aculiferan 
body plan from forms with a single, almost conchiferan-like shell through
two-plated taxa such as Halkieria, to the eight-plated crown-group aculiferans.
C. kroegeri therefore provides key evidence concerning the long debate about the 
crown molluscan affinities of sachitids. This new discovery strongly suggests
that the possession of only a single calcareous shell plate and the presence of
unmineralised sclerites are plesiomorphic (an ancestral trait) for the molluscan 
crown.

The rise of oxygen on the early Earth (about 2.4 billion years ago) caused a
reorganization of marine nutrient cycles, including that of nitrogen, which is
important for controlling global primary productivity. However, current
geochemical records lack the temporal resolution to address the nature and timing
of the biogeochemical response to oxygenation directly. Here we couple records of
ocean redox chemistry with nitrogen isotope (15N/14N) values from approximately
2.31-billion-year-old shales of the Rooihoogte and Timeball Hill formations in
South Africa, deposited during the early stages of the first rise in atmospheric 
oxygen on the Earth (the Great Oxidation Event). Our data fill a gap of about 400
million years in the temporal 15N/14N record and provide evidence for the
emergence of a pervasive aerobic marine nitrogen cycle. The interpretation of our
nitrogen isotope data in the context of iron speciation and carbon isotope data
suggests biogeochemical cycling across a dynamic redox boundary, with primary
productivity fuelled by chemoautotrophic production and a nitrogen cycle
dominated by nitrogen loss processes using newly available marine oxidants. This 
chemostratigraphic trend constrains the onset of widespread nitrate availability 
associated with ocean oxygenation. The rise of marine nitrate could have allowed 
for the rapid diversification and proliferation of nitrate-using cyanobacteria
and, potentially, eukaryotic phytoplankton.

The genomes of individuals with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders are
enriched in damaging de novo mutations (DNMs) in developmentally important genes.
Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with
developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another
3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors
influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, 
the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the
parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14
that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental
disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these
disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding
sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the
remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental
disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448
births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this
equates to almost 400,000 children born per year.

In mitosis, for each daughter cell to inherit an accurate copy of the genome from
the mother cell, sister chromatids in the mother cell must attach to microtubules
emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, a process known as
bi-orientation. A surveillance mechanism, termed the spindle assembly checkpoint 
(SAC), monitors the microtubule attachment process and can temporarily halt the
separation of sister chromatids and the completion of mitosis until
bi-orientation is complete. SAC failure results in abnormal chromosome numbers,
termed aneuploidy, in the daughter cells, a hallmark of many tumours. The
HORMA-domain-containing protein mitotic arrest deficient 2 (MAD2) is a subunit of
the SAC effector mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC). Structural conversion from the
open to the closed conformation of MAD2 is required for MAD2 to be incorporated
into the MCC. In vitro, MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly take several hours, but 
in cells the SAC response is established in a few minutes. Here, to address this 
discrepancy, we reconstituted a near-complete SAC signalling system with purified
components and monitored assembly of the MCC in real time. A marked acceleration 
in MAD2 conversion and MCC assembly was observed when monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) 
kinase phosphorylated the MAD1-MAD2 complex, triggering it to act as the template
for MAD2 conversion and therefore contributing to the establishment of a physical
platform for MCC assembly. Thus, catalytic activation of the SAC depends on
regulated protein-protein interactions that accelerate the spontaneous but
rate-limiting conversion of MAD2 required for MCC assembly.

Variations in the Earth's orbit and spin vector are a primary control on
insolation and climate; their recognition in the geological record has
revolutionized our understanding of palaeoclimate dynamics, and has catalysed
improvements in the accuracy and precision of the geological timescale. Yet the
secular evolution of the planetary orbits beyond 50 million years ago remains
highly uncertain, and the chaotic dynamical nature of the Solar System predicted 
by theoretical models has yet to be rigorously confirmed by well constrained
(radioisotopically calibrated and anchored) geological data. Here we present
geological evidence for a chaotic resonance transition associated with
interactions between the orbits of Mars and the Earth, using an integrated
radioisotopic and astronomical timescale from the Cretaceous Western Interior
Basin of what is now North America. This analysis confirms the predicted chaotic 
dynamical behaviour of the Solar System, and provides a constraint for refining
numerical solutions for insolation, which will enable a more precise and accurate
geological timescale to be produced.

One aim of modern astronomy is to detect temperate, Earth-like exoplanets that
are well suited for atmospheric characterization. Recently, three Earth-sized
planets were detected that transit (that is, pass in front of) a star with a mass
just eight per cent that of the Sun, located 12 parsecs away. The transiting
configuration of these planets, combined with the Jupiter-like size of their host
star-named TRAPPIST-1-makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric
properties with present-day and future astronomical facilities. Here we report
the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and
space. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses 
similar to those of Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a
near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1
and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests
that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inwards. Moreover, the
seven planets have equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible the
presence of liquid water on their surfaces.

Nucleic acids undergo naturally occurring chemical modifications. Over 100
different modifications have been described and every position in the purine and 
pyrimidine bases can be modified; often the sugar is also modified. Despite
recent progress, the mechanism for the biosynthesis of most modifications is not 
fully understood, owing, in part, to the difficulty associated with
reconstituting enzyme activity in vitro. Whereas some modifications can be
efficiently formed with purified components, others may require more intricate
pathways. A model for modification interdependence, in which one modification is 
a prerequisite for another, potentially explains a major hindrance in
reconstituting enzymatic activity in vitro. This model was prompted by the
earlier discovery of tRNA cytosine-to-uridine editing in eukaryotes, a reaction
that has not been recapitulated in vitro and the mechanism of which remains
unknown. Here we show that cytosine 32 in the anticodon loop of Trypanosoma
brucei tRNAThr is methylated to 3-methylcytosine (m3C) as a pre-requisite for
C-to-U deamination. Formation of m3C in vitro requires the presence of both the
T. brucei m3C methyltransferase TRM140 and the deaminase ADAT2/3. Once formed,
m3C is deaminated to 3-methyluridine (m3U) by the same set of enzymes. ADAT2/3 is
a highly mutagenic enzyme, but we also show that when co-expressed with the
methyltransferase its mutagenicity is kept in check. This helps to explain how T.
brucei escapes 'wholesale deamination' of its genome while harbouring both
enzymes in the nucleus. This observation has implications for the control of
another mutagenic deaminase, human AID, and provides a rationale for its
regulation.

The pacing of glacial-interglacial cycles during the Quaternary period (the past 
2.6 million years) is attributed to astronomically driven changes in
high-latitude insolation. However, it has not been clear how astronomical forcing
translates into the observed sequence of interglacials. Here we show that before 
one million years ago interglacials occurred when the energy related to summer
insolation exceeded a simple threshold, about every 41,000 years. Over the past
one million years, fewer of these insolation peaks resulted in deglaciation (that
is, more insolation peaks were 'skipped'), implying that the energy threshold for
deglaciation had risen, which led to longer glacials. However, as a glacial
lengthens, the energy needed for deglaciation decreases. A statistical model that
combines these observations correctly predicts every complete deglaciation of the
past million years and shows that the sequence of interglacials that has occurred
is one of a small set of possibilities. The model accounts for the dominance of
obliquity-paced glacial-interglacial cycles early in the Quaternary and for the
change in their frequency about one million years ago. We propose that the
appearance of larger ice sheets over the past million years was a consequence of 
an increase in the deglaciation threshold and in the number of skipped insolation
peaks.

The toxicity of misfolded proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction are pivotal
factors that promote age-associated functional neuronal decline and
neurodegenerative disease. Accordingly, neurons invest considerable cellular
resources in chaperones, protein degradation, autophagy and mitophagy to maintain
proteostasis and mitochondrial quality. Complicating the challenges of
neuroprotection, misfolded human disease proteins and mitochondria can move into 
neighbouring cells via unknown mechanisms, which may promote pathological spread.
Here we show that adult neurons from Caenorhabditis elegans extrude large
(approximately 4 μm) membrane-surrounded vesicles called exophers that can
contain protein aggregates and organelles. Inhibition of chaperone expression,
autophagy or the proteasome, in addition to compromising mitochondrial quality,
enhances the production of exophers. Proteotoxically stressed neurons that
generate exophers subsequently function better than similarly stressed neurons
that did not produce exophers. The extruded exopher transits through surrounding 
tissue in which some contents appear degraded, but some non-degradable materials 
can subsequently be found in more remote cells, suggesting secondary release. Our
observations suggest that exopher-genesis is a potential response to rid cells of
neurotoxic components when proteostasis and organelle function are challenged. We
propose that exophers are components of a conserved mechanism that constitutes a 
fundamental, but formerly unrecognized, branch of neuronal proteostasis and
mitochondrial quality control, which, when dysfunctional or diminished with age, 
might actively contribute to pathogenesis in human neurodegenerative disease and 
brain ageing.

Metabolic pathways that contribute to adiposity and ageing are activated by the
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and p70 ribosomal protein S6
kinase 1 (S6K1) axis. However, known mTORC1-S6K1 targets do not account for
observed loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that there are additional
downstream effectors of this pathway. Here we identify glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA
synthetase (EPRS) as an mTORC1-S6K1 target that contributes to adiposity and
ageing. Phosphorylation of EPRS at Ser999 by mTORC1-S6K1 induces its release from
the aminoacyl tRNA multisynthetase complex, which is required for execution of
noncanonical functions of EPRS beyond protein synthesis. To investigate the
physiological function of EPRS phosphorylation, we generated Eprs knock-in mice
bearing phospho-deficient Ser999-to-Ala (S999A) and phospho-mimetic (S999D)
mutations. Homozygous S999A mice exhibited low body weight, reduced adipose
tissue mass, and increased lifespan, similar to S6K1-deficient mice and mice with
adipocyte-specific deficiency of raptor, an mTORC1 constituent. Substitution of
the EprsS999D allele in S6K1-deficient mice normalized body mass and adiposity,
indicating that EPRS phosphorylation mediates S6K1-dependent metabolic responses.
In adipocytes, insulin stimulated S6K1-dependent EPRS phosphorylation and release
from the multisynthetase complex. Interaction screening revealed that
phospho-EPRS binds SLC27A1 (that is, fatty acid transport protein 1, FATP1),
inducing its translocation to the plasma membrane and long-chain fatty acid
uptake. Thus, EPRS and FATP1 are terminal mTORC1-S6K1 axis effectors that are
critical for metabolic phenotypes.

The detection of infrared radiation enables night vision, health monitoring,
optical communications and three-dimensional object recognition. Silicon is
widely used in modern electronics, but its electronic bandgap prevents the
detection of light at wavelengths longer than about 1,100 nanometres. It is
therefore of interest to extend the performance of silicon photodetectors into
the infrared spectrum, beyond the bandgap of silicon. Here we demonstrate a
photovoltage field-effect transistor that uses silicon for charge transport, but 
is also sensitive to infrared light owing to the use of a quantum dot light
absorber. The photovoltage generated at the interface between the silicon and the
quantum dot, combined with the high transconductance provided by the silicon
device, leads to high gain (more than 104 electrons per photon at 1,500
nanometres), fast time response (less than 10 microseconds) and a widely tunable 
spectral response. Our photovoltage field-effect transistor has a responsivity
that is five orders of magnitude higher at a wavelength of 1,500 nanometres than 
that of previous infrared-sensitized silicon detectors. The sensitization is
achieved using a room-temperature solution process and does not rely on
traditional high-temperature epitaxial growth of semiconductors (such as is used 
for germanium and III-V semiconductors). Our results show that colloidal quantum 
dots can be used as an efficient platform for silicon-based infrared detection,
competitive with state-of-the-art epitaxial semiconductors.

Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa) is a highly nutritious grain identified as an
important crop to improve world food security. Unfortunately, few resources are
available to facilitate its genetic improvement. Here we report the assembly of a
high-quality, chromosome-scale reference genome sequence for quinoa, which was
produced using single-molecule real-time sequencing in combination with optical, 
chromosome-contact and genetic maps. We also report the sequencing of two
diploids from the ancestral gene pools of quinoa, which enables the
identification of sub-genomes in quinoa, and reduced-coverage genome sequences
for 22 other samples of the allotetraploid goosefoot complex. The genome sequence
facilitated the identification of the transcription factor likely to control the 
production of anti-nutritional triterpenoid saponins found in quinoa seeds,
including a mutation that appears to cause alternative splicing and a premature
stop codon in sweet quinoa strains. These genomic resources are an important
first step towards the genetic improvement of quinoa.

Malignant neoplasms evolve in response to changes in oncogenic signalling. Cancer
cell plasticity in response to evolutionary pressures is fundamental to tumour
progression and the development of therapeutic resistance. Here we determine the 
molecular and cellular mechanisms of cancer cell plasticity in a conditional
oncogenic Kras mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a
malignancy that displays considerable phenotypic diversity and morphological
heterogeneity. In this model, stochastic extinction of oncogenic Kras signalling 
and emergence of Kras-independent escaper populations (cells that acquire
oncogenic properties) are associated with de-differentiation and aggressive
biological behaviour. Transcriptomic and functional analyses of Kras-independent 
escapers reveal the presence of Smarcb1-Myc-network-driven mesenchymal
reprogramming and independence from MAPK signalling. A somatic mosaic model of
PDAC, which allows time-restricted perturbation of cell fate, shows that
depletion of Smarcb1 activates the Myc network, driving an anabolic switch that
increases protein metabolism and adaptive activation of
endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-induced survival pathways. Increased protein
turnover renders mesenchymal sub-populations highly susceptible to
pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the cellular proteostatic machinery
and the IRE1-α-MKK4 arm of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response pathway.
Specifically, combination regimens that impair the unfolded protein responses
block the emergence of aggressive mesenchymal subpopulations in mouse and
patient-derived PDAC models. These molecular and biological insights inform a
potential therapeutic strategy for targeting aggressive mesenchymal features of
PDAC.

Helium isotopes provide an important tool for tracing early-Earth, primordial
reservoirs that have survived in the planet's interior. Volcanic hotspot lavas,
like those erupted at Hawaii and Iceland, can host rare, high 3He/4He isotopic
ratios (up to 50 times the present atmospheric ratio, Ra) compared to the lower
3He/4He ratios identified in mid-ocean-ridge basalts that form by melting the
upper mantle (about 8Ra; ref. 5). A long-standing hypothesis maintains that the
high-3He/4He domain resides in the deep mantle, beneath the upper mantle sampled 
by mid-ocean-ridge basalts, and that buoyantly upwelling plumes from the deep
mantle transport high-3He/4He material to the shallow mantle beneath plume-fed
hotspots. One problem with this hypothesis is that, while some hotspots have
3He/4He values ranging from low to high, other hotspots exhibit only low 3He/4He 
ratios. Here we show that, among hotspots suggested to overlie mantle plumes,
those with the highest maximum 3He/4He ratios have high hotspot buoyancy fluxes
and overlie regions with seismic low-velocity anomalies in the upper mantle,
unlike plume-fed hotspots with only low maximum 3He/4He ratios. We interpret the 
relationships between 3He/4He values, hotspot buoyancy flux, and upper-mantle
shear wave velocity to mean that hot plumes-which exhibit seismic low-velocity
anomalies at depths of 200 kilometres-are more buoyant and entrain both
high-3He/4He and low-3He/4He material. In contrast, cooler, less buoyant plumes
do not entrain this high-3He/4He material. This can be explained if the
high-3He/4He domain is denser than low-3He/4He mantle components hosted in
plumes, and if high-3He/4He material is entrained from the deep mantle only by
the hottest, most buoyant plumes. Such a dense, deep-mantle high-3He/4He domain
could remain isolated from the convecting mantle, which may help to explain the
preservation of early Hadean (>4.5 billion years ago) geochemical anomalies in
lavas sampling this reservoir.

The mammalian liver consists of hexagon-shaped lobules that are radially
polarized by blood flow and morphogens. Key liver genes have been shown to be
differentially expressed along the lobule axis, a phenomenon termed zonation, but
a detailed genome-wide reconstruction of this spatial division of labour has not 
been achieved. Here we measure the entire transcriptome of thousands of mouse
liver cells and infer their lobule coordinates on the basis of a panel of zonated
landmark genes, characterized with single-molecule fluorescence in situ
hybridization. Using this approach, we obtain the zonation profiles of all liver 
genes with high spatial resolution. We find that around 50% of liver genes are
significantly zonated and uncover abundant non-monotonic profiles that peak at
the mid-lobule layers. These include a spatial order of bile acid biosynthesis
enzymes that matches their position in the enzymatic cascade. Our approach can
facilitate the reconstruction of similar spatial genomic blueprints for other
mammalian organs.

The origin and expansion of biological diversity is regulated by both
developmental trajectories and limits on available ecological niches. As lineages
diversify, an early and often rapid phase of species and trait proliferation
gives way to evolutionary slow-downs as new species pack into ever more densely
occupied regions of ecological niche space. Small clades such as Darwin's finches
demonstrate that natural selection is the driving force of adaptive radiations,
but how microevolutionary processes scale up to shape the expansion of phenotypic
diversity over much longer evolutionary timescales is unclear. Here we address
this problem on a global scale by analysing a crowdsourced dataset of
three-dimensional scanned bill morphology from more than 2,000 species. We find
that bill diversity expanded early in extant avian evolutionary history, before
transitioning to a phase dominated by packing of morphological space. However,
this early phenotypic diversification is decoupled from temporal variation in
evolutionary rate: rates of bill evolution vary among lineages but are
comparatively stable through time. We find that rare, but major, discontinuities 
in phenotype emerge from rapid increases in rate along single branches, sometimes
leading to depauperate clades with unusual bill morphologies. Despite these jumps
between groups, the major axes of within-group bill-shape evolution are
remarkably consistent across birds. We reveal that macroevolutionary processes
underlying global-scale adaptive radiations support Darwinian and Simpsonian
ideas of microevolution within adaptive zones and accelerated evolution between
distinct adaptive peaks.

During puberty, the mouse mammary gland develops into a highly branched
epithelial network. Owing to the absence of exclusive stem cell markers, the
location, multiplicity, dynamics and fate of mammary stem cells (MaSCs), which
drive branching morphogenesis, are unknown. Here we show that morphogenesis is
driven by proliferative terminal end buds that terminate or bifurcate with near
equal probability, in a stochastic and time-invariant manner, leading to a
heterogeneous epithelial network. We show that the majority of terminal end bud
cells function as highly proliferative, lineage-committed MaSCs that are
heterogeneous in their expression profile and short-term contribution to ductal
extension. Yet, through cell rearrangements during terminal end bud bifurcation, 
each MaSC is able to contribute actively to long-term growth. Our study shows
that the behaviour of MaSCs is not directly linked to a single expression
profile. Instead, morphogenesis relies upon lineage-restricted heterogeneous MaSC
populations that function as single equipotent pools in the long term.

Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles with variable shapes influenced by
metabolic conditions, developmental stage, and environmental stimuli. Their
dynamic morphology is a result of regulated and balanced fusion and fission
processes. Fusion is crucial for the health and physiological functions of
mitochondria, including complementation of damaged mitochondrial DNAs and the
maintenance of membrane potential. Mitofusins are dynamin-related GTPases that
are essential for mitochondrial fusion. They are embedded in the mitochondrial
outer membrane and thought to fuse adjacent mitochondria via combined
oligomerization and GTP hydrolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms of this
process remain unknown. Here we present crystal structures of engineered human
MFN1 containing the GTPase domain and a helical domain during different stages of
GTP hydrolysis. The helical domain is composed of elements from widely dispersed 
sequence regions of MFN1 and resembles the 'neck' of the bacterial dynamin-like
protein. The structures reveal unique features of its catalytic machinery and
explain how GTP binding induces conformational changes to promote GTPase domain
dimerization in the transition state. Disruption of GTPase domain dimerization
abolishes the fusogenic activity of MFN1. Moreover, a conserved aspartate residue
trigger was found to affect mitochondrial elongation in MFN1, probably through a 
GTP-loading-dependent domain rearrangement. Thus, we propose a mechanistic model 
for MFN1-mediated mitochondrial tethering, and our results shed light on the
molecular basis of mitochondrial fusion and mitofusin-related human neuromuscular
disorders.

Spliceosome rearrangements facilitated by RNA helicase PRP16 before catalytic
step two of splicing are poorly understood. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron
microscopy structure of the human spliceosomal C complex stalled directly after
PRP16 action (C*). The architecture of the catalytic U2-U6 ribonucleoprotein
(RNP) core of the human C* spliceosome is very similar to that of the yeast
pre-Prp16 C complex. However, in C* the branched intron region is separated from 
the catalytic centre by approximately 20 Å, and its position close to the U6
small nuclear RNA ACAGA box is stabilized by interactions with the PRP8 RNase
H-like and PRP17 WD40 domains. RNA helicase PRP22 is located about 100 Å from the
catalytic centre, suggesting that it destabilizes the spliced mRNA after step two
from a distance. Comparison of the structure of the yeast C and human C*
complexes reveals numerous RNP rearrangements that are likely to be facilitated
by PRP16, including a large-scale movement of the U2 small nuclear RNP.

The spliceosome excises introns from pre-mRNAs in two sequential
transesterifications-branching and exon ligation-catalysed at a single catalytic 
metal site in U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Recently reported structures of the
spliceosomal C complex with the cleaved 5' exon and lariat-3'-exon bound to the
catalytic centre revealed that branching-specific factors such as Cwc25 lock the 
branch helix into position for nucleophilic attack of the branch adenosine at the
5' splice site. Furthermore, the ATPase Prp16 is positioned to bind and
translocate the intron downstream of the branch point to destabilize
branching-specific factors and release the branch helix from the active site.
Here we present, at 3.8 Å resolution, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a
Saccharomyces cerevisiae spliceosome stalled after Prp16-mediated remodelling but
before exon ligation. While the U6 snRNA catalytic core remains firmly held in
the active site cavity of Prp8 by proteins common to both steps, the branch helix
has rotated by 75° compared to the C complex and is stabilized in a new position 
by Prp17, Cef1 and the reoriented Prp8 RNase H-like domain. This rotation of the 
branch helix removes the branch adenosine from the catalytic core, creates a
space for 3' exon docking, and restructures the pairing of the 5' splice site
with the U6 snRNA ACAGAGA region. Slu7 and Prp18, which promote exon ligation,
bind together to the Prp8 RNase H-like domain. The ATPase Prp22, bound to Prp8 in
place of Prp16, could interact with the 3' exon, suggesting a possible basis for 
mRNA release after exon ligation. Together with the structure of the C complex,
our structure of the C* complex reveals the two major conformations of the
spliceosome during the catalytic stages of splicing.

During the last glacial period, the Laurentide Ice Sheet sporadically discharged 
huge numbers of icebergs through the Hudson Strait into the North Atlantic Ocean,
leaving behind distinct layers of ice-rafted debris in the ocean sediments.
Perplexingly, these massive discharge events-Heinrich events-occurred during the 
cold portion of millennial-scale climate oscillations called Dansgaard-Oeschger
cycles. This is in contrast to the expectation that ice sheets expand in colder
climates and shrink in warmer climates. Here we use an ice sheet model to show
that the magnitude and timing of Heinrich events can be explained by the same
processes that drive the retreat of modern marine-terminating glaciers. In our
model, subsurface ocean warming associated with variations in the overturning
circulation increases underwater melt along the calving face, triggering rapid
margin retreat and increased iceberg discharge. On millennial timescales,
isostatic adjustment causes the bed to uplift, isolating the terminus from
subsurface warming and allowing the ice sheet to advance again until, at its most
advanced position, it is poised for another Heinrich event. This mechanism not
only explains the timing and magnitude of observed Heinrich events, but also
suggests that ice sheets in contact with warming oceans may be vulnerable to
catastrophic collapse even with little atmospheric warming.

A colloidal solution is a homogeneous dispersion of particles or droplets of one 
phase (solute) in a second, typically liquid, phase (solvent). Colloids are
ubiquitous in biological, chemical and technological processes, homogenizing
highly dissimilar constituents. To stabilize a colloidal system against
coalescence and aggregation, the surface of each solute particle is engineered to
impose repulsive forces strong enough to overpower van der Waals attraction and
keep the particles separated from each other. Electrostatic stabilization of
charged solutes works well in solvents with high dielectric constants, such as
water (dielectric constant of 80). In contrast, colloidal stabilization in
solvents with low polarity, such as hexane (dielectric constant of about 2), can 
be achieved by decorating the surface of each particle of the solute with
molecules (surfactants) containing flexible, brush-like chains. Here we report a 
class of colloidal systems in which solute particles (including metals,
semiconductors and magnetic materials) form stable colloids in various molten
inorganic salts. The stability of such colloids cannot be explained by
traditional electrostatic and steric mechanisms. Screening of many solute-solvent
combinations shows that colloidal stability can be traced to the strength of
chemical bonding at the solute-solvent interface. Theoretical analysis and
molecular dynamics modelling suggest that a layer of surface-bound solvent ions
produces long-ranged charge-density oscillations in the molten salt around solute
particles, preventing their aggregation. Colloids composed of inorganic particles
in inorganic melts offer opportunities for introducing colloidal techniques to
solid-state science and engineering applications.

Brain enlargement has been observed in children with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), but the timing of this phenomenon, and the relationship between ASD and
the appearance of behavioural symptoms, are unknown. Retrospective head
circumference and longitudinal brain volume studies of two-year olds followed up 
at four years of age have provided evidence that increased brain volume may
emerge early in development. Studies of infants at high familial risk of autism
can provide insight into the early development of autism and have shown that
characteristic social deficits in ASD emerge during the latter part of the first 
and in the second year of life. These observations suggest that prospective
brain-imaging studies of infants at high familial risk of ASD might identify
early postnatal changes in brain volume that occur before an ASD diagnosis. In
this prospective neuroimaging study of 106 infants at high familial risk of ASD
and 42 low-risk infants, we show that hyperexpansion of the cortical surface area
between 6 and 12 months of age precedes brain volume overgrowth observed between 
12 and 24 months in 15 high-risk infants who were diagnosed with autism at 24
months. Brain volume overgrowth was linked to the emergence and severity of
autistic social deficits. A deep-learning algorithm that primarily uses surface
area information from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain of 6-12-month-old
individuals predicted the diagnosis of autism in individual high-risk children at
24 months (with a positive predictive value of 81% and a sensitivity of 88%).
These findings demonstrate that early brain changes occur during the period in
which autistic behaviours are first emerging.

Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global
ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a
warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep 
ocean. It is thought that such a decline in the oceanic oxygen content could
affect ocean nutrient cycles and the marine habitat, with potentially detrimental
consequences for fisheries and coastal economies. Regional observational data
indicate a continuous decrease in oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations in most
regions of the global ocean, with an increase reported in a few limited areas,
varying by study. Prior work attempting to resolve variations in dissolved oxygen
concentrations at the global scale reported a global oxygen loss of 550 ± 130
teramoles (1012 mol) per decade between 100 and 1,000 metres depth based on a
comparison of data from the 1970s and 1990s. Here we provide a quantitative
assessment of the entire ocean oxygen inventory by analysing dissolved oxygen and
supporting data for the complete oceanic water column over the past 50 years. We 
find that the global oceanic oxygen content of 227.4 ± 1.1 petamoles (1015 mol)
has decreased by more than two per cent (4.8 ± 2.1 petamoles) since 1960, with
large variations in oxygen loss in different ocean basins and at different
depths. We suggest that changes in the upper water column are mostly due to a
warming-induced decrease in solubility and biological consumption. Changes in the
deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi-decadal variability,
oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) recognizes xenobiotics as well as natural
compounds such as tryptophan metabolites, dietary components and
microbiota-derived factors, and it is important for maintenance of homeostasis at
mucosal surfaces. AHR activation induces cytochrome P4501 (CYP1) enzymes, which
oxygenate AHR ligands, leading to their metabolic clearance and detoxification.
Thus, CYP1 enzymes have an important feedback role that curtails the duration of 
AHR signalling, but it remains unclear whether they also regulate AHR ligand
availability in vivo. Here we show that dysregulated expression of Cyp1a1 in mice
depletes the reservoir of natural AHR ligands, generating a quasi AHR-deficient
state. Constitutive expression of Cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted
specifically to intestinal epithelial cells resulted in loss of AHR-dependent
type 3 innate lymphoid cells and T helper 17 cells and increased susceptibility
to enteric infection. The deleterious effects of excessive AHR ligand degradation
on intestinal immune functions could be counter-balanced by increasing the intake
of AHR ligands in the diet. Thus, our data indicate that intestinal epithelial
cells serve as gatekeepers for the supply of AHR ligands to the host and
emphasize the importance of feedback control in modulating AHR pathway
activation.

Molecular mechanism for the regulation of yeast separase by securin.

Separase is a cysteine protease with a crucial role in the dissolution of
cohesion among sister chromatids during chromosome segregation. In human tumours 
separase is overexpressed, making it a potential target for drug discovery. The
protease activity of separase is strictly regulated by the inhibitor securin,
which forms a tight complex with separase and may also stabilize this enzyme.
Separases are large, 140-250-kilodalton enzymes, with an amino-terminal α-helical
region and a carboxy-terminal caspase-like catalytic domain. Although crystal
structures of the C-terminal two domains of separase and low-resolution electron 
microscopy reconstructions of the separase-securin complex have been reported,
the atomic structures of full-length separase and especially the complex with
securin are unknown. Here we report crystal structures at up to 2.6 Å resolution 
of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae separase-securin complex. The α-helical
region of separase (also known as Esp1) contains four domains (I-IV), and a
substrate-binding domain immediately precedes the catalytic domain and has tight 
associations with it. The separase-securin complex assumes a highly elongated
structure. Residues 258-373 of securin (Pds1), named the separase interaction
segment, are primarily in an extended conformation and traverse the entire length
of separase, interacting with all of its domains. Most importantly, residues
258-269 of securin are located in the separase active site, illuminating the
mechanism of inhibition. Biochemical studies confirm the structural observations 
and indicate that contacts outside the separase active site are crucial for
stabilizing the complex, thereby defining an important function for the helical
region of separase.

Both humans and animals seek primary rewards in the environment, even when such
rewards do not correspond to current physiological needs. An example of this is a
dissociation between food-seeking behaviour and metabolic needs, a notoriously
difficult-to-treat symptom of eating disorders. Feeding relies on distinct cell
groups in the hypothalamus, the activity of which also changes in anticipation of
feeding onset. The hypothalamus receives strong descending inputs from the
lateral septum, which is connected, in turn, with cortical networks, but
cognitive regulation of feeding-related behaviours is not yet understood.
Cortical cognitive processing involves gamma oscillations, which support memory, 
attention, cognitive flexibility and sensory responses. These functions
contribute crucially to feeding behaviour by unknown neural mechanisms. Here we
show that coordinated gamma (30-90 Hz) oscillations in the lateral hypothalamus
and upstream brain regions organize food-seeking behaviour in mice.
Gamma-rhythmic input to the lateral hypothalamus from somatostatin-positive
lateral septum cells evokes food approach without affecting food intake.
Inhibitory inputs from the lateral septum enable separate signalling by lateral
hypothalamus neurons according to their feeding-related activity, making them
fire at distinct phases of the gamma oscillation. Upstream, medial prefrontal
cortical projections provide gamma-rhythmic inputs to the lateral septum; these
inputs are causally associated with improved performance in a food-rewarded
learning task. Overall, our work identifies a top-down pathway that uses gamma
synchronization to guide the activity of subcortical networks and to regulate
feeding behaviour by dynamic reorganization of functional cell groups in the
hypothalamus.

Peroxisomes function together with mitochondria in a number of essential
biochemical pathways, from bile acid synthesis to fatty acid oxidation.
Peroxisomes grow and divide from pre-existing organelles, but can also emerge de 
novo in the cell. The physiological regulation of de novo peroxisome biogenesis
remains unclear, and it is thought that peroxisomes emerge from the endoplasmic
reticulum in both mammalian and yeast cells. However, in contrast to the yeast
system, a number of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins are imported into
mitochondria in mammalian cells in the absence of peroxisomes, including Pex3,
Pex12, Pex13, Pex14, Pex26, PMP34 and ALDP. Overall, the mitochondrial
localization of peroxisomal membrane proteins in mammalian cells has largely been
considered a mis-targeting artefact in which de novo biogenesis occurs
exclusively from endoplasmic reticulum-targeted peroxins. Here, in following the 
generation of new peroxisomes within human patient fibroblasts lacking
peroxisomes, we show that the essential import receptors Pex3 and Pex14 target
mitochondria, where they are selectively released into vesicular pre-peroxisomal 
structures. Maturation of pre-peroxisomes containing Pex3 and Pex14 requires
fusion with endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles carrying Pex16, thereby
providing full import competence. These findings demonstrate the hybrid nature of
newly born peroxisomes, expanding their functional links to mitochondria.

Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700
common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so 
far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele
frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2 centimetres per
allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the 
average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare
height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2 centimetres per
allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of
IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth
factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in
monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as
ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and
glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that
sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of
moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that
these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.

The instability and accelerated melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are among the 
foremost elements of contemporary global climate change. The increased freshwater
output from Antarctica is important in determining sea level rise, the fate of
Antarctic sea ice and its effect on the Earth's albedo, ongoing changes in global
deep-ocean ventilation, and the evolution of Southern Ocean ecosystems and carbon
cycling. A key uncertainty in assessing and predicting the impacts of Antarctic
Ice Sheet melting concerns the vertical distribution of the exported meltwater.
This is usually represented by climate-scale models as a near-surface freshwater 
input to the ocean, yet measurements around Antarctica reveal the meltwater to be
concentrated at deeper levels. Here we use observations of the turbulent
properties of the meltwater outflows from beneath a rapidly melting Antarctic ice
shelf to identify the mechanism responsible for the depth of the meltwater. We
show that the initial ascent of the meltwater outflow from the ice shelf cavity
triggers a centrifugal overturning instability that grows by extracting kinetic
energy from the lateral shear of the background oceanic flow. The instability
promotes vigorous lateral export, rapid dilution by turbulent mixing, and finally
settling of meltwater at depth. We use an idealized ocean circulation model to
show that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of Antarctic ice
shelves. Our findings demonstrate that the mechanism producing meltwater at depth
is a dynamically robust feature of Antarctic melting that should be incorporated 
into climate-scale models.

Deuterostomes include the group we belong to (vertebrates) as well as an array of
disparate forms that include echinoderms, hemichordates and more problematic
groups such as vetulicolians and vetulocystids. The Cambrian fossil record is
well-populated with representative examples, but possible intermediates are
controversial and the nature of the original deuterostome remains idealized. Here
we report millimetric fossils, Saccorhytus coronarius nov. gen., nov. sp., from
an Orsten-like Lagerstätte from the earliest Cambrian period of South China,
which stratigraphically are amongst the earliest of deuterostomes. The bag-like
body bears a prominent mouth and associated folds, and behind them up to four
conical openings on either side of the body as well as possible sensory
structures. An anus may have been absent, and correspondingly the lateral
openings probably served to expel water and waste material. This new form has
similarities to both the vetulicolians and vetulocystids and collectively these
findings suggest that a key step in deuterostome evolution was the development of
lateral openings that subsequently were co-opted as pharyngeal gills. Depending
on its exact phylogenetic position, the meiofaunal habit of Saccorhytus may help 
to explain the major gap between divergence times seen in the fossil record and
estimates based on molecular clocks.

Land degradation results in declining biodiversity and the disruption of
ecosystem functioning worldwide, particularly in the tropics. Vegetation
restoration is a common tool used to mitigate these impacts and increasingly aims
to restore ecosystem functions rather than species diversity. However, evidence
from community experiments on the effect of restoration practices on ecosystem
functions is scarce. Pollination is an important ecosystem function and the
global decline in pollinators attenuates the resistance of natural areas and
agro-environments to disturbances. Thus, the ability of pollination functions to 
resist or recover from disturbance (that is, the functional resilience) may be
critical for ensuring a successful restoration process. Here we report the use of
a community field experiment to investigate the effects of vegetation
restoration, specifically the removal of exotic shrubs, on pollination. We
analyse 64 plant-pollinator networks and the reproductive performance of the ten 
most abundant plant species across four restored and four unrestored, disturbed
mountaintop communities. Ecosystem restoration resulted in a marked increase in
pollinator species, visits to flowers and interaction diversity. Interactions in 
restored networks were more generalized than in unrestored networks, indicating a
higher functional redundancy in restored communities. Shifts in interaction
patterns had direct and positive effects on pollination, especially on the
relative and total fruit production of native plants. Pollinator limitation was
prevalent at unrestored sites only, where the proportion of flowers producing
fruit increased with pollinator visitation, approaching the higher levels seen in
restored plant communities. Our results show that vegetation restoration can
improve pollination, suggesting that the degradation of ecosystem functions is at
least partially reversible. The degree of recovery may depend on the state of
degradation before restoration intervention and the proximity to pollinator
source populations in the surrounding landscape. We demonstrate that network
structure is a suitable indicator for pollination quality, highlighting the
usefulness of interaction networks in environmental management.

Islet transplantation is an established therapy for diabetes. We have previously 
shown that rat pancreata can be created from rat pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in
mice through interspecies blastocyst complementation. Although they were
functional and composed of rat-derived cells, the resulting pancreata were of
mouse size, rendering them insufficient for isolating the numbers of islets
required to treat diabetes in a rat model. Here, by performing the reverse
experiment, injecting mouse PSCs into Pdx-1-deficient rat blastocysts, we
generated rat-sized pancreata composed of mouse-PSC-derived cells. Islets
subsequently prepared from these mouse-rat chimaeric pancreata were transplanted 
into mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The transplanted islets
successfully normalized and maintained host blood glucose levels for over 370
days in the absence of immunosuppression (excluding the first 5 days after
transplant). These data provide proof-of-principle evidence for the therapeutic
potential of PSC-derived islets generated by blastocyst complementation in a
xenogeneic host.

Realizing robust quantum phenomena in strongly interacting systems is one of the 
central challenges in modern physical science. Approaches ranging from
topological protection to quantum error correction are currently being explored
across many different experimental platforms, including electrons in
condensed-matter systems, trapped atoms and photons. Although photon-photon
interactions are typically negligible in conventional optical media, strong
interactions between individual photons have recently been engineered in several 
systems. Here, using coherent coupling between light and Rydberg excitations in
an ultracold atomic gas, we demonstrate a controlled and coherent exchange
collision between two photons that is accompanied by a π/2 phase shift. The
effect is robust in that the value of the phase shift is determined by the
interaction symmetry rather than the precise experimental parameters, and in that
it occurs under conditions where photon absorption is minimal. The measured phase
shift of 0.48(3)π is in excellent agreement with a theoretical model. These
observations open a route to realizing robust single-photon switches and
all-optical quantum logic gates, and to exploring novel quantum many-body
phenomena with strongly interacting photons.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) perform critical functions in normal physiology and disease by
associating with Argonaute proteins and downregulating partially complementary
messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Here we use clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome-wide
loss-of-function screening coupled with a fluorescent reporter of miRNA activity 
in human cells to identify new regulators of the miRNA pathway. By using
iterative rounds of screening, we reveal a novel mechanism whereby target
engagement by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) triggers its hierarchical, multi-site
phosphorylation by CSNK1A1 on a set of highly conserved residues (S824-S834),
followed by rapid dephosphorylation by the ANKRD52-PPP6C phosphatase complex.
Although genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that AGO2 phosphorylation on
these residues inhibits target mRNA binding, inactivation of this phosphorylation
cycle globally impairs miRNA-mediated silencing. Analysis of the
transcriptome-wide binding profile of non-phosphorylatable AGO2 reveals a
pronounced expansion of the target repertoire bound at steady-state, effectively 
reducing the active pool of AGO2 on a per-target basis. These findings support a 
model in which an AGO2 phosphorylation cycle stimulated by target engagement
regulates miRNA:target interactions to maintain the global efficiency of
miRNA-mediated silencing.

Collective oscillatory behaviour is ubiquitous in nature, having a vital role in 
many biological processes from embryogenesis and organ development to pace-making
in neuron networks. Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to synchronization 
is essential to the understanding of biological self-organization. Collective
oscillations in biological multicellular systems often arise from long-range
coupling mediated by diffusive chemicals, by electrochemical mechanisms, or by
biomechanical interaction between cells and their physical environment. In these 
examples, the phase of some oscillatory intracellular degree of freedom is
synchronized. Here, in contrast, we report the discovery of a weak
synchronization mechanism that does not require long-range coupling or inherent
oscillation of individual cells. We find that millions of motile cells in dense
bacterial suspensions can self-organize into highly robust collective oscillatory
motion, while individual cells move in an erratic manner, without obvious
periodic motion but with frequent, abrupt and random directional changes. So
erratic are individual trajectories that uncovering the collective oscillations
of our micrometre-sized cells requires individual velocities to be averaged over 
tens or hundreds of micrometres. On such large scales, the oscillations appear to
be in phase and the mean position of cells typically describes a regular elliptic
trajectory. We found that the phase of the oscillations is organized into a
centimetre-scale travelling wave. We present a model of noisy self-propelled
particles with strictly local interactions that accounts faithfully for our
observations, suggesting that self-organized collective oscillatory motion
results from spontaneous chiral and rotational symmetry breaking. These findings 
reveal a previously unseen type of long-range order in active matter systems
(those in which energy is spent locally to produce non-random motion). This
mechanism of collective oscillation may inspire new strategies to control the
self-organization of active matter and swarming robots.

Normal epithelial cells often exert anti-tumour effects against nearby oncogenic 
cells. In the Drosophila imaginal epithelium, clones of oncogenic cells with
loss-of-function mutations in the apico-basal polarity genes scribble or discs
large are actively eliminated by cell competition when surrounded by wild-type
cells. Although c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling plays a crucial role in 
this cell elimination, the initial event, which occurs at the interface between
normal cells and polarity-deficient cells, has not previously been identified.
Here, through a genetic screen in Drosophila, we identify the ligand Sas and the 
receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTP10D as the cell-surface ligand-receptor
system that drives tumour-suppressive cell competition. At the interface between 
the wild-type 'winner' and the polarity-deficient 'loser' clones, winner cells
relocalize Sas to the lateral cell surface, whereas loser cells relocalize PTP10D
there. This leads to the trans-activation of Sas-PTP10D signalling in loser
cells, which restrains EGFR signalling and thereby enables elevated JNK
signalling in loser cells, triggering cell elimination. In the absence of
Sas-PTP10D, elevated EGFR signalling in loser cells switches the role of JNK from
pro-apoptotic to pro-proliferative by inactivating the Hippo pathway, thereby
driving the overgrowth of polarity-deficient cells. These findings uncover the
mechanism by which normal epithelial cells recognize oncogenic polarity-deficient
neighbours to drive cell competition.

CRISPR-Cas systems provide microbes with adaptive immunity by employing short DNA
sequences, termed spacers, that guide Cas proteins to cleave foreign DNA. Class 2
CRISPR-Cas systems are streamlined versions, in which a single RNA-bound Cas
protein recognizes and cleaves target sequences. The programmable nature of these
minimal systems has enabled researchers to repurpose them into a versatile
technology that is broadly revolutionizing biological and clinical research.
However, current CRISPR-Cas technologies are based solely on systems from
isolated bacteria, leaving the vast majority of enzymes from organisms that have 
not been cultured untapped. Metagenomics, the sequencing of DNA extracted
directly from natural microbial communities, provides access to the genetic
material of a huge array of uncultivated organisms. Here, using genome-resolved
metagenomics, we identify a number of CRISPR-Cas systems, including the first
reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life, to our knowledge. This divergent
Cas9 protein was found in little-studied nanoarchaea as part of an active
CRISPR-Cas system. In bacteria, we discovered two previously unknown systems,
CRISPR-CasX and CRISPR-CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet
discovered. Notably, all required functional components were identified by
metagenomics, enabling validation of robust in vivo RNA-guided DNA interference
activity in Escherichia coli. Interrogation of environmental microbial
communities combined with in vivo experiments allows us to access an
unprecedented diversity of genomes, the content of which will expand the
repertoire of microbe-based biotechnologies.

The ocean is the largest sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), having
absorbed roughly 40 per cent of CO2 emissions since the beginning of the
industrial era. Recent data show that oceanic CO2 uptake rates have been growing 
over the past decade, reversing a trend of stagnant or declining carbon uptake
during the 1990s. Here we show that ocean circulation variability is the primary 
driver of these changes in oceanic CO2 uptake over the past several decades. We
use a global inverse model to quantify the mean ocean circulation during the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s, and then estimate the impact of decadal circulation
changes on the oceanic CO2 sink using a carbon cycling model. We find that during
the 1990s an enhanced upper-ocean overturning circulation drove increased
outgassing of natural CO2, thus weakening the global CO2 sink. This trend
reversed during the 2000s as the overturning circulation weakened. Continued
weakening of the upper-ocean overturning is likely to strengthen the CO2 sink in 
the near future by trapping natural CO2 in the deep ocean, but ultimately may
limit oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2.

Proper regulation and management of energy, substrate diversity and quantity, as 
well as macromolecular synthesis and breakdown processes, are fundamental to
cellular and organismal survival and are paramount to health. Cellular and
multicellular organization are defended by the immune response, a robust and
critical system through which self is distinguished from non-self, pathogenic
signals are recognized and eliminated, and tissue homeostasis is safeguarded.
Many layers of evolutionarily conserved interactions occur between immune
response and metabolism. Proper maintenance of this delicate balance is crucial
for health and has important implications for many pathological states such as
obesity, diabetes, and other chronic non-communicable diseases.

Intermediate-mass black holes should help us to understand the evolutionary
connection between stellar-mass and super-massive black holes. However, the
existence of intermediate-mass black holes is still uncertain, and their
formation process is therefore unknown. It has long been suspected that black
holes with masses 100 to 10,000 times that of the Sun should form and reside in
dense stellar systems. Therefore, dedicated observational campaigns have targeted
globular clusters for many decades, searching for signatures of these elusive
objects. All candidate signatures appear radio-dim and do not have the X-ray to
radio flux ratios required for accreting black holes. Based on the lack of an
electromagnetic counterpart, upper limits of 2,060 and 470 solar masses have been
placed on the mass of a putative black hole in 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) from radio
and X-ray observations, respectively. Here we show there is evidence for a
central black hole in 47 Tucanae with a mass of solar masses when the dynamical
state of the globular cluster is probed with pulsars. The existence of an
intermediate-mass black hole in the centre of one of the densest clusters with no
detectable electromagnetic counterpart suggests that the black hole is not
accreting at a sufficient rate to make it electromagnetically bright and
therefore, contrary to expectations, is gas-starved. This intermediate-mass black
hole might be a member of an electromagnetically invisible population of black
holes that grow into supermassive black holes in galaxies.

Integrins are adhesion receptors that transmit force across the plasma membrane
between extracellular ligands and the actin cytoskeleton. In activation of the
transforming growth factor-β1 precursor (pro-TGF-β1), integrins bind to the
prodomain, apply force, and release the TGF-β growth factor. However, we know
little about how integrins bind macromolecular ligands in the extracellular
matrix or transmit force to them. Here we show how integrin αVβ6 binds pro-TGF-β1
in an orientation biologically relevant for force-dependent release of TGF-β from
latency. The conformation of the prodomain integrin-binding motif differs in the 
presence and absence of integrin binding; differences extend well outside the
interface and illustrate how integrins can remodel extracellular matrix.
Remodelled residues outside the interface stabilize the integrin-bound
conformation, adopt a conformation similar to earlier-evolving family members,
and show how macromolecular components outside the binding motif contribute to
integrin recognition. Regions in and outside the highly interdigitated interface 
stabilize a specific integrin/pro-TGF-β orientation that defines the pathway
through these macromolecules which actin-cytoskeleton-generated tensile force
takes when applied through the integrin β-subunit. Simulations of force-dependent
activation of TGF-β demonstrate evolutionary specializations for force
application through the TGF-β prodomain and through the β- and not α-subunit of
the integrin.

Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually,
beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by
dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated
classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the
fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks
across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of
skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using
only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of
129,450 clinical images-two orders of magnitude larger than previous
datasets-consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 
21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two
critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign
seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case 
represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents
the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on 
par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial
intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence
comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices
can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is
projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021
(ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to
vital diagnostic care.

Elucidation of the evolutionary history and interrelatedness of Plasmodium
species that infect humans has been hampered by a lack of genetic information for
three human-infective species: P. malariae and two P. ovale species (P. o.
curtisi and P. o. wallikeri). These species are prevalent across most regions in 
which malaria is endemic and are often undetectable by light microscopy,
rendering their study in human populations difficult. The exact evolutionary
relationship of these species to the other human-infective species has been
contested. Using a new reference genome for P. malariae and a manually curated
draft P. o. curtisi genome, we are now able to accurately place these species
within the Plasmodium phylogeny. Sequencing of a P. malariae relative that
infects chimpanzees reveals similar signatures of selection in the P. malariae
lineage to another Plasmodium lineage shown to be capable of colonization of both
human and chimpanzee hosts. Molecular dating suggests that these host adaptations
occurred over similar evolutionary timescales. In addition to the core genome
that is conserved between species, differences in gene content can be linked to
their specific biology. The genome suggests that P. malariae expresses a family
of heterodimeric proteins on its surface that have structural similarities to a
protein crucial for invasion of red blood cells. The data presented here provide 
insight into the evolution of the Plasmodium genus as a whole.

Temperature is a primary driver of the distribution of biodiversity as well as of
ecosystem boundaries. Declining temperature with increasing elevation in montane 
systems has long been recognized as a major factor shaping plant community
biodiversity, metabolic processes, and ecosystem dynamics. Elevational gradients,
as thermoclines, also enable prediction of long-term ecological responses to
climate warming. One of the most striking manifestations of increasing elevation 
is the abrupt transitions from forest to treeless alpine tundra. However, whether
there are globally consistent above- and belowground responses to these
transitions remains an open question. To disentangle the direct and indirect
effects of temperature on ecosystem properties, here we evaluate replicate
treeline ecotones in seven temperate regions of the world. We find that declining
temperatures with increasing elevation did not affect tree leaf nutrient
concentrations, but did reduce ground-layer community-weighted plant nitrogen,
leading to the strong stoichiometric convergence of ground-layer plant community 
nitrogen to phosphorus ratios across all regions. Further, elevation-driven
changes in plant nutrients were associated with changes in soil organic matter
content and quality (carbon to nitrogen ratios) and microbial properties.
Combined, our identification of direct and indirect temperature controls over
plant communities and soil properties in seven contrasting regions suggests that 
future warming may disrupt the functional properties of montane ecosystems,
particularly where plant community reorganization outpaces treeline advance.

When faced with threat, the survival of an organism is contingent upon the
selection of appropriate active or passive behavioural responses. Freezing is an 
evolutionarily conserved passive fear response that has been used extensively to 
study the neuronal mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning in rodents. However, 
rodents also exhibit active responses such as flight under natural conditions.
The central amygdala (CEA) is a forebrain structure vital for the acquisition and
expression of conditioned fear responses, and the role of specific neuronal
sub-populations of the CEA in freezing behaviour is well-established. Whether the
CEA is also involved in flight behaviour, and how neuronal circuits for active
and passive fear behaviour interact within the CEA, are not yet understood. Here,
using in vivo optogenetics and extracellular recordings of identified cell types 
in a behavioural model in which mice switch between conditioned freezing and
flight, we show that active and passive fear responses are mediated by distinct
and mutually inhibitory CEA neurons. Cells expressing corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF+) mediate conditioned flight, and activation of somatostatin-positive
(SOM+) neurons initiates passive freezing behaviour. Moreover, we find that the
balance between conditioned flight and freezing behaviour is regulated by means
of local inhibitory connections between CRF+ and SOM+ neurons, indicating that
the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to threat is based on
competitive interactions between two defined populations of inhibitory neurons, a
circuit motif allowing for rapid and flexible action selection.

The development of catalyst-controlled stereoselective olefin metathesis
processes has been a pivotal recent advance in chemistry. The incorporation of
appropriate ligands within complexes based on molybdenum, tungsten and ruthenium 
has led to reactivity and selectivity levels that were previously inaccessible.
Here we show that molybdenum monoaryloxide chloride complexes furnish
higher-energy (Z) isomers of trifluoromethyl-substituted alkenes through
cross-metathesis reactions with the commercially available, inexpensive and
typically inert Z-1,1,1,4,4,4-hexafluoro-2-butene. Furthermore, otherwise
inefficient and non-stereoselective transformations with Z-1,2-dichloroethene and
1,2-dibromoethene can be effected with substantially improved efficiency and Z
selectivity. The use of such molybdenum monoaryloxide chloride complexes enables 
the synthesis of representative biologically active molecules and trifluoromethyl
analogues of medicinally relevant compounds. The origins of the activity and
selectivity levels observed, which contradict previously proposed principles, are
elucidated with the aid of density functional theory calculations.

Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves double fertilization, the union 
of two sperm from pollen with two sex cells in the female embryo sac. Modern
plant breeders increasingly seek to circumvent this process to produce doubled
haploid individuals, which derive from the chromosome-doubled cells of the
haploid gametophyte. Doubled haploid production fixes recombinant haploid genomes
in inbred lines, shaving years off the breeding process. Costly,
genotype-dependent tissue culture methods are used in many crops, while
seed-based in vivo doubled haploid systems are rare in nature and difficult to
manage in breeding programmes. The multi-billion-dollar maize hybrid seed
business, however, is supported by industrial doubled haploid pipelines using
intraspecific crosses to in vivo haploid inducer males derived from Stock 6,
first reported in 1959 (ref. 5), followed by colchicine treatment. Despite
decades of use, the mode of action remains controversial. Here we establish,
through fine mapping, genome sequencing, genetic complementation, and gene
editing, that haploid induction in maize (Zea mays) is triggered by a frame-shift
mutation in MATRILINEAL (MTL), a pollen-specific phospholipase, and that novel
edits in MTL lead to a 6.7% haploid induction rate (the percentage of haploid
progeny versus total progeny). Wild-type MTL protein localizes exclusively to
sperm cytoplasm, and pollen RNA-sequence profiling identifies a suite of
pollen-specific genes overexpressed during haploid induction, some of which may
mediate the formation of haploid seed. These findings highlight the importance of
male gamete cytoplasmic components to reproductive success and male genome
transmittance. Given the conservation of MTL in the cereals, this discovery may
enable development of in vivo haploid induction systems to accelerate breeding in
crop plants.

The genome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently contains
deletions of tumour suppressor gene loci, most notably SMAD4, which is
homozygously deleted in nearly one-third of cases. As loss of neighbouring
housekeeping genes can confer collateral lethality, we sought to determine
whether loss of the metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in the SMAD4 locus would 
create cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability upon targeting of its paralogous
isoform ME3. The mitochondrial malic enzymes (ME2 and ME3) are oxidative
decarboxylases that catalyse the conversion of malate to pyruvate and are
essential for NADPH regeneration and reactive oxygen species homeostasis. Here we
show that ME3 depletion selectively kills ME2-null PDAC cells in a manner
consistent with an essential function for ME3 in ME2-null cancer cells.
Mechanistically, integrated metabolomic and molecular investigation of cells
deficient in mitochondrial malic enzymes revealed diminished NADPH production and
consequent high levels of reactive oxygen species. These changes activate AMP
activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn directly suppresses sterol
regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-directed transcription of its
direct targets including the BCAT2 branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2)
gene. BCAT2 catalyses the transfer of the amino group from branched-chain amino
acids to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) thereby regenerating glutamate, which functions
in part to support de novo nucleotide synthesis. Thus, mitochondrial malic enzyme
deficiency, which results in impaired NADPH production, provides a prime
'collateral lethality' therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a substantial
fraction of patients diagnosed with this intractable disease.

Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine: it mediates
responses to pathogens or tissue damage, and drives autoimmune diseases. Little
is known about its role in the nervous system. Here we show that IL-17 has
neuromodulator-like properties in Caenorhabditis elegans. IL-17 can act directly 
on neurons to alter their response properties and contribution to behaviour.
Using unbiased genetic screens, we delineate an IL-17 signalling pathway and show
that it acts in the RMG hub interneurons. Disrupting IL-17 signalling reduces RMG
responsiveness to input from oxygen sensors, and renders sustained escape from
21% oxygen transient and contingent on additional stimuli. Over-activating IL-17 
receptors abnormally heightens responses to 21% oxygen in RMG neurons and whole
animals. IL-17 deficiency can be bypassed by optogenetic stimulation of RMG.
Inducing IL-17 expression in adults can rescue mutant defects within 6 h. These
findings reveal a non-immunological role of IL-17 modulating circuit function and
behaviour.

Cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels are essential for vision and olfaction. They
belong to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily but their activities are
controlled by intracellular cyclic nucleotides instead of transmembrane voltage. 
Here we report a 3.5-Å-resolution single-particle electron cryo-microscopy
structure of a cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel from Caenorhabditis elegans in the
cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-bound open state. The channel has an
unusual voltage-sensor-like domain, accounting for its deficient voltage
dependence. A carboxy-terminal linker connecting S6 and the
cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain interacts directly with both the
voltage-sensor-like domain and the pore domain, forming a gating ring that
couples conformational changes triggered by cyclic nucleotide binding to the
gate. The selectivity filter is lined by the carboxylate side chains of a
functionally important glutamate and three rings of backbone carbonyls. This
structure provides a new framework for understanding mechanisms of ion
permeation, gating and channelopathy of cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and
cyclic nucleotide modulation of related channels.

Discovering ways to control the magnetic state of media with the lowest possible 
production of heat and at the fastest possible speeds is important in the study
of fundamental magnetism, with clear practical potential. In metals, it is
possible to switch the magnetization between two stable states (and thus to
record magnetic bits) using femtosecond circularly polarized laser pulses.
However, the switching mechanisms in these materials are directly related to
laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature. Although several possible
routes for achieving all-optical switching in magnetic dielectrics have been
discussed, no recording has hitherto been demonstrated. Here we describe
ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in transparent films of the
dielectric cobalt-substituted garnet. A single linearly polarized femtosecond
laser pulse resonantly pumps specific d-d transitions in the cobalt ions,
breaking the degeneracy between metastable magnetic states. By changing the
polarization of the laser pulse, we deterministically steer the net magnetization
in the garnet, thus writing '0' and '1' magnetic bits at will. This mechanism
outperforms existing alternatives in terms of the speed of the write-read
magnetic recording event (less than 20 picoseconds) and the unprecedentedly low
heat load (less than 6 joules per cubic centimetre).

Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of Earth's
land surface, but store one-third of soil carbon. Peat soils are formed by the
build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic
conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded
decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp
forests. Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most
extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central
Congo Basin. We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation 
(peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent 
to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began
accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid
conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene. The peatlands
occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and
ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is
relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of
2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area 
of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence
interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the
most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times
the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of
pantropical peat extent. We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 
petagrams (30.6 × 1015 grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence
interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the
above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin. Our
result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical
peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum
estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of
carbon). This stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and any future
reduction in precipitation.

Lymphatic vessels are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and are
critical for health. However, the role of metabolism in lymphatic development has
not yet been elucidated. Here we report that in transgenic mouse models,
LEC-specific loss of CPT1A, a rate-controlling enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation, 
impairs lymphatic development. LECs use fatty acid β-oxidation to proliferate and
for epigenetic regulation of lymphatic marker expression during LEC
differentiation. Mechanistically, the transcription factor PROX1 upregulates
CPT1A expression, which increases acetyl coenzyme A production dependent on fatty
acid β-oxidation. Acetyl coenzyme A is used by the histone acetyltransferase p300
to acetylate histones at lymphangiogenic genes. PROX1-p300 interaction
facilitates preferential histone acetylation at PROX1-target genes. Through this 
metabolism-dependent mechanism, PROX1 mediates epigenetic changes that promote
lymphangiogenesis. Notably, blockade of CPT1 enzymes inhibits injury-induced
lymphangiogenesis, and replenishing acetyl coenzyme A by supplementing acetate
rescues this process in vivo.

Engineered spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in cold-atom systems can enable the study of
new synthetic materials and complex condensed matter phenomena. However,
spontaneous emission in alkali-atom spin-orbit-coupled systems is hindered by
heating, limiting the observation of many-body effects and motivating research
into potential alternatives. Here we demonstrate that spin-orbit-coupled fermions
can be engineered to occur naturally in a one-dimensional optical lattice clock. 
In contrast to previous SOC experiments, here the SOC is both generated and
probed using a direct ultra-narrow optical clock transition between two
electronic orbital states in 87Sr atoms. We use clock spectroscopy to prepare
lattice band populations, internal electronic states and quasi-momenta, and to
produce spin-orbit-coupled dynamics. The exceptionally long lifetime of the
excited clock state (160 seconds) eliminates decoherence and atom loss from
spontaneous emission at all relevant experimental timescales, allowing subsequent
momentum- and spin-resolved in situ probing of the SOC band structure and
eigenstates. We use these capabilities to study Bloch oscillations, spin-momentum
locking and Van Hove singularities in the transition density of states. Our
results lay the groundwork for using fermionic optical lattice clocks to probe
new phases of matter.

CD4+ T cells are central mediators of autoimmune pathology; however, defining
their key effector functions in specific autoimmune diseases remains challenging.
Pathogenic CD4+ T cells within affected tissues may be identified by expression
of markers of recent activation. Here we use mass cytometry to analyse activated 
T cells in joint tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic
immune-mediated arthritis that affects up to 1% of the population. This approach 
revealed a markedly expanded population of PD-1hiCXCR5-CD4+ T cells in synovium
of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, these cells are not exhausted,
despite high PD-1 expression. Rather, using multidimensional cytometry,
transcriptomics, and functional assays, we define a population of PD-1hiCXCR5-
'peripheral helper' T (TPH) cells that express factors enabling B-cell help,
including IL-21, CXCL13, ICOS, and MAF. Like PD-1hiCXCR5+ T follicular helper
cells, TPH cells induce plasma cell differentiation in vitro through IL-21
secretion and SLAMF5 interaction (refs 3, 4). However, global transcriptomics
highlight differences between TPH cells and T follicular helper cells, including 
altered expression of BCL6 and BLIMP1 and unique expression of chemokine
receptors that direct migration to inflamed sites, such as CCR2, CX3CR1, and
CCR5, in TPH cells. TPH cells appear to be uniquely poised to promote B-cell
responses and antibody production within pathologically inflamed non-lymphoid
tissues.

Perfect crystals are rare in nature. Real materials often contain crystal defects
and chemical order/disorder such as grain boundaries, dislocations, interfaces,
surface reconstructions and point defects. Such disruption in periodicity
strongly affects material properties and functionality. Despite rapid development
of quantitative material characterization methods, correlating three-dimensional 
(3D) atomic arrangements of chemical order/disorder and crystal defects with
material properties remains a challenge. On a parallel front, quantum mechanics
calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) have progressed from the
modelling of ideal bulk systems to modelling 'real' materials with dopants,
dislocations, grain boundaries and interfaces; but these calculations rely
heavily on average atomic models extracted from crystallography. To improve the
predictive power of first-principles calculations, there is a pressing need to
use atomic coordinates of real systems beyond average crystallographic
measurements. Here we determine the 3D coordinates of 6,569 iron and 16,627
platinum atoms in an iron-platinum nanoparticle, and correlate chemical
order/disorder and crystal defects with material properties at the single-atom
level. We identify rich structural variety with unprecedented 3D detail including
atomic composition, grain boundaries, anti-phase boundaries, anti-site point
defects and swap defects. We show that the experimentally measured coordinates
and chemical species with 22 picometre precision can be used as direct input for 
DFT calculations of material properties such as atomic spin and orbital magnetic 
moments and local magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This work combines 3D atomic
structure determination of crystal defects with DFT calculations, which is
expected to advance our understanding of structure-property relationships at the 
fundamental level.

Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury
and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of 
reactive astrocytes, which we termed A1, is induced by classically activated
neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1
astrocytes by secreting Il-1α, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are
necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability 
to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and
induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons
in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we 
show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases 
including Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain
why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute
to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and 
provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.

Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called
lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the
lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to
lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the
SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate
lysis-lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage
produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the
medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of
this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found
that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide,
demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions.
We term this communication system the 'arbitrium' system, and further show that
it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the
intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The
arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to 'communicate' with its
predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and
hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle.

The Southern Ocean houses a diverse and productive community of organisms.
Unicellular eukaryotic diatoms are the main primary producers in this
environment, where photosynthesis is limited by low concentrations of dissolved
iron and large seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature and the extent of sea 
ice. How diatoms have adapted to this extreme environment is largely unknown.
Here we present insights into the genome evolution of a cold-adapted diatom from 
the Southern Ocean, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, based on a comparison with
temperate diatoms. We find that approximately 24.7 per cent of the diploid F.
cylindrus genome consists of genetic loci with alleles that are highly divergent 
(15.1 megabases of the total genome size of 61.1 megabases). These divergent
alleles were differentially expressed across environmental conditions, including 
darkness, low iron, freezing, elevated temperature and increased CO2. Alleles
with the largest ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions
also show the most pronounced condition-dependent expression, suggesting a
correlation between diversifying selection and allelic differentiation. Divergent
alleles may be involved in adaptation to environmental fluctuations in the
Southern Ocean.

Large interannual variations in the measured growth rate of atmospheric carbon
dioxide (CO2) originate primarily from fluctuations in carbon uptake by land
ecosystems. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent temperature and water
availability control the carbon balance of land ecosystems across spatial and
temporal scales. Here we use empirical models based on eddy covariance data and
process-based models to investigate the effect of changes in temperature and
water availability on gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem
respiration (TER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at local and global scales. We
find that water availability is the dominant driver of the local interannual
variability in GPP and TER. To a lesser extent this is true also for NEE at the
local scale, but when integrated globally, temporal NEE variability is mostly
driven by temperature fluctuations. We suggest that this apparent paradox can be 
explained by two compensatory water effects. Temporal water-driven GPP and TER
variations compensate locally, dampening water-driven NEE variability. Spatial
water availability anomalies also compensate, leaving a dominant temperature
signal in the year-to-year fluctuations of the land carbon sink. These findings
help to reconcile seemingly contradictory reports regarding the importance of
temperature and water in controlling the interannual variability of the
terrestrial carbon balance. Our study indicates that spatial climate covariation 
drives the global carbon cycle response.

Quality control mechanisms intervene appropriately when defective translation
events occur, in order to preserve the integrity of protein synthesis. Rescue of 
ribosomes translating on messenger RNAs that lack stop codons is one of the
co-translational quality control pathways. In many bacteria, ArfA recognizes
stalled ribosomes and recruits the release factor RF2, which catalyses the
termination of protein synthesis. Although an induced-fit mechanism of nonstop
mRNA surveillance mediated by ArfA and RF2 has been reported, the molecular
interaction between ArfA and RF2 in the ribosome that is responsible for the
mechanism is unknown. Here we report an electron cryo-microscopy structure of
ArfA and RF2 in complex with the 70S ribosome bound to a nonstop mRNA. The
structure, which is consistent with our kinetic and biochemical data, reveals the
molecular interactions that enable ArfA to specifically recruit RF2, not RF1,
into the ribosome and to enable RF2 to release the truncated protein product in
this co-translational quality control pathway. The positively charged C-terminal 
domain of ArfA anchors in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome. Furthermore,
binding of ArfA and RF2 induces conformational changes in the ribosomal decoding 
centre that are similar to those seen in other protein-involved decoding
processes. Specific interactions between residues in the N-terminal domain of
ArfA and RF2 help RF2 to adopt a catalytically competent conformation for peptide
release. Our findings provide a framework for understanding recognition of the
translational state of the ribosome by new proteins, and expand our knowledge of 
the decoding potential of the ribosome.

We are just beginning to understand how translational control affects tumour
initiation and malignancy. Here we use an epidermis-specific, in vivo ribosome
profiling strategy to investigate the translational landscape during the
transition from normal homeostasis to malignancy. Using a mouse model of
inducible SOX2, which is broadly expressed in oncogenic RAS-associated cancers,
we show that despite widespread reductions in translation and protein synthesis, 
certain oncogenic mRNAs are spared. During tumour initiation, the translational
apparatus is redirected towards unconventional upstream initiation sites,
enhancing the translational efficiency of oncogenic mRNAs. An in vivo RNA
interference screen of translational regulators revealed that depletion of
conventional eIF2 complexes has adverse effects on normal but not oncogenic
growth. Conversely, the alternative initiation factor eIF2A is essential for
cancer progression, during which it mediates initiation at these upstream sites, 
differentially skewing translation and protein expression. Our findings unveil a 
role for the translation of 5' untranslated regions in cancer, and expose new
targets for therapeutic intervention.

The critical role in surface reactions and heterogeneous catalysis of metal atoms
with low coordination numbers, such as found at atomic steps and surface defects,
is firmly established. But despite the growing availability of tools that enable 
detailed in situ characterization, so far it has not been possible to document
this role directly. Surface properties can be mapped with high spatial
resolution, and catalytic conversion can be tracked with a clear chemical
signature; however, the combination of the two, which would enable
high-spatial-resolution detection of reactions on catalytic surfaces, has rarely 
been achieved. Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to image
and characterize single turnover sites at catalytic surfaces, but is restricted
to reactions that generate highly fluorescing product molecules. Herein the
chemical conversion of N-heterocyclic carbene molecules attached to catalytic
particles is mapped using synchrotron-radiation-based infrared nanospectroscopy
with a spatial resolution of 25 nanometres, which enabled particle regions that
differ in reactivity to be distinguished. These observations demonstrate that,
compared to the flat regions on top of the particles, the peripheries of the
particles-which contain metal atoms with low coordination numbers-are more active
in catalysing oxidation and reduction of chemically active groups in
surface-anchored N-heterocyclic carbene molecules.

Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer.
Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which breast cell fate are regulated are largely
unknown. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal
epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells 
and more restricted progenitors. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium,
but the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast epithelial hierarchy remain
ill-defined. Here, we use a high-content confocal image-based short hairpin RNA
screen to identify tumour suppressors that regulate breast cell fate in primary
human breast epithelial cells. We show that ablation of the large tumour
suppressor kinases (LATS) 1 and 2 (refs 5, 6), which are part of the Hippo
pathway, promotes the luminal phenotype and increases the number of bipotent and 
luminal progenitors, the proposed cells-of-origin of most human breast cancers.
Mechanistically, we have identified a direct interaction between Hippo and
oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling. In the presence of LATS, ERα was targeted 
for ubiquitination and Ddb1-cullin4-associated-factor 1 (DCAF1)-dependent
proteasomal degradation. Absence of LATS stabilized ERα and the Hippo effectors
YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ), which together control breast cell fate through 
intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings reveal a non-canonical (that is,
YAP/TAZ-independent) effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate.

Breeding site sampling across the Arctic by individual males of a polygynous
shorebird.

Institute for Ornithology, Eberhard Gwinner Str, 82319 Seewiesen, Germany.

Males of many polygynous species compete for access to fertile females without
providing them with resources other than sperm and without investing in care for 
the offspring (male dominance polygyny). In such systems, local competition for
access to females is intense and typically only a few males obtain matings,
leading to strong sexual selection. Sampling multiple breeding areas could then
provide a mechanism for males to increase their chances to reproduce. However,
little is known about such sampling behaviour and about the spatial scale at
which males compete. Here we show that most males of a migratory, polygynous
shorebird, the pectoral sandpiper (Calidris melanotos), that arrived at a known
breeding location in northern Alaska subsequently moved through a considerable
part of the entire species' breeding range (up to 13,045 km in a four-week
period), sampling as many as 23 additional potential breeding sites. Our data
suggest that males do not have a final breeding destination after migration from 
their wintering quarters, but make nomadic movements that are probably not a
consequence of breeding failure. Tenure, the duration of stay at a site,
correlated strongly with the number of breeding females at the site, suggesting
that decisions to leave are dependent on local mating opportunities. Nomadic
movements may allow males to display and sire offspring at multiple sites within 
a single breeding season. Sexual selection may then favour high-performance males
that are able to reduce sleep to compete locally and to fly long distances
between breeding sites, leading to a population with unrestricted interbreeding
and without local adaptation and speciation.

The spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a central part in fundamental
physics over the past 200 years. Historical examples of its importance include
the wavelength measurements of absorption lines in the solar spectrum by
Fraunhofer, the identification of transition lines by Balmer, Lyman and others,
the empirical description of allowed wavelengths by Rydberg, the quantum model of
Bohr, the capability of quantum electrodynamics to precisely predict transition
frequencies, and modern measurements of the 1S-2S transition by Hänsch to a
precision of a few parts in 1015. Recent technological advances have allowed us
to focus on antihydrogen-the antimatter equivalent of hydrogen. The Standard
Model predicts that there should have been equal amounts of matter and antimatter
in the primordial Universe after the Big Bang, but today's Universe is observed
to consist almost entirely of ordinary matter. This motivates the study of
antimatter, to see if there is a small asymmetry in the laws of physics that
govern the two types of matter. In particular, the CPT (charge conjugation,
parity reversal and time reversal) theorem, a cornerstone of the Standard Model, 
requires that hydrogen and antihydrogen have the same spectrum. Here we report
the observation of the 1S-2S transition in magnetically trapped atoms of
antihydrogen. We determine that the frequency of the transition, which is driven 
by two photons from a laser at 243 nanometres, is consistent with that expected
for hydrogen in the same environment. This laser excitation of a quantum state of
an atom of antimatter represents the most precise measurement performed on an
anti-atom. Our result is consistent with CPT invariance at a relative precision
of about 2 × 10-10.

CLC proteins transport chloride (Cl-) ions across cellular membranes to regulate 
muscle excitability, electrolyte movement across epithelia, and acidification of 
intracellular organelles. Some CLC proteins are channels that conduct Cl- ions
passively, whereas others are secondary active transporters that exchange two Cl-
ions for one H+. The structural basis underlying these distinctive transport
mechanisms is puzzling because CLC channels and transporters are expected to
share the same architecture on the basis of sequence homology. Here we determined
the structure of a bovine CLC channel (CLC-K) using cryo-electron microscopy. A
conserved loop in the Cl- transport pathway shows a structure markedly different 
from that of CLC transporters. Consequently, the cytosolic constriction for Cl-
passage is widened in CLC-K such that the kinetic barrier previously postulated
for Cl-/H+ transporter function would be reduced. Thus, reduction of a kinetic
barrier in CLC channels enables fast flow of Cl- down its electrochemical
gradient.

In bacteria, ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNAs that lack a stop codon are
rescued by the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), alternative rescue factor A (ArfA)
or ArfB systems. Although tmRNA-ribosome and ArfB-ribosome structures have been
determined, how ArfA recognizes the presence of truncated mRNAs and recruits the 
canonical termination release factor RF2 to rescue the stalled ribosomes is
unclear. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the
Escherichia coli 70S ribosome stalled on a truncated mRNA in the presence of ArfA
and RF2. The structure shows that the C terminus of ArfA binds within the mRNA
entry channel on the small ribosomal subunit, and explains how ArfA distinguishes
between ribosomes that bear truncated or full-length mRNAs. The N terminus of
ArfA establishes several interactions with the decoding domain of RF2, and this
finding illustrates how ArfA recruits RF2 to the stalled ribosome. Furthermore,
ArfA is shown to stabilize a unique conformation of the switch loop of RF2, which
mimics the canonical translation termination state by directing the catalytically
important GGQ motif within domain 3 of RF2 towards the peptidyl-transferase
centre of the ribosome. Thus, our structure reveals not only how ArfA recruits
RF2 to the ribosome but also how it promotes an active conformation of RF2 to
enable translation termination in the absence of a stop codon.

During cellular translation of messenger RNAs by ribosomes, the translation
apparatus sometimes pauses or stalls at the elongation and termination steps.
With the exception of programmed stalling, which is usually used by cells for
regulatory purposes, ribosomes stalled on mRNAs need to be terminated and
recycled to maintain adequate translation capacity. Much ribosome stalling
originates in aberrant mRNAs that lack a stop codon. Transcriptional errors,
misprocessing of primary transcripts, and undesired mRNA cleavage all contribute 
to the formation of non-stop mRNAs. Ribosomes stalled at the 3' end of non-stop
mRNAs do not undergo normal termination owing to the lack of specific stop-codon 
recognition by canonical peptide release factors at the A-site decoding centre.
In bacteria, the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)-SmpB-mediated trans-translation
rescue system reroutes stalled ribosomes to the normal elongation cycle and
translation termination. Two additional rescue systems, ArfA-RF2 (refs 13, 14,
15, 16) and ArfB (formerly known as YaeJ), are also present in many bacterial
species, but their mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, using cryo-electron
microscopy, we characterize the structure of the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome
bound with ArfA, the release factor RF2, a short non-stop mRNA and a cognate
P-site tRNA. The C-terminal loop of ArfA occupies the mRNA entry channel on the
30S subunit, whereas its N terminus is sandwiched between the decoding centre and
the switch loop of RF2, leading to marked conformational changes in both the
decoding centre and RF2. Despite the distinct conformation of RF2, its conserved 
catalytic GGQ motif is precisely positioned next to the CCA-end of the P-site
tRNA. These data illustrate a stop-codon surrogate mechanism for ArfA in
facilitating the termination of non-stop ribosomal complexes by RF2.

Advanced photonic nanostructures are currently revolutionizing the optics and
photonics that underpin applications ranging from light technology to
quantum-information processing. The strong light confinement in these structures 
can lock the local polarization of the light to its propagation direction,
leading to propagation-direction-dependent emission, scattering and absorption of
photons by quantum emitters. The possibility of such a
propagation-direction-dependent, or chiral, light-matter interaction is not
accounted for in standard quantum optics and its recent discovery brought about
the research field of chiral quantum optics. The latter offers fundamentally new 
functionalities and applications: it enables the assembly of non-reciprocal
single-photon devices that can be operated in a quantum superposition of two or
more of their operational states and the realization of deterministic spin-photon
interfaces. Moreover, engineered directional photonic reservoirs could lead to
the development of complex quantum networks that, for example, could simulate
novel classes of quantum many-body systems.

Once considered provocative, the notion that the wisdom of the crowd is superior 
to any individual has become itself a piece of crowd wisdom, leading to
speculation that online voting may soon put credentialed experts out of business.
Recent applications include political and economic forecasting, evaluating
nuclear safety, public policy, the quality of chemical probes, and possible
responses to a restless volcano. Algorithms for extracting wisdom from the crowd 
are typically based on a democratic voting procedure. They are simple to apply
and preserve the independence of personal judgment. However, democratic methods
have serious limitations. They are biased for shallow, lowest common denominator 
information, at the expense of novel or specialized knowledge that is not widely 
shared. Adjustments based on measuring confidence do not solve this problem
reliably. Here we propose the following alternative to a democratic vote: select 
the answer that is more popular than people predict. We show that this principle 
yields the best answer under reasonable assumptions about voter behaviour, while 
the standard 'most popular' or 'most confident' principles fail under exactly
those same assumptions. Like traditional voting, the principle accepts unique
problems, such as panel decisions about scientific or artistic merit, and legal
or historical disputes. The potential application domain is thus broader than
that covered by machine learning and psychometric methods, which require data
across multiple questions.

The isotopic nature of the Earth's accreting material through time.

The Earth formed by accretion of Moon- to Mars-size embryos coming from various
heliocentric distances. The isotopic nature of these bodies is unknown. However, 
taking meteorites as a guide, most models assume that the Earth must have formed 
from a heterogeneous assortment of embryos with distinct isotopic compositions.
High-precision measurements, however, show that the Earth, the Moon and enstatite
meteorites have almost indistinguishable isotopic compositions. Models have been 
proposed that reconcile the Earth-Moon similarity with the inferred heterogeneous
nature of Earth-forming material, but these models either require specific
geometries for the Moon-forming impact or can explain only one aspect of the
Earth-Moon similarity (that is, 17O). Here I show that elements with distinct
affinities for metal can be used to decipher the isotopic nature of the Earth's
accreting material through time. I find that the mantle signatures of lithophile 
O, Ca, Ti and Nd, moderately siderophile Cr, Ni and Mo, and highly siderophile Ru
record different stages of the Earth's accretion; yet all those elements point to
material that was isotopically most similar to enstatite meteorites. This
isotopic similarity indicates that the material accreted by the Earth always
comprised a large fraction of enstatite-type impactors (about half were E-type in
the first 60 per cent of the accretion and all of the impactors were E-type after
that). Accordingly, the giant impactor that formed the Moon probably had an
isotopic composition similar to that of the Earth, hence relaxing the constraints
on models of lunar formation. Enstatite meteorites and the Earth were formed from
the same isotopic reservoir but they diverged in their chemical evolution owing
to subsequent fractionation by nebular and planetary processes.

Ruthenium isotopic evidence for an inner Solar System origin of the late veneer.

The excess of highly siderophile elements in the Earth's mantle is thought to
reflect the addition of primitive meteoritic material after core formation
ceased. This 'late veneer' either comprises material remaining in the terrestrial
planet region after the main stages of the Earth's accretion, or derives from
more distant asteroidal or cometary sources. Distinguishing between these
disparate origins is important because a late veneer consisting of carbonaceous
chondrite-like asteroids or comets could be the principal source of the Earth's
volatiles and water. Until now, however, a 'genetic' link between the late veneer
and such volatile-rich materials has not been established or ruled out. Such
genetic links can be determined using ruthenium (Ru) isotopes, because the Ru in 
the Earth's mantle predominantly derives from the late veneer, and because
meteorites exhibit Ru isotope variations arising from the heterogeneous
distribution of stellar-derived dust. Although Ru isotopic data and the
correlation of Ru and molybdenum (Mo) isotope anomalies in meteorites were
previously used to argue that the late veneer derives from the same type of inner
Solar System material as do Earth's main building blocks, the Ru isotopic
composition of carbonaceous chondrites has not been determined sufficiently well 
to rule them out as a source of the late veneer. Here we show that all
chondrites, including carbonaceous chondrites, have Ru isotopic compositions
distinct from that of the Earth's mantle. The Ru isotope anomalies increase from 
enstatite to ordinary to carbonaceous chondrites, demonstrating that material
formed at greater heliocentric distance contains larger Ru isotope anomalies.
Therefore, these data refute an outer Solar System origin for the late veneer and
imply that the late veneer was not the primary source of volatiles and water on
the Earth.

Picornaviruses are a leading cause of human and veterinary infections that result
in various diseases, including polio and the common cold. As archetypical
non-enveloped viruses, their biology has been extensively studied. Although a
range of different cell-surface receptors are bound by different picornaviruses, 
it is unclear whether common host factors are needed for them to reach the
cytoplasm. Using genome-wide haploid genetic screens, here we identify the
lipid-modifying enzyme PLA2G16 (refs 8, 9, 10, 11) as a picornavirus host factor 
that is required for a previously unknown event in the viral life cycle. We find 
that PLA2G16 functions early during infection, enabling virion-mediated genome
delivery into the cytoplasm, but not in any virion-assigned step, such as cell
binding, endosomal trafficking or pore formation. To resolve this paradox, we
screened for suppressors of the ΔPLA2G16 phenotype and identified a mechanism
previously implicated in the clearance of intracellular bacteria. The sensor of
this mechanism, galectin-8 (encoded by LGALS8), detects permeated endosomes and
marks them for autophagic degradation, whereas PLA2G16 facilitates viral genome
translocation and prevents clearance. This study uncovers two competing processes
triggered by virus entry: activation of a pore-activated clearance pathway and
recruitment of a phospholipase to enable genome release.

In the Drosophila optic lobes, 800 retinotopically organized columns in the
medulla act as functional units for processing visual information. The medulla
contains over 80 types of neuron, which belong to two classes: uni-columnar
neurons have a stoichiometry of one per column, while multi-columnar neurons
contact multiple columns. Here we show that combinatorial inputs from temporal
and spatial axes generate this neuronal diversity: all neuroblasts switch fates
over time to produce different neurons; the neuroepithelium that generates
neuroblasts is also subdivided into six compartments by the expression of
specific factors. Uni-columnar neurons are produced in all spatial compartments
independently of spatial input; they innervate the neuropil where they are
generated. Multi-columnar neurons are generated in smaller numbers in restricted 
compartments and require spatial input; the majority of their cell bodies
subsequently move to cover the entire medulla. The selective integration of
spatial inputs by a fixed temporal neuroblast cascade thus acts as a powerful
mechanism for generating neural diversity, regulating stoichiometry and the
formation of retinotopy.

As malignant tumours develop, they interact intimately with their
microenvironment and can activate autophagy, a catabolic process which provides
nutrients during starvation. How tumours regulate autophagy in vivo and whether
autophagy affects tumour growth is controversial. Here we demonstrate, using a
well characterized Drosophila melanogaster malignant tumour model, that
non-cell-autonomous autophagy is induced both in the tumour microenvironment and 
systemically in distant tissues. Tumour growth can be pharmacologically
restrained using autophagy inhibitors, and early-stage tumour growth and invasion
are genetically dependent on autophagy within the local tumour microenvironment. 
Induction of autophagy is mediated by Drosophila tumour necrosis factor and
interleukin-6-like signalling from metabolically stressed tumour cells, whereas
tumour growth depends on active amino acid transport. We show that dormant
growth-impaired tumours from autophagy-deficient animals reactivate tumorous
growth when transplanted into autophagy-proficient hosts. We conclude that
transformed cells engage surrounding normal cells as active and essential
microenvironmental contributors to early tumour growth through
nutrient-generating autophagy.

The origin and cellular complexity of eukaryotes represent a major enigma in
biology. Current data support scenarios in which an archaeal host cell and an
alphaproteobacterial (mitochondrial) endosymbiont merged together, resulting in
the first eukaryotic cell. The host cell is related to Lokiarchaeota, an archaeal
phylum with many eukaryotic features. The emergence of the structural complexity 
that characterizes eukaryotic cells remains unclear. Here we describe the
'Asgard' superphylum, a group of uncultivated archaea that, as well as
Lokiarchaeota, includes Thor-, Odin- and Heimdallarchaeota. Asgard archaea
affiliate with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses, and their genomes are
enriched for proteins formerly considered specific to eukaryotes. Notably,
thorarchaeal genomes encode several homologues of eukaryotic membrane-trafficking
machinery components, including Sec23/24 and TRAPP domains. Furthermore, we
identify thorarchaeal proteins with similar features to eukaryotic coat proteins 
involved in vesicle biogenesis. Our results expand the known repertoire of
'eukaryote-specific' proteins in Archaea, indicating that the archaeal host cell 
already contained many key components that govern eukaryotic cellular complexity.

The human large intestine is populated by a high density of microorganisms,
collectively termed the colonic microbiota, which has an important role in human 
health and nutrition. The survival of microbiota members from the dominant
Gram-negative phylum Bacteroidetes depends on their ability to degrade dietary
glycans that cannot be metabolized by the host. The genes encoding proteins
involved in the degradation of specific glycans are organized into co-regulated
polysaccharide utilization loci, with the archetypal locus sus (for starch
utilisation system) encoding seven proteins, SusA-SusG. Glycan degradation mainly
occurs intracellularly and depends on the import of oligosaccharides by an outer 
membrane protein complex composed of an extracellular SusD-like lipoprotein and
an integral membrane SusC-like TonB-dependent transporter. The presence of the
partner SusD-like lipoprotein is the major feature that distinguishes SusC-like
proteins from previously characterized TonB-dependent transporters. Many
sequenced gut Bacteroides spp. encode over 100 SusCD pairs, of which the majority
have unknown functions and substrate specificities. The mechanism by which
extracellular substrate binding by SusD proteins is coupled to outer membrane
passage through their cognate SusC transporter is unknown. Here we present X-ray 
crystal structures of two functionally distinct SusCD complexes purified from
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and derive a general model for substrate
translocation. The SusC transporters form homodimers, with each β-barrel protomer
tightly capped by SusD. Ligands are bound at the SusC-SusD interface in a large
solvent-excluded cavity. Molecular dynamics simulations and single-channel
electrophysiology reveal a 'pedal bin' mechanism, in which SusD moves away from
SusC in a hinge-like fashion in the absence of ligand to expose the
substrate-binding site to the extracellular milieu. These data provide
mechanistic insights into outer membrane nutrient import by members of the
microbiota, an area of major importance for understanding human-microbiota
symbiosis.

Hyoliths are abundant and globally distributed 'shelly' fossils that appear early
in the Cambrian period and can be found throughout the 280 million year span of
Palaeozoic strata. The ecological and evolutionary importance of this group has
remained unresolved, largely because of their poorly constrained soft anatomy and
idiosyncratic scleritome, which comprises an operculum, a conical shell and, in
some taxa, a pair of lateral spines (helens). Since their first description over 
175 years ago, hyoliths have most often been regarded as incertae sedis, related 
to molluscs or assigned to their own phylum. Here we examine over 1,500 specimens
of the mid-Cambrian hyolith Haplophrentis from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale
Lagerstätten. We reconstruct Haplophrentis as a semi-sessile, epibenthic
suspension feeder that could use its helens to elevate its tubular body above the
sea floor. Exceptionally preserved soft tissues include an extendable,
gullwing-shaped, tentacle-bearing organ surrounding a central mouth, which we
interpret as a lophophore, and a U-shaped digestive tract ending in a
dorsolateral anus. Together with opposing bilateral sclerites and a deep ventral 
visceral cavity, these features indicate an affinity with the lophophorates
(brachiopods, phoronids and tommotiids), substantially increasing the
morphological disparity of this prominent group.

Oligomerization of membrane proteins in response to lipid binding has a critical 
role in many cell-signalling pathways but is often difficult to define or
predict. Here we report the development of a mass spectrometry platform to
determine simultaneously the presence of interfacial lipids and oligomeric
stability and to uncover how lipids act as key regulators of membrane-protein
association. Evaluation of oligomeric strength for a dataset of 125 α-helical
oligomeric membrane proteins reveals an absence of interfacial lipids in the mass
spectra of 12 membrane proteins with high oligomeric stability. For the bacterial
homologue of the eukaryotic biogenic transporters (LeuT, one of the proteins with
the lowest oligomeric stability), we found a precise cohort of lipids within the 
dimer interface. Delipidation, mutation of lipid-binding sites or expression in
cardiolipin-deficient Escherichia coli abrogated dimer formation. Molecular
dynamics simulation revealed that cardiolipin acts as a bidentate ligand,
bridging across subunits. Subsequently, we show that for the Vibrio splendidus
sugar transporter SemiSWEET, another protein with low oligomeric stability,
cardiolipin shifts the equilibrium from monomer to functional dimer. We
hypothesized that lipids are essential for dimerization of the Na+/H+ antiporter 
NhaA from E. coli, which has the lowest oligomeric strength, but not for the
substantially more stable homologous Thermus thermophilus protein NapA. We found 
that lipid binding is obligatory for dimerization of NhaA, whereas NapA has
adapted to form an interface that is stable without lipids. Overall, by
correlating interfacial strength with the presence of interfacial lipids, we
provide a rationale for understanding the role of lipids in both transient and
stable interactions within a range of α-helical membrane proteins, including
G-protein-coupled receptors.

Prostate tumours are highly variable in their response to therapies, but
clinically available prognostic factors can explain only a fraction of this
heterogeneity. Here we analysed 200 whole-genome sequences and 277 additional
whole-exome sequences from localized, non-indolent prostate tumours with similar 
clinical risk profiles, and carried out RNA and methylation analyses in a subset.
These tumours had a paucity of clinically actionable single nucleotide variants, 
unlike those seen in metastatic disease. Rather, a significant proportion of
tumours harboured recurrent non-coding aberrations, large-scale genomic
rearrangements, and alterations in which an inversion repressed transcription
within its boundaries. Local hypermutation events were frequent, and correlated
with specific genomic profiles. Numerous molecular aberrations were prognostic
for disease recurrence, including several DNA methylation events, and a signature
comprised of these aberrations outperformed well-described prognostic biomarkers.
We suggest that intensified treatment of genomically aggressive localized
prostate cancer may improve cure rates.

Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing 
them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in 
order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an 
alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as
ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active
macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity
is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend
on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound
can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation).
Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only
available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails
selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, 
sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use 
of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization-a particularly
serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show
that dienes containing an E-alkenyl-B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic
cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow
them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is 
promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at 
a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the
utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic)
and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is
less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of
pacritinib-a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for
treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis-was prepared by RCM carried out at a
substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used.

Hurricane intensification along United States coast suppressed during active
hurricane periods.

Climate, 1225 W. Dayton Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.

The North Atlantic ocean/atmosphere environment exhibits pronounced interdecadal 
variability that is known to strongly modulate Atlantic hurricane activity.
Variability in sea surface temperature (SST) is correlated with hurricane
variability through its relationship with the genesis and thermodynamic potential
intensity of hurricanes. Another key factor that governs the genesis and
intensity of hurricanes is ambient environmental vertical wind shear (VWS).
Warmer SSTs generally correlate with more frequent genesis and greater potential 
intensity, while VWS inhibits genesis and prevents any hurricanes that do form
from reaching their potential intensity. When averaged over the main
hurricane-development region in the Atlantic, SST and VWS co-vary inversely, so
that the two factors act in concert to either enhance or inhibit basin-wide
hurricane activity. Here I show, however, that conditions conducive to greater
basin-wide Atlantic hurricane activity occur together with conditions for more
probable weakening of hurricanes near the United States coast. Thus, the VWS and 
SST form a protective barrier along the United States coast during periods of
heightened basin-wide hurricane activity. Conversely, during the most-recent
period of basin-wide quiescence, hurricanes (and particularly major hurricanes)
near the United States coast, although substantially less frequent, exhibited
much greater variability in their rate of intensification, and were much more
likely to intensify rapidly. Such heightened variability poses greater challenges
to operational forecasting and, consequently, greater coastal risk during
hurricane events.

Embryonic development is driven by tightly regulated patterns of gene expression,
despite extensive genetic variation among individuals. Studies of expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) indicate that genetic variation frequently alters 
gene expression in cell-culture models and differentiated tissues. However, the
extent and types of genetic variation impacting embryonic gene expression, and
their interactions with developmental programs, remain largely unknown. Here we
assessed the effect of genetic variation on transcriptional (expression levels)
and post-transcriptional (3' RNA processing) regulation across multiple stages of
metazoan development, using 80 inbred Drosophila wild isolates, identifying
thousands of developmental-stage-specific and shared QTL. Given the small blocks 
of linkage disequilibrium in Drosophila, we obtain near base-pair resolution,
resolving causal mutations in developmental enhancers, validated
transcription-factor-binding sites and RNA motifs. This fine-grain mapping
uncovered extensive allelic interactions within enhancers that have opposite
effects, thereby buffering their impact on enhancer activity. QTL affecting 3'
RNA processing identify new functional motifs leading to transcript isoform
diversity and changes in the lengths of 3' untranslated regions. These results
highlight how developmental stage influences the effects of genetic variation and
uncover multiple mechanisms that regulate and buffer expression variation during 
embryogenesis.

Internal bases in mRNA can be subjected to modifications that influence the fate 
of mRNA in cells. One of the most prevalent modified bases is found at the 5' end
of mRNA, at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the 7-methylguanosine cap.
Here we show that this nucleotide, N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), is a
reversible modification that influences cellular mRNA fate. Using a
transcriptome-wide map of m6Am we find that m6Am-initiated transcripts are
markedly more stable than mRNAs that begin with other nucleotides. We show that
the enhanced stability of m6Am-initiated transcripts is due to resistance to the 
mRNA-decapping enzyme DCP2. Moreover, we find that m6Am is selectively
demethylated by fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). FTO preferentially
demethylates m6Am rather than N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and reduces the stability
of m6Am mRNAs. Together, these findings show that the methylation status of m6Am 
in the 5' cap is a dynamic and reversible epitranscriptomic modification that
determines mRNA stability.

The macronutrient phosphorus is thought to limit primary productivity in the
oceans on geological timescales. Although there has been a sustained effort to
reconstruct the dynamics of the phosphorus cycle over the past 3.5 billion years,
it remains uncertain whether phosphorus limitation persisted throughout Earth's
history and therefore whether the phosphorus cycle has consistently modulated
biospheric productivity and ocean-atmosphere oxygen levels over time. Here we
present a compilation of phosphorus abundances in marine sedimentary rocks
spanning the past 3.5 billion years. We find evidence for relatively low
authigenic phosphorus burial in shallow marine environments until about 800 to
700 million years ago. Our interpretation of the database leads us to propose
that limited marginal phosphorus burial before that time was linked to phosphorus
biolimitation, resulting in elemental stoichiometries in primary producers that
diverged strongly from the Redfield ratio (the atomic ratio of carbon, nitrogen
and phosphorus found in phytoplankton). We place our phosphorus record in a
quantitative biogeochemical model framework and find that a combination of
enhanced phosphorus scavenging in anoxic, iron-rich oceans and a nutrient-based
bistability in atmospheric oxygen levels could have resulted in a stable
low-oxygen world. The combination of these factors may explain the protracted
oxygenation of Earth's surface over the last 3.5 billion years of Earth history. 
However, our analysis also suggests that a fundamental shift in the phosphorus
cycle may have occurred during the late Proterozoic eon (between 800 and 635
million years ago), coincident with a previously inferred shift in marine redox
states, severe perturbations to Earth's climate system, and the emergence of
animals.

A long-term aim of the life sciences is to understand how organismal shape is
encoded by the genome. An important challenge is to identify mechanistic links
between the genes that control cell-fate decisions and the cellular machines that
generate shape, therefore closing the gap between genotype and phenotype. The
logic and mechanisms that integrate these different levels of shape control are
beginning to be described, and recently discovered mechanisms of cross-talk and
feedback are beginning to explain the remarkable robustness of organ assembly.
The 'full-circle' understanding of morphogenesis that is emerging, besides
solving a key puzzle in biology, provides a mechanistic framework for future
approaches to tissue engineering.

Self-organized regular vegetation patterns are widespread and thought to mediate 
ecosystem functions such as productivity and robustness, but the mechanisms
underlying their origin and maintenance remain disputed. Particularly
controversial are landscapes of overdispersed (evenly spaced) elements, such as
North American Mima mounds, Brazilian murundus, South African heuweltjies, and,
famously, Namibian fairy circles. Two competing hypotheses are currently debated.
On the one hand, models of scale-dependent feedbacks, whereby plants facilitate
neighbours while competing with distant individuals, can reproduce various
regular patterns identified in satellite imagery. Owing to deep theoretical roots
and apparent generality, scale-dependent feedbacks are widely viewed as a
unifying and near-universal principle of regular-pattern formation despite scant 
empirical evidence. On the other hand, many overdispersed vegetation patterns
worldwide have been attributed to subterranean ecosystem engineers such as
termites, ants, and rodents. Although potentially consistent with territorial
competition, this interpretation has been challenged theoretically and
empirically and (unlike scale-dependent feedbacks) lacks a unifying dynamical
theory, fuelling scepticism about its plausibility and generality. Here we
provide a general theoretical foundation for self-organization of social-insect
colonies, validated using data from four continents, which demonstrates that
intraspecific competition between territorial animals can generate the
large-scale hexagonal regularity of these patterns. However, this mechanism is
not mutually exclusive with scale-dependent feedbacks. Using Namib Desert fairy
circles as a case study, we present field data showing that these landscapes
exhibit multi-scale patterning-previously undocumented in this system-that cannot
be explained by either mechanism in isolation. These multi-scale patterns and
other emergent properties, such as enhanced resistance to and recovery from
drought, instead arise from dynamic interactions in our theoretical framework,
which couples both mechanisms. The potentially global extent of animal-induced
regularity in vegetation-which can modulate other patterning processes in
functionally important ways-emphasizes the need to integrate multiple mechanisms 
of ecological self-organization.

A growing number of nucleobase modifications in messenger RNA have been revealed 
through advances in detection and RNA sequencing. Although some of the
biochemical pathways that involve modified bases have been identified, research
into the world of RNA modification - the epitranscriptome - is still in an early 
phase. A variety of chemical tools are being used to characterize base
modifications, and the structural effects of known base modifications on RNA
pairing, thermodynamics and folding are being determined in relation to their
putative biological roles.

Three of the most fundamental questions in biology are how individual cells
differentiate to form tissues, how tissues function in a coordinated and flexible
fashion and which gene regulatory mechanisms support these processes. Single-cell
genomics is opening up new ways to tackle these questions by combining the
comprehensive nature of genomics with the microscopic resolution that is required
to describe complex multicellular systems. Initial single-cell genomic studies
provided a remarkably rich phenomenology of heterogeneous cellular states, but
transforming observational studies into models of dynamics and causal mechanisms 
in tissues poses fresh challenges and requires stronger integration of
theoretical, computational and experimental frameworks.

Elements of cancer immunity and the cancer-immune set point.

Immunotherapy is proving to be an effective therapeutic approach in a variety of 
cancers. But despite the clinical success of antibodies against the immune
regulators CTLA4 and PD-L1/PD-1, only a subset of people exhibit durable
responses, suggesting that a broader view of cancer immunity is required.
Immunity is influenced by a complex set of tumour, host and environmental factors
that govern the strength and timing of the anticancer response. Clinical studies 
are beginning to define these factors as immune profiles that can predict
responses to immunotherapy. In the context of the cancer-immunity cycle, such
factors combine to represent the inherent immunological status - or
'cancer-immune set point' - of an individual.

Advances in fabrication technologies are enabling the production of architected
materials with unprecedented properties. Most such materials are characterized by
a fixed geometry, but in the design of some materials it is possible to
incorporate internal mechanisms capable of reconfiguring their spatial
architecture, and in this way to enable tunable functionality. Inspired by the
structural diversity and foldability of the prismatic geometries that can be
constructed using the snapology origami technique, here we introduce a robust
design strategy based on space-filling tessellations of polyhedra to create
three-dimensional reconfigurable materials comprising a periodic assembly of
rigid plates and elastic hinges. Guided by numerical analysis and physical
prototypes, we systematically explore the mobility of the designed structures and
identify a wide range of qualitatively different deformations and internal
rearrangements. Given that the underlying principles are scale-independent, our
strategy can be applied to the design of the next generation of reconfigurable
structures and materials, ranging from metre-scale transformable architectures to
nanometre-scale tunable photonic systems.

Advances in the sequencing and the analysis of the genomes of both modern and
ancient peoples have facilitated a number of breakthroughs in our understanding
of human evolutionary history. These include the discovery of interbreeding
between anatomically modern humans and extinct hominins; the development of an
increasingly detailed description of the complex dispersal of modern humans out
of Africa and their population expansion worldwide; and the characterization of
many of the genetic adaptions of humans to local environmental conditions. Our
interpretation of the evolutionary history and adaptation of humans is being
transformed by analyses of these new genomic data.

Squeezed states of electromagnetic radiation have quantum fluctuations below
those of the vacuum field. They offer a unique resource for quantum information
systems and precision metrology, including gravitational wave detectors, which
require unprecedented sensitivity. Since the first experiments on this
non-classical form of light, quantum analysis has been based on homodyning
techniques and photon correlation measurements. These methods currently function 
in the visible to near-infrared and microwave spectral ranges. They require a
well-defined carrier frequency, and photons contained in a quantum state need to 
be absorbed or amplified. Quantum non-demolition experiments may be performed to 
avoid the influence of a measurement in one quadrature, but this procedure comes 
at the expense of increased uncertainty in another quadrature. Here we generate
mid-infrared time-locked patterns of squeezed vacuum noise. After propagation
through free space, the quantum fluctuations of the electric field are studied in
the time domain using electro-optic sampling with few-femtosecond laser pulses.
We directly compare the local noise amplitude to that of bare (that is,
unperturbed) vacuum. Our nonlinear approach operates off resonance and, unlike
homodyning or photon correlation techniques, without absorption or amplification 
of the field that is investigated. We find subcycle intervals with noise levels
that are substantially less than the amplitude of the vacuum field. As a
consequence, there are enhanced fluctuations in adjacent time intervals, owing to
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which indicate generation of highly
correlated quantum radiation. Together with efforts in the far infrared, this
work enables the study of elementary quantum dynamics of light and matter in an
energy range at the boundary between vacuum and thermal background conditions.

Oesophageal cancers are prominent worldwide; however, there are few targeted
therapies and survival rates for these cancers remain dismal. Here we performed a
comprehensive molecular analysis of 164 carcinomas of the oesophagus derived from
Western and Eastern populations. Beyond known histopathological and epidemiologic
distinctions, molecular features differentiated oesophageal squamous cell
carcinomas from oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas
resembled squamous carcinomas of other organs more than they did oesophageal
adenocarcinomas. Our analyses identified three molecular subclasses of
oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but none showed evidence for an
aetiological role of human papillomavirus. Squamous cell carcinomas showed
frequent genomic amplifications of CCND1 and SOX2 and/or TP63, whereas ERBB2,
VEGFA and GATA4 and GATA6 were more commonly amplified in adenocarcinomas.
Oesophageal adenocarcinomas strongly resembled the chromosomally unstable variant
of gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that these cancers could be considered a
single disease entity. However, some molecular features, including DNA
hypermethylation, occurred disproportionally in oesophageal adenocarcinomas.
These data provide a framework to facilitate more rational categorization of
these tumours and a foundation for new therapies.

Structural variation in amyloid-β fibrils from Alzheimer's disease clinical
subtypes.

Aggregation of amyloid-β peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is 
central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Fibrils formed in vitro by
40- and 42-residue amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) are polymorphic, with
variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions. Recent
experiments suggest that variations in amyloid-β fibril structure in vivo may
correlate with variations in Alzheimer's disease phenotype, in analogy to
distinct prion strains that are associated with different clinical and
pathological phenotypes. Here we investigate correlations between structural
variation and Alzheimer's disease phenotype using solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Aβ40 and Aβ42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth
from extracts of Alzheimer's disease brain cortex. We compared two atypical
Alzheimer's disease clinical subtypes-the rapidly progressive form (r-AD) and the
posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD)-with a typical prolonged-duration
form (t-AD). On the basis of ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18
individuals, we find that a single Aβ40 fibril structure is most abundant in
samples from patients with t-AD and PCA-AD, whereas Aβ40 fibrils from r-AD
samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data
for Aβ42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all
patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results
demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Aβ40 fibril structure in t-AD
and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures and
indicate that there is a qualitative difference between Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregates 
in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Despite the global prevalence of gastric disease, there are few adequate models
in which to study the fundus epithelium of the human stomach. We differentiated
human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into gastric organoids containing fundic
epithelium by first identifying and then recapitulating key events in embryonic
fundus development. We found that disruption of Wnt/β-catenin signalling in mouse
embryos led to conversion of fundic to antral epithelium, and that β-catenin
activation in hPSC-derived foregut progenitors promoted the development of human 
fundic-type gastric organoids (hFGOs). We then used hFGOs to identify temporally 
distinct roles for multiple signalling pathways in epithelial morphogenesis and
differentiation of fundic cell types, including chief cells and functional
parietal cells. hFGOs are a powerful model for studying the development of the
human fundus and the molecular bases of human gastric physiology and
pathophysiology, and also represent a new platform for drug discovery.

Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. This multi-stage
process requires tumour cells to survive in the circulation, extravasate at
distant sites, then proliferate; it involves contributions from both the tumour
cell and tumour microenvironment ('host', which includes stromal cells and the
immune system). Studies suggest the early steps of the metastatic process are
relatively efficient, with the post-extravasation regulation of tumour growth
('colonization') being critical in determining metastatic outcome. Here we show
the results of screening 810 mutant mouse lines using an in vivo assay to
identify microenvironmental regulators of metastatic colonization. We identify 23
genes that, when disrupted in mouse, modify the ability of tumour cells to
establish metastatic foci, with 19 of these genes not previously demonstrated to 
play a role in host control of metastasis. The largest reduction in pulmonary
metastasis was observed in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter spinster
homologue 2 (Spns2)-deficient mice. We demonstrate a novel outcome of
S1P-mediated regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, whereby deletion of Spns2,
either globally or in a lymphatic endothelial-specific manner, creates a
circulating lymphopenia and a higher percentage of effector T cells and natural
killer (NK) cells present in the lung. This allows for potent tumour cell
killing, and an overall decreased metastatic burden.

Penitentes are snow and ice features formed by erosion that, on Earth, are
characterized by bowl-shaped depressions several tens of centimetres across,
whose edges grade into spires up to several metres tall. Penitentes have been
suggested as an explanation for anomalous radar data on Europa, but until now no 
penitentes have been identified conclusively on planetary bodies other than
Earth. Regular ridges with spacings of 3,000 to 5,000 metres and depths of about 
500 metres with morphologies that resemble penitentes have been observed by the
New Horizons spacecraft in the Tartarus Dorsa region of Pluto (220°-250° E,
0°-20° N). Here we report simulations, based upon a recent model representing
conditions on Pluto, in which deepening penitentes reproduce both the tri-modal
(north-south, east-west and northeast-southwest) orientation and the spacing of
the ridges of this bladed terrain. At present, these penitentes deepen by
approximately one centimetre per orbital cycle and grow only during periods of
relatively high atmospheric pressure, suggesting a formation timescale of several
tens of millions of years, consistent with crater ages. This timescale implies
that the penitentes formed from initial topographic variations of no more than a 
few tens of metres, consistent with Pluto's youngest terrains.

Chimaeroid fishes (Holocephali) are one of the four principal divisions of modern
gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Despite only 47 described living species,
chimaeroids are the focus of resurgent interest as potential archives of genomic 
data and for the unique perspective they provide on chondrichthyan and
gnathostome ancestral conditions. Chimaeroids are also noteworthy for their
highly derived body plan. However, like other living groups with distinctive
anatomies, fossils have been of limited use in unravelling their evolutionary
origin, as the earliest recognized examples already exhibit many of the
specializations present in modern forms. Here we report the results of a computed
tomography analysis of Dwykaselachus, an enigmatic chondrichthyan braincase from 
the ~280 million year old Karoo sediments of South Africa. Externally, the
braincase is that of a symmoriid shark and is by far the most complete uncrushed 
example yet discovered. Internally, the morphology exhibits otherwise
characteristically chimaeroid specializations, including the otic labyrinth
arrangement and the brain space configuration relative to exceptionally large
orbits. These results have important implications for our view of modern
chondrichthyan origins, add robust structure to the phylogeny of early crown
group gnathostomes, reveal preconditions that suggest an initial
morpho-functional basis for the derived chimaeroid cranium, and shed new light on
the chondrichthyan response to the extinction at the end of the Devonian period.

Ash trees (genus Fraxinus, family Oleaceae) are widespread throughout the
Northern Hemisphere, but are being devastated in Europe by the fungus
Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, causing ash dieback, and in North America by the
herbivorous beetle Agrilus planipennis. Here we sequence the genome of a
low-heterozygosity Fraxinus excelsior tree from Gloucestershire, UK, annotating
38,852 protein-coding genes of which 25% appear ash specific when compared with
the genomes of ten other plant species. Analyses of paralogous genes suggest a
whole-genome duplication shared with olive (Olea europaea, Oleaceae). We also
re-sequence 37 F. excelsior trees from Europe, finding evidence for apparent
long-term decline in effective population size. Using our reference sequence, we 
re-analyse association transcriptomic data, yielding improved markers for reduced
susceptibility to ash dieback. Surveys of these markers in British populations
suggest that reduced susceptibility to ash dieback may be more widespread in
Great Britain than in Denmark. We also present evidence that susceptibility of
trees to H. fraxineus is associated with their iridoid glycoside levels. This
rapid, integrated, multidisciplinary research response to an emerging health
threat in a non-model organism opens the way for mitigation of the epidemic.

Chromatin structure at the length scale encompassing local nucleosome-nucleosome 
interactions is thought to play a crucial role in regulating transcription and
access to DNA. However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly
understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the
tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first
genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1-3 nucleosome
(50-500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated
cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA-DNA contacts that are 
spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional
enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent
nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked
heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome-nucleosome 
contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed
chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional
distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked
alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from 
H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures
are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin
architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal
compaction of two-start helical fibres.

Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts by
definition, recent studies have shown that a fraction of putative small open
reading frames within lncRNAs are translated. However, the biological
significance of these hidden polypeptides is still unclear. Here we identify and 
functionally characterize a novel polypeptide encoded by the lncRNA LINC00961.
This polypeptide is conserved between human and mouse, is localized to the late
endosome/lysosome and interacts with the lysosomal v-ATPase to negatively
regulate mTORC1 activation. This regulation of mTORC1 is specific to activation
of mTORC1 by amino acid stimulation, rather than by growth factors. Hence, we
termed this polypeptide 'small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response'
(SPAR). We show that the SPAR-encoding lncRNA is highly expressed in a subset of 
tissues and use CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to develop a SPAR-polypeptide-specific
knockout mouse while maintaining expression of the host lncRNA. We find that the 
SPAR-encoding lncRNA is downregulated in skeletal muscle upon acute injury, and
using this in vivo model we establish that SPAR downregulation enables efficient 
activation of mTORC1 and promotes muscle regeneration. Our data provide a
mechanism by which mTORC1 activation may be finely regulated in a tissue-specific
manner in response to injury, and a paradigm by which lncRNAs encoding small
polypeptides can modulate general biological pathways and processes to facilitate
tissue-specific requirements, consistent with their restricted and highly
regulated expression profile.

Respiratory dysfunction is a notorious cause of perinatal mortality in infants
and sleep apnoea in adults, but the mechanisms of respiratory control are not
clearly understood. Mechanical signals transduced by airway-innervating sensory
neurons control respiration; however, the physiological significance and
molecular mechanisms of these signals remain obscured. Here we show that global
and sensory neuron-specific ablation of the mechanically activated ion channel
Piezo2 causes respiratory distress and death in newborn mice. Optogenetic
activation of Piezo2+ vagal sensory neurons causes apnoea in adult mice.
Moreover, induced ablation of Piezo2 in sensory neurons of adult mice causes
decreased neuronal responses to lung inflation, an impaired Hering-Breuer
mechanoreflex, and increased tidal volume under normal conditions. These
phenotypes are reproduced in mice lacking Piezo2 in the nodose ganglion. Our data
suggest that Piezo2 is an airway stretch sensor and that Piezo2-mediated
mechanotransduction within various airway-innervating sensory neurons is critical
for establishing efficient respiration at birth and maintaining normal breathing 
in adults.

Aromatic and antiaromatic ring currents in a molecular nanoring.

Oxford OX1 3TA, UK.

Aromatic and antiaromatic molecules-which have delocalized circuits of [4n + 2]
or [4n] electrons, respectively-exhibit ring currents around their perimeters.
The direction of the ring current in an aromatic molecule is such as to generate 
a magnetic field that opposes the external field inside the ring (a 'diatropic'
current), while the ring current in an antiaromatic molecule flows in the reverse
direction ('paratropic'). Similar persistent currents occur in metal or
semiconductor rings, when the phase coherence of the electronic wavefunction is
preserved around the ring. Persistent currents in non-molecular rings switch
direction as a function of the magnetic flux passing through the ring, so that
they can be changed from diatropic ('aromatic') to paratropic ('antiaromatic')
simply by changing the external magnetic field. As in molecular systems, the
direction of the persistent current also depends on the number of electrons. The 
relationship between ring currents in molecular and non-molecular rings is poorly
understood, partly because they are studied in different size regimes: the
largest aromatic molecules have diameters of about one nanometre, whereas
persistent currents are observed in microfabricated rings with diameters of
20-1,000 nanometres. Understanding the connection between aromaticity and
quantum-coherence effects in mesoscopic rings provides a motivation for
investigating ring currents in molecules of an intermediate size. Here we show,
using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory, that
a six-porphyrin nanoring template complex, with a diameter of 2.4 nanometres, is 
antiaromatic in its 4+ oxidation state (80 π electrons) and aromatic in its 6+
oxidation state (78 π electrons). The antiaromatic state has a huge paramagnetic 
susceptibility, despite having no unpaired electrons. This work demonstrates that
a global ring current can be promoted in a macrocycle by adjusting its oxidation 
state to suppress the local ring currents of its components.The discovery of ring
currents around a molecule with a circumference of 7.5 nanometres, at room
temperature, shows that quantum coherence can persist in surprisingly large
molecular frameworks.

Riboswitches are structural RNA elements that are generally located in the 5'
untranslated region of messenger RNA. During regulation of gene expression,
ligand binding to the aptamer domain of a riboswitch triggers a signal to the
downstream expression platform. A complete understanding of the structural basis 
of this mechanism requires the ability to study structural changes over time.
Here we use femtosecond X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses to obtain
structural measurements from crystals so small that diffusion of a ligand can be 
timed to initiate a reaction before diffraction. We demonstrate this approach by 
determining four structures of the adenine riboswitch aptamer domain during the
course of a reaction, involving two unbound apo structures, one ligand-bound
intermediate, and the final ligand-bound conformation. These structures support a
reaction mechanism model with at least four states and illustrate the structural 
basis of signal transmission. The three-way junction and the P1 switch helix of
the two apo conformers are notably different from those in the ligand-bound
conformation. Our time-resolved crystallographic measurements with a 10-second
delay captured the structure of an intermediate with changes in the binding
pocket that accommodate the ligand. With at least a 10-minute delay, the RNA
molecules were fully converted to the ligand-bound state, in which the
substantial conformational changes resulted in conversion of the space group.
Such notable changes in crystallo highlight the important opportunities that
micro- and nanocrystals may offer in these and similar time-resolved diffraction 
studies. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of 'mix-and-inject'
time-resolved serial crystallography to study biochemically important
interactions between biomacromolecules and ligands, including those that involve 
large conformational changes.

The adult mammalian heart is incapable of regeneration following cardiomyocyte
loss, which underpins the lasting and severe effects of cardiomyopathy. Recently,
it has become clear that the mammalian heart is not a post-mitotic organ. For
example, the neonatal heart is capable of regenerating lost myocardium, and the
adult heart is capable of modest self-renewal. In both of these scenarios,
cardiomyocyte renewal occurs via the proliferation of pre-existing
cardiomyocytes, and is regulated by aerobic-respiration-mediated oxidative DNA
damage. Therefore, we reasoned that inhibiting aerobic respiration by inducing
systemic hypoxaemia would alleviate oxidative DNA damage, thereby inducing
cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult mammals. Here we report that, in mice,
gradual exposure to severe systemic hypoxaemia, in which inspired oxygen is
gradually decreased by 1% and maintained at 7% for 2 weeks, results in inhibition
of oxidative metabolism, decreased reactive oxygen species production and
oxidative DNA damage, and reactivation of cardiomyocyte mitosis. Notably, we find
that exposure to hypoxaemia 1 week after induction of myocardial infarction
induces a robust regenerative response with decreased myocardial fibrosis and
improvement of left ventricular systolic function. Genetic fate-mapping analysis 
confirms that the newly formed myocardium is derived from pre-existing
cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that the endogenous regenerative
properties of the adult mammalian heart can be reactivated by exposure to gradual
systemic hypoxaemia, and highlight the potential therapeutic role of hypoxia in
regenerative medicine.

Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum produce measurable physical
effects such as Casimir forces and the Lamb shift. They also impose an observable
limit-known as the quantum backaction limit-on the lowest temperatures that can
be reached using conventional laser cooling techniques. As laser cooling
experiments continue to bring massive mechanical systems to unprecedentedly low
temperatures, this seemingly fundamental limit is increasingly important in the
laboratory. Fortunately, vacuum fluctuations are not immutable and can be
'squeezed', reducing amplitude fluctuations at the expense of phase fluctuations.
Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate that squeezed light can be used to
cool the motion of a macroscopic mechanical object below the quantum backaction
limit. We first cool a microwave cavity optomechanical system using a coherent
state of light to within 15 per cent of this limit. We then cool the system to
more than two decibels below the quantum backaction limit using a squeezed
microwave field generated by a Josephson parametric amplifier. From heterodyne
spectroscopy of the mechanical sidebands, we measure a minimum thermal occupancy 
of 0.19 ± 0.01 phonons. With our technique, even low-frequency mechanical
oscillators can in principle be cooled arbitrarily close to the motional ground
state, enabling the exploration of quantum physics in larger, more massive
systems.

Reconstructing the history of tropical hydroclimates has been difficult,
particularly for the Amazon basin-one of Earth's major centres of deep
atmospheric convection. For example, whether the Amazon basin was substantially
drier or remained wet during glacial times has been controversial, largely
because most study sites have been located on the periphery of the basin, and
because interpretations can be complicated by sediment preservation,
uncertainties in chronology, and topographical setting. Here we show that
rainfall in the basin responds closely to changes in glacial boundary conditions 
in terms of temperature and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. Our
results are based on a decadally resolved, uranium/thorium-dated, oxygen isotopic
record for much of the past 45,000 years, obtained using speleothems from Paraíso
Cave in eastern Amazonia; we interpret the record as being broadly related to
precipitation. Relative to modern levels, precipitation in the region was about
58% during the Last Glacial Maximum (around 21,000 years ago) and 142% during the
mid-Holocene epoch (about 6,000 years ago). We find that, as compared with cave
records from the western edge of the lowlands, the Amazon was widely drier during
the last glacial period, with much less recycling of water and probably reduced
plant transpiration, although the rainforest persisted throughout this time.

In 1929, only three years after the advent of quantum mechanics, von Neumann and 
Wigner showed that Schrödinger's equation can have bound states above the
continuum threshold. These peculiar states, called bound states in the continuum 
(BICs), manifest themselves as resonances that do not decay. For several decades 
afterwards the idea lay dormant, regarded primarily as a mathematical curiosity. 
In 1977, Herrick and Stillinger revived interest in BICs when they suggested that
BICs could be observed in semiconductor superlattices. BICs arise naturally from 
Feshbach's quantum mechanical theory of resonances, as explained by Friedrich and
Wintgen, and are thus more physical than initially realized. Recently, it was
realized that BICs are intrinsically a wave phenomenon and are thus not
restricted to the realm of quantum mechanics. They have since been shown to occur
in many different fields of wave physics including acoustics, microwaves and
nanophotonics. However, experimental observations of BICs have been limited to
passive systems and the realization of BIC lasers has remained elusive. Here we
report, at room temperature, lasing action from an optically pumped BIC cavity.
Our results show that the lasing wavelength of the fabricated BIC cavities, each 
made of an array of cylindrical nanoresonators suspended in air, scales with the 
radii of the nanoresonators according to the theoretical prediction for the BIC
mode. Moreover, lasing action from the designed BIC cavity persists even after
scaling down the array to as few as 8-by-8 nanoresonators. BIC lasers open up new
avenues in the study of light-matter interaction because they are intrinsically
connected to topological charges and represent natural vector beam sources (that 
is, there are several possible beam shapes), which are highly sought after in the
fields of optical trapping, biological sensing and quantum information.

Phosphorus is an important nutrient for crop productivity. More than 60% of the
total phosphorus in cereal crops is finally allocated into the grains and is
therefore removed at harvest. This removal accounts for 85% of the phosphorus
fertilizers applied to the field each year. However, because humans and
non-ruminants such as poultry, swine and fish cannot digest phytate, the major
form of phosphorus in the grains, the excreted phosphorus causes eutrophication
of waterways. A reduction in phosphorus accumulation in the grain would
contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture. Here we
describe a rice transporter, SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter
(SPDT), that controls the allocation of phosphorus to the grain. SPDT is
expressed in the xylem region of both enlarged- and diffuse-vascular bundles of
the nodes, and encodes a plasma-membrane-localized transporter for phosphorus.
Knockout of this gene in rice (Oryza sativa) altered the distribution of
phosphorus, with decreased phosphorus in the grains but increased levels in the
leaves. Total phosphorus and phytate in the brown de-husked rice were 20-30%
lower in the knockout lines, whereas yield, seed germination and seedling vigour 
were not affected. These results indicate that SPDT functions in the rice node as
a switch to allocate phosphorus preferentially to the grains. This finding
provides a potential strategy to reduce the removal of phosphorus from the field 
and lower the risk of eutrophication of waterways.

Monocytes and macrophages comprise a variety of subsets with diverse functions.
It is thought that these cells play a crucial role in homeostasis of peripheral
organs, key immunological processes and development of various diseases. Among
these diseases, fibrosis is a life-threatening disease of unknown aetiology. Its 
pathogenesis is poorly understood, and there are few effective therapies. The
development of fibrosis is associated with activation of monocytes and
macrophages. However, the specific subtypes of monocytes and macrophages that are
involved in fibrosis have not yet been identified. Here we show that
Ceacam1+Msr1+Ly6C-F4/80-Mac1+ monocytes, which we term
segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocytes (SatM), share granulocyte
characteristics, are regulated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and 
are critical for fibrosis. Cebpb deficiency results in a complete lack of SatM.
Furthermore, the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, but not inflammation,
was prevented in chimaeric mice with Cebpb-/- haematopoietic cells. Adoptive
transfer of SatM into Cebpb-/- mice resulted in fibrosis. Notably, SatM are
derived from Ly6C-FcεRI+ granulocyte/macrophage progenitors, and a newly
identified SatM progenitor downstream of Ly6C-FcεRI+ granulocyte/macrophage
progenitors, but not from macrophage/dendritic-cell progenitors. Our results show
that SatM are critical for fibrosis and that C/EBPβ licenses differentiation of
SatM from their committed progenitor.

Comment in
    Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2017 Mar;13(3):127.

Approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide are overweight or affected by obesity,
and are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and related
metabolic and inflammatory disturbances. Although the mechanisms linking
adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies
suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation, a key regulator of gene
expression and molecular phenotype. Here we use epigenome-wide association to
show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with
widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P < 1 × 10-7, range 
P = 9.2 × 10-8 to 6.0 × 10-46; n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses 
demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the
consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci
are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P < 0.05), and 
show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 
loci (P < 9.0 × 10-6, range P = 5.5 × 10-6 to 6.1 × 10-35, n = 1,785 samples).
The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism,
substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the
disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes
(relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3
(2.07-2.56); P = 1.1 × 10-54). Our results provide new insights into the biologic
pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies
for prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes and other adverse clinical
consequences of obesity.

XRCC1 is a molecular scaffold protein that assembles multi-protein complexes
involved in DNA single-strand break repair. Here we show that biallelic mutations
in the human XRCC1 gene are associated with ocular motor apraxia, axonal
neuropathy, and progressive cerebellar ataxia. Cells from a patient with
mutations in XRCC1 exhibited not only reduced rates of single-strand break repair
but also elevated levels of protein ADP-ribosylation. This latter phenotype is
recapitulated in a related syndrome caused by mutations in the XRCC1 partner
protein PNKP and implicates hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase/s as a
cause of cerebellar ataxia. Indeed, remarkably, genetic deletion of Parp1 rescued
normal cerebellar ADP-ribose levels and reduced the loss of cerebellar neurons
and ataxia in Xrcc1-defective mice, identifying a molecular mechanism by which
endogenous single-strand breaks trigger neuropathology. Collectively, these data 
establish the importance of XRCC1 protein complexes for normal neurological
function and identify PARP1 as a therapeutic target in DNA strand break
repair-defective disease.

The heterotrimeric influenza polymerase (FluPol), comprising subunits PA, PB1 and
PB2, binds to the conserved 5' and 3' termini (the 'promoter') of each of the
eight single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments and performs both
transcription and replication of vRNA in the infected cell nucleus. To transcribe
viral mRNAs, FluPol associates with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which
enables it to take 5'-capped primers from nascent Pol II transcripts. Here we
present a co-crystal structure of bat influenza A polymerase bound to a Pol II
C-terminal domain (CTD) peptide mimic, which shows two distinct phosphoserine-5
(SeP5)-binding sites in the polymerase PA subunit, accommodating four CTD heptad 
repeats overall. Mutagenesis of the SeP5-contacting basic residues (PA K289,
R454, K635 and R638) weakens CTD repeat binding in vitro without affecting the
intrinsic cap-primed (transcription) or unprimed (replication) RNA synthesis
activity of recombinant polymerase, whereas in cell-based minigenome assays the
same mutations substantially reduce overall polymerase activity. Only recombinant
viruses with a single mutation in one of the SeP5-binding sites can be rescued,
but these viruses are severely attenuated and genetically unstable. Several
previously described mutants that modulate virulence can be rationalized by our
results, including a second site mutation (PA(C453R)) that enables the highly
attenuated mutant virus (PA(R638A)) to revert to near wild-type infectivity. We
conclude that direct binding of FluPol to the SeP5 Pol II CTD is fine-tuned to
allow efficient viral transcription and propose that the CTD-binding site on
FluPol could be targeted for antiviral drug development.

Packaging of the genome into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a 
host cell are two fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike
double-stranded DNA viruses, which pump their genome into a preformed capsid,
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble their
capsid with the genome; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly is
poorly understood. MS2 infects Escherichia coli via the host 'sex pilus'
(F-pilus); it was the first fully sequenced organism and is a model system for
studies of translational gene regulation, RNA-protein interactions, and RNA virus
assembly. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3,569 bases is enclosed in a capsid 
with one maturation protein monomer and 89 coat protein dimers arranged in a
T = 3 icosahedral lattice. The maturation protein is responsible for attaching
the virus to an F-pilus and delivering the viral genome into the host during
infection, but how the genome is organized and delivered is not known. Here we
describe the MS2 structure at 3.6 Å resolution, determined by electron-counting
cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction. We traced
approximately 80% of the backbone of the viral genome, built atomic models for 16
RNA stem-loops, and identified three conserved motifs of RNA-coat protein
interactions among 15 of these stem-loops with diverse sequences. The stem-loop
at the 3' end of the genome interacts extensively with the maturation protein,
which, with just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded β-sheet, forms a
genome-delivery apparatus and joins 89 coat protein dimers to form a capsid. This
atomic description of genome-capsid interactions in a spherical ssRNA virus
provides insight into genome delivery via the host sex pilus and mechanisms
underlying ssRNA-capsid co-assembly, and inspires speculation about the links
between nucleoprotein complexes and the origins of viruses.

'Blinking', or 'fluorescence intermittency', refers to a random switching between
'ON' (bright) and 'OFF' (dark) states of an emitter; it has been studied widely
in zero-dimensional quantum dots and molecules, and scarcely in one-dimensional
systems. A generally accepted mechanism for blinking in quantum dots involves
random switching between neutral and charged states (or is accompanied by
fluctuations in charge-carrier traps), which substantially alters the dynamics of
radiative and non-radiative decay. Here, we uncover a new type of blinking effect
in vertically stacked, two-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures, which
consist of two distinct monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
that are weakly coupled by van der Waals forces. Unlike zero-dimensional or
one-dimensional systems, two-dimensional TMD heterostructures show a correlated
blinking effect, comprising randomly switching bright, neutral and dark states.
Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy analyses show that a bright state
occurring in one monolayer will simultaneously lead to a dark state in the other 
monolayer, owing to an intermittent interlayer carrier-transfer process. Our
findings suggest that bilayer van der Waals heterostructures provide unique
platforms for the study of charge-transfer dynamics and non-equilibrium-state
physics, and could see application as correlated light emitters in quantum
technology.

The precise control of an ion channel gate by environmental stimuli is crucial
for the fulfilment of its biological role. The gate in Slo1 K+ channels is
regulated by two separate stimuli, intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane 
voltage. Slo1 is thus central to understanding the relationship between
intracellular Ca2+ and membrane excitability. Here we present the Slo1 structure 
from Aplysia californica in the absence of Ca2+ and compare it with the
Ca2+-bound channel. We show that Ca2+ binding at two unique binding sites per
subunit stabilizes an expanded conformation of the Ca2+ sensor gating ring. These
conformational changes are propagated from the gating ring to the pore through
covalent linkers and through protein interfaces formed between the gating ring
and the voltage sensors. The gating ring and the voltage sensors are directly
connected through these interfaces, which allow membrane voltage to regulate
gating of the pore by influencing the Ca2+ sensors.

The Ca2+-activated K+ channel, Slo1, has an unusually large conductance and
contains a voltage sensor and multiple chemical sensors. Dual activation by
membrane voltage and Ca2+ renders Slo1 central to processes that couple
electrical signalling to Ca2+-mediated events such as muscle contraction and
neuronal excitability. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of 
a full-length Slo1 channel from Aplysia californica in the presence of Ca2+ and
Mg2+ at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The channel adopts an open conformation. Its
voltage-sensor domain adopts a non-domain-swapped attachment to the pore and
contacts the cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding domain from a neighbouring subunit. Unique 
structural features of the Slo1 voltage sensor suggest that it undergoes
different conformational changes than other known voltage sensors. The structure 
reveals the molecular details of three distinct divalent cation-binding sites
identified through electrophysiological studies of mutant Slo1 channels.

The fact that the identity of the cells that initiate metastasis in most human
cancers is unknown hampers the development of antimetastatic therapies. Here we
describe a subpopulation of CD44bright cells in human oral carcinomas that do not
overexpress mesenchymal genes, are slow-cycling, express high levels of the fatty
acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes, and are unique in their ability to
initiate metastasis. Palmitic acid or a high-fat diet specifically boosts the
metastatic potential of CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells in a CD36-dependent
manner. The use of neutralizing antibodies to block CD36 causes almost complete
inhibition of metastasis in immunodeficient or immunocompetent orthotopic mouse
models of human oral cancer, with no side effects. Clinically, the presence of
CD36+ metastasis-initiating cells correlates with a poor prognosis for numerous
types of carcinomas, and inhibition of CD36 also impairs metastasis, at least in 
human melanoma- and breast cancer-derived tumours. Together, our results indicate
that metastasis-initiating cells particularly rely on dietary lipids to promote
metastasis.

Proxy-based indicators of past climate change show that current global climate
models systematically underestimate Holocene-epoch climate variability on
centennial to multi-millennial timescales, with the mismatch increasing for
longer periods. Proposed explanations for the discrepancy include
ocean-atmosphere coupling that is too weak in models, insufficient energy
cascades from smaller to larger spatial and temporal scales, or that global
climate models do not consider slow climate feedbacks related to the carbon cycle
or interactions between ice sheets and climate. Such interactions, however, are
known to have strongly affected centennial- to orbital-scale climate variability 
during past glaciations, and are likely to be important in future climate change.
Here we show that fluctuations in Antarctic Ice Sheet discharge caused by
relatively small changes in subsurface ocean temperature can amplify
multi-centennial climate variability regionally and globally, suggesting that a
dynamic Antarctic Ice Sheet may have driven climate fluctuations during the
Holocene. We analysed high-temporal-resolution records of iceberg-rafted debris
derived from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and performed both high-spatial-resolution 
ice-sheet modelling of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and multi-millennial global
climate model simulations. Ice-sheet responses to decadal-scale ocean forcing
appear to be less important, possibly indicating that the future response of the 
Antarctic Ice Sheet will be governed more by long-term anthropogenic warming
combined with multi-centennial natural variability than by annual or decadal
climate oscillations.

Ageing is driven by a loss of transcriptional and protein homeostasis and is the 
key risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Interventions that attenuate or
reverse systemic dysfunction associated with age therefore have the potential to 
reduce overall disease risk in the elderly. Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is
a fundamental link between gene expression and the proteome, and deregulation of 
the splicing machinery is linked to several age-related chronic illnesses.
However, the role of splicing homeostasis in healthy ageing remains unclear. Here
we demonstrate that pre-mRNA splicing homeostasis is a biomarker and predictor of
life expectancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using transcriptomics and in-depth
splicing analysis in young and old animals fed ad libitum or subjected to dietary
restriction, we find defects in global pre-mRNA splicing with age that are
reduced by dietary restriction via splicing factor 1 (SFA-1; the C. elegans
homologue of SF1, also known as branchpoint binding protein, BBP). We show that
SFA-1 is specifically required for lifespan extension by dietary restriction and 
by modulation of the TORC1 pathway components AMPK, RAGA-1 and RSKS-1/S6 kinase. 
We also demonstrate that overexpression of SFA-1 is sufficient to extend
lifespan. Together, these data demonstrate a role for RNA splicing homeostasis in
dietary restriction longevity and suggest that modulation of specific spliceosome
components may prolong healthy ageing.

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the largest potential sources of rising
sea levels. Over the past 40 years, glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea sector
of the ice sheet have thinned at an accelerating rate, and several numerical
models suggest that unstable and irreversible retreat of the grounding line-which
marks the boundary between grounded ice and floating ice shelf-is underway.
Understanding this recent retreat requires a detailed knowledge of grounding-line
history, but the locations of the grounding line before the advent of satellite
monitoring in the 1990s are poorly dated. In particular, a history of
grounding-line retreat is required to understand the relative roles of
contemporaneous ocean-forced change and of ongoing glacier response to an earlier
perturbation in driving ice-sheet loss. Here we show that the present thinning
and retreat of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica is part of a climatically
forced trend that was triggered in the 1940s. Our conclusions arise from analysis
of sediment cores recovered beneath the floating Pine Island Glacier ice shelf,
and constrain the date at which the grounding line retreated from a prominent
seafloor ridge. We find that incursion of marine water beyond the crest of this
ridge, forming an ocean cavity beneath the ice shelf, occurred in 1945 (±12
years); final ungrounding of the ice shelf from the ridge occurred in 1970 (±4
years). The initial opening of this ocean cavity followed a period of strong
warming of West Antarctica, associated with El Niño activity. Thus our results
suggest that, even when climate forcing weakened, ice-sheet retreat continued.

Reconstructing the lineage relationships and dynamic event histories of
individual cells within their native spatial context is a long-standing challenge
in biology. Many biological processes of interest occur in optically opaque or
physically inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches other than direct
imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system that enables cells to record lineage
information and event histories in the genome in a format that can be
subsequently read out of single cells in situ. This system, termed memory by
engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout (MEMOIR), is based on a set
of barcoded recording elements termed scratchpads. The state of a given
scratchpad can be irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis,
and later read out in single cells through multiplexed single-molecule RNA
fluorescence hybridization (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we
engineered mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and other
recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were altered in a progressive
and stochastic fashion as the cells proliferated. Analysis of the final states of
scratchpads in single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage information
from cell colonies. Combining analysis of endogenous gene expression with lineage
reconstruction in the same cells further allowed inference of the dynamic rates
at which embryonic stem cells switch between two gene expression states. Finally,
using simulations, we show how parallel MEMOIR systems operating in the same cell
could enable recording and readout of dynamic cellular event histories. MEMOIR
thus provides a versatile platform for information recording and in situ,
single-cell readout across diverse biological systems.

Fast radio bursts are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature with 
durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an
extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities that are orders of magnitude
larger than those of all known short-duration radio transients. So far all fast
radio bursts have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute 
localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host
galaxy) have relied on the contemporaneous variability of field sources or the
presence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted in
an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here we
report the subarcsecond localization of the fast radio burst FRB 121102, the only
known repeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric
observations that directly image the bursts. Our precise localization reveals
that FRB 121102 originates within 100 milliarcseconds of a faint 180-microJansky 
persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with
non-thermal emission, and a faint (twenty-fifth magnitude) optical counterpart.
The flux density of the persistent radio source varies by around ten per cent on 
day timescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular
size of less than 1.7 milliarcseconds. Our observations are inconsistent with the
fast radio burst having a Galactic origin or its source being located within a
prominent star-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with 
a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of
extragalactic source. Localization and identification of a host or counterpart
has been essential to understanding the origins and physics of other kinds of
transient events, including gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events.
However, if other fast radio bursts have similarly faint radio and optical
counterparts, our findings imply that direct subarcsecond localizations may be
the only way to provide reliable associations.

Hydrogen spillover is the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from a
metal catalyst particle, on which they are generated, onto the catalyst support. 
The phenomenon has been much studied and its occurrence on reducible supports
such as titanium oxide is established, yet questions remain about whether
hydrogen spillover can take place on nonreducible supports such as aluminium
oxide. Here we use the enhanced precision of top-down nanofabrication to prepare 
controlled and precisely tunable model systems that allow us to quantify the
efficiency and spatial extent of hydrogen spillover on both reducible and
nonreducible supports. We place multiple pairs of iron oxide and platinum
nanoparticles on titanium oxide and aluminium oxide supports, varying the
distance between the pairs from zero to 45 nanometres with a precision of one
nanometre. We then observe the extent of the reduction of the iron oxide
particles by hydrogen atoms generated on the platinum using single-particle in
situ X-ray absorption spectromicroscopy applied simultaneously to all particle
pairs. The data, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations,
reveal fast hydrogen spillover on titanium oxide that reduces remote iron oxide
nanoparticles via coupled proton-electron transfer. In contrast, spillover on
aluminium oxide is mediated by three-coordinated aluminium centres that also
interact with water and that give rise to hydrogen mobility competing with
hydrogen desorption; this results in hydrogen spillover about ten orders of
magnitude slower than on titanium oxide and restricted to very short distances
from the platinum particle. We anticipate that these observations will improve
our understanding of hydrogen storage and catalytic reactions involving hydrogen,
and that our approach to creating and probing model catalyst systems will provide
opportunities for studying the origin of synergistic effects in supported
catalysts that combine multiple functionalities.
