Two-pore channels (TPCs) contain two copies of a Shaker-like six-transmembrane
(6-TM) domain in each subunit and are ubiquitously expressed in both animals and 
plants as organellar cation channels. Here we present the crystal structure of a 
vacuolar two-pore channel from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtTPC1, which functions as a
homodimer. AtTPC1 activation requires both voltage and cytosolic Ca(2+). Ca(2+)
binding to the cytosolic EF-hand domain triggers conformational changes coupled
to the pair of pore-lining inner helices from the first 6-TM domains, whereas
membrane potential only activates the second voltage-sensing domain, the
conformational changes of which are coupled to the pair of inner helices from the
second 6-TM domains. Luminal Ca(2+) or Ba(2+) can modulate voltage activation by 
stabilizing the second voltage-sensing domain in the resting state and shift
voltage activation towards more positive potentials. Our Ba(2+)-bound AtTPC1
structure reveals a voltage sensor in the resting state, providing hitherto
unseen structural insight into the general voltage-gating mechanism among
voltage-gated channels.

Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet
comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable 
in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major
traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of
vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional 
trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs.
Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global
spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane
reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf 
economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth
potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating
constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and
for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation
in plant form and function.

To understand the complex physics of a system with strong electron-electron
interactions, the ideal is to control and monitor its properties while tuning an 
external electric field applied to the system (the electric-field effect).
Indeed, complete electric-field control of many-body states in strongly
correlated electron systems is fundamental to the next generation of condensed
matter research and devices. However, the material must be thin enough to avoid
shielding of the electric field in the bulk material. Two-dimensional materials
do not experience electrical screening, and their charge-carrier density can be
controlled by gating. Octahedral titanium diselenide (1T-TiSe2) is a prototypical
two-dimensional material that reveals a charge-density wave (CDW) and
superconductivity in its phase diagram, presenting several similarities with
other layered systems such as copper oxides, iron pnictides, and crystals of
rare-earth elements and actinide atoms. By studying 1T-TiSe2 single crystals with
thicknesses of 10 nanometres or less, encapsulated in two-dimensional layers of
hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve unprecedented control over the CDW transition
temperature (tuned from 170 kelvin to 40 kelvin), and over the superconductivity 
transition temperature (tuned from a quantum critical point at 0 kelvin up to
3 kelvin). Electrically driving TiSe2 over different ordered electronic phases
allows us to study the details of the phase transitions between many-body states.
Observations of periodic oscillations of magnetoresistance induced by the
Little-Parks effect show that the appearance of superconductivity is directly
correlated with the spatial texturing of the amplitude and phase of the
superconductivity order parameter, corresponding to a two-dimensional matrix of
superconductivity. We infer that this superconductivity matrix is supported by a 
matrix of incommensurate CDW states embedded in the commensurate CDW states. Our 
results show that spatially modulated electronic states are fundamental to the
appearance of two-dimensional superconductivity.

Phenotypic traits and their associated trade-offs have been shown to have
globally consistent effects on individual plant physiological functions, but how 
these effects scale up to influence competition, a key driver of community
assembly in terrestrial vegetation, has remained unclear. Here we use growth data
from more than 3 million trees in over 140,000 plots across the world to show how
three key functional traits--wood density, specific leaf area and maximum
height--consistently influence competitive interactions. Fast maximum growth of a
species was correlated negatively with its wood density in all biomes, and
positively with its specific leaf area in most biomes. Low wood density was also 
correlated with a low ability to tolerate competition and a low competitive
effect on neighbours, while high specific leaf area was correlated with a low
competitive effect. Thus, traits generate trade-offs between performance with
competition versus performance without competition, a fundamental ingredient in
the classical hypothesis that the coexistence of plant species is enabled via
differentiation in their successional strategies. Competition within species was 
stronger than between species, but an increase in trait dissimilarity between
species had little influence in weakening competition. No benefit of
dissimilarity was detected for specific leaf area or wood density, and only a
weak benefit for maximum height. Our trait-based approach to modelling
competition makes generalization possible across the forest ecosystems of the
world and their highly diverse species composition.

Rapid removal of organic micropollutants from water by a porous β-cyclodextrin
polymer.

The global occurrence in water resources of organic micropollutants, such as
pesticides and pharmaceuticals, has raised concerns about potential negative
effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. Activated carbons are the most
widespread adsorbent materials used to remove organic pollutants from water but
they have several deficiencies, including slow pollutant uptake (of the order of 
hours) and poor removal of many relatively hydrophilic micropollutants.
Furthermore, regenerating spent activated carbon is energy intensive (requiring
heating to 500-900 degrees Celsius) and does not fully restore performance.
Insoluble polymers of β-cyclodextrin, an inexpensive, sustainably produced
macrocycle of glucose, are likewise of interest for removing micropollutants from
water by means of adsorption. β-cyclodextrin is known to encapsulate pollutants
to form well-defined host-guest complexes, but until now cross-linked
β-cyclodextrin polymers have had low surface areas and poor removal performance
compared to conventional activated carbons. Here we crosslink β-cyclodextrin with
rigid aromatic groups, providing a high-surface-area, mesoporous polymer of
β-cyclodextrin. It rapidly sequesters a variety of organic micropollutants with
adsorption rate constants 15 to 200 times greater than those of activated carbons
and non-porous β-cyclodextrin adsorbent materials. In addition, the polymer can
be regenerated several times using a mild washing procedure with no loss in
performance. Finally, the polymer outperformed a leading activated carbon for the
rapid removal of a complex mixture of organic micropollutants at environmentally 
relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate the promise of porous
cyclodextrin-based polymers for rapid, flow-through water treatment.

Parasitic helminths and allergens induce a type 2 immune response leading to
profound changes in tissue physiology, including hyperplasia of mucus-secreting
goblet cells and smooth muscle hypercontractility. This response, known as 'weep 
and sweep', requires interleukin (IL)-13 production by tissue-resident group 2
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and recruited type 2 helper T cells (TH2 cells).
Experiments in mice and humans have demonstrated requirements for the epithelial 
cytokines IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-25 in the activation 
of ILC2s, but the sources and regulation of these signals remain poorly defined. 
In the small intestine, the epithelium consists of at least five distinct
cellular lineages, including the tuft cell, whose function is unclear. Here we
show that tuft cells constitutively express IL-25 to sustain ILC2 homeostasis in 
the resting lamina propria in mice. After helminth infection, tuft-cell-derived
IL-25 further activates ILC2s to secrete IL-13, which acts on epithelial crypt
progenitors to promote differentiation of tuft and goblet cells, leading to
increased frequencies of both. Tuft cells, ILC2s and epithelial progenitors
therefore comprise a response circuit that mediates epithelial remodelling
associated with type 2 immunity in the small intestine, and perhaps at other
mucosal barriers populated by these cells.

Gain-of-function IDH mutations are initiating events that define major clinical
and prognostic classes of gliomas. Mutant IDH protein produces a new
onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with iron-dependent
hydroxylases, including the TET family of 5'-methylcytosine hydroxylases. TET
enzymes catalyse a key step in the removal of DNA methylation. IDH mutant gliomas
thus manifest a CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), although the functional
importance of this altered epigenetic state remains unclear. Here we show that
human IDH mutant gliomas exhibit hypermethylation at cohesin and CCCTC-binding
factor (CTCF)-binding sites, compromising binding of this methylation-sensitive
insulator protein. Reduced CTCF binding is associated with loss of insulation
between topological domains and aberrant gene activation. We specifically
demonstrate that loss of CTCF at a domain boundary permits a constitutive
enhancer to interact aberrantly with the receptor tyrosine kinase gene PDGFRA, a 
prominent glioma oncogene. Treatment of IDH mutant gliomaspheres with a
demethylating agent partially restores insulator function and downregulates
PDGFRA. Conversely, CRISPR-mediated disruption of the CTCF motif in IDH wild-type
gliomaspheres upregulates PDGFRA and increases proliferation. Our study suggests 
that IDH mutations promote gliomagenesis by disrupting chromosomal topology and
allowing aberrant regulatory interactions that induce oncogene expression.

Plasmodium falciparum antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes 
are important targets of naturally acquired immunity against malaria, but their
high number and variability provide the pathogen with a powerful means of escape 
from host antibodies. Although broadly reactive antibodies against these antigens
could be useful as therapeutics and in vaccine design, their identification has
proven elusive. Here we report the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that 
recognize erythrocytes infected by different P. falciparum isolates and opsonize 
these cells by binding to members of the RIFIN family. These antibodies acquired 
broad reactivity through a novel mechanism of insertion of a large DNA fragment
between the V and DJ segments. The insert, which is both necessary and sufficient
for binding to RIFINs, encodes the entire 98 amino acid collagen-binding domain
of LAIR1, an immunoglobulin superfamily inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome
19. In each of the two donors studied, the antibodies are produced by a single
expanded B-cell clone and carry distinct somatic mutations in the LAIR1 domain
that abolish binding to collagen and increase binding to infected erythrocytes.
These findings illustrate, with a biologically relevant example, a novel
mechanism of antibody diversification by interchromosomal DNA transposition and
demonstrate the existence of conserved epitopes that may be suitable candidates
for the development of a malaria vaccine.

Colorectal cancer remains a major unmet medical need, prompting large-scale
genomics efforts in the field to identify molecular drivers for which targeted
therapies might be developed. We previously reported the identification of
recurrent translocations in R-spondin genes present in a subset of colorectal
tumours. Here we show that targeting RSPO3 in PTPRK-RSPO3-fusion-positive human
tumour xenografts inhibits tumour growth and promotes differentiation. Notably,
genes expressed in the stem-cell compartment of the intestine were among those
most sensitive to anti-RSPO3 treatment. This observation, combined with
functional assays, suggests that a stem-cell compartment drives PTPRK-RSPO3
colorectal tumour growth and indicates that the therapeutic targeting of
stem-cell properties within tumours may be a clinically relevant approach for the
treatment of colorectal tumours.

The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) subunit
POLR2A is a platform for modifications specifying the recruitment of factors that
regulate transcription, mRNA processing, and chromatin remodelling. Here we show 
that a CTD arginine residue (R1810 in human) that is conserved across vertebrates
is symmetrically dimethylated (me2s). This R1810me2s modification requires
protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and recruits the Tudor domain of the
survival of motor neuron (SMN, also known as GEMIN1) protein, which is mutated in
spinal muscular atrophy. SMN interacts with senataxin, which is sometimes mutated
in ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because
POLR2A R1810me2s and SMN, like senataxin, are required for resolving RNA-DNA
hybrids created by RNA polymerase II that form R-loops in transcription
termination regions, we propose that R1810me2s, SMN, and senataxin are components
of an R-loop resolution pathway. Defects in this pathway can influence
transcription termination and may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders.

Carbon dioxide is the ultimate source of the fossil fuels that are both central
to modern life and problematic: their use increases atmospheric levels of
greenhouse gases, and their availability is geopolitically constrained. Using
carbon dioxide as a feedstock to produce synthetic fuels might, in principle,
alleviate these concerns. Although many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts
convert carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, further deoxygenative coupling of
carbon monoxide to generate useful multicarbon products is challenging.
Molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases are capable of converting carbon monoxide
into hydrocarbons under mild conditions, using discrete electron and proton
sources. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon monoxide on copper catalysts also
uses a combination of electrons and protons, while the industrial Fischer-Tropsch
process uses dihydrogen as a combined source of electrons and electrophiles for
carbon monoxide coupling at high temperatures and pressures. However, these
enzymatic and heterogeneous systems are difficult to probe mechanistically.
Molecular catalysts have been studied extensively to investigate the elementary
steps by which carbon monoxide is deoxygenated and coupled, but a single metal
site that can efficiently induce the required scission of carbon-oxygen bonds and
generate carbon-carbon bonds has not yet been documented. Here we describe a
molybdenum compound, supported by a terphenyl-diphosphine ligand, that activates 
and cleaves the strong carbon-oxygen bond of carbon monoxide, enacts
carbon-carbon coupling, and spontaneously dissociates the resulting fragment.
This complex four-electron transformation is enabled by the terphenyl-diphosphine
ligand, which acts as an electron reservoir and exhibits the coordinative
flexibility needed to stabilize the different intermediates involved in the
overall reaction sequence. We anticipate that these design elements might help in
the development of efficient catalysts for converting carbon monoxide to chemical
fuels, and should prove useful in the broader context of performing complex
multi-electron transformations at a single metal site.

Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered, but spectral analysis of
their atmospheres has so far been dominated by a small number of exoplanets and
data spanning relatively narrow wavelength ranges (such as 1.1-1.7 micrometres). 
Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much weaker water
absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted. The low
amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water abundances,
which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary disk at the
planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level of depletion
can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the result of
obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra. Here we report 
results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering the wavelength
range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the optical scattering
and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our results reveal a diverse
group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from clear to cloudy atmospheres. 
We find that the difference between the planetary radius measured at optical and 
infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for distinguishing different
atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the spectral strength of water, 
so that strong water absorption lines are seen in clear-atmosphere planets and
the weakest features are associated with clouds and hazes. This result strongly
suggests that primordial water depletion during formation is unlikely and that
clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker spectral signatures.

Understanding how ecological communities are organized and how they change
through time is critical to predicting the effects of climate change. Recent work
documenting the co-occurrence structure of modern communities found that most
significant species pairs co-occur less frequently than would be expected by
chance. However, little is known about how co-occurrence structure changes
through time. Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization
over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique
taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences
of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were
spatially aggregated or segregated. Aggregated pairs dominated from the
Carboniferous period (307 million years ago) to the early Holocene epoch (11,700 
years before present), when there was a pronounced shift to more segregated
pairs, a trend that continues in modern assemblages. The shift began during the
Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size and the spread of
agriculture in North America. Before the shift, an average of 64% of significant 
pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37%. The
organization of modern and late Holocene plant and animal assemblages differs
fundamentally from that of assemblages over the past 300 million years that
predate the large-scale impacts of humans. Our results suggest that the rules
governing the assembly of communities have recently been changed by human
activity.

Recent research has highlighted a strong correlation between tissue-specific
cancer risk and the lifetime number of tissue-specific stem-cell divisions.
Whether such correlation implies a high unavoidable intrinsic cancer risk has
become a key public health debate with the dissemination of the 'bad luck'
hypothesis. Here we provide evidence that intrinsic risk factors contribute only 
modestly (less than ~10-30% of lifetime risk) to cancer development. First, we
demonstrate that the correlation between stem-cell division and cancer risk does 
not distinguish between the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We then
show that intrinsic risk is better estimated by the lower bound risk controlling 
for total stem-cell divisions. Finally, we show that the rates of endogenous
mutation accumulation by intrinsic processes are not sufficient to account for
the observed cancer risks. Collectively, we conclude that cancer risk is heavily 
influenced by extrinsic factors. These results are important for strategizing
cancer prevention, research and public health.

Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) is a critical regulator of an
organism's most important biological decisions from growth, development, and
metabolism to reproduction and longevity. It primarily does so through the
activity of the DAF-16 transcription factor (forkhead box O (FOXO) homologue),
whose global targets were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans using whole-worm
transcriptional analyses more than a decade ago. IIS and FOXO also regulate
important neuronal and adult behavioural phenotypes, such as the maintenance of
memory and axon regeneration with age, in both mammals and C. elegans, but the
neuron-specific IIS/FOXO targets that regulate these functions are still unknown.
By isolating adult C. elegans neurons for transcriptional profiling, we
identified both the wild-type and IIS/FOXO mutant adult neuronal transcriptomes
for the first time. IIS/FOXO neuron-specific targets are distinct from canonical 
IIS/FOXO-regulated longevity and metabolism targets, and are required for
extended memory in IIS daf-2 mutants. The activity of the forkhead transcription 
factor FKH-9 in neurons is required for the ability of daf-2 mutants to
regenerate axons with age, and its activity in non-neuronal tissues is required
for the long lifespan of daf-2 mutants. Together, neuron-specific and canonical
IIS/FOXO-regulated targets enable the coordinated extension of neuronal
activities, metabolism, and longevity under low-insulin signalling conditions.

Terrestrial volcanic eruptions are the consequence of magmas ascending to the
surface of the Earth. This ascent is driven by buoyancy forces, which are
enhanced by bubble nucleation and growth (vesiculation) that reduce the density
of magma. The development of vesicularity also greatly reduces the 'strength' of 
magma, a material parameter controlling fragmentation and thus the explosive
potential of the liquid rock. The development of vesicularity in magmas has until
now been viewed (both thermodynamically and kinetically) in terms of the pressure
dependence of the solubility of water in the magma, and its role in driving gas
saturation, exsolution and expansion during decompression. In contrast, the
possible effects of the well documented negative temperature dependence of
solubility of water in magma has largely been ignored. Recently, petrological
constraints have demonstrated that considerable heating of magma may indeed be a 
common result of the latent heat of crystallization as well as viscous and
frictional heating in areas of strain localization. Here we present field and
experimental observations of magma vesiculation and fragmentation resulting from 
heating (rather than decompression). Textural analysis of volcanic ash from
Santiaguito volcano in Guatemala reveals the presence of chemically heterogeneous
filaments hosting micrometre-scale vesicles. The textures mirror those developed 
by disequilibrium melting induced via rapid heating during fault friction
experiments, demonstrating that friction can generate sufficient heat to induce
melting and vesiculation of hydrated silicic magma. Consideration of the
experimentally determined temperature and pressure dependence of water solubility
in magma reveals that, for many ascent paths, exsolution may be more efficiently 
achieved by heating than by decompression. We conclude that the thermal path
experienced by magma during ascent strongly controls degassing, vesiculation,
magma strength and the effusive-explosive transition in volcanic eruptions.

Magnesium is a light metal, with a density two-thirds that of aluminium, is
abundant on Earth and is biocompatible; it thus has the potential to improve
energy efficiency and system performance in aerospace, automobile, defence,
mobile electronics and biomedical applications. However, conventional synthesis
and processing methods (alloying and thermomechanical processing) have reached
certain limits in further improving the properties of magnesium and other metals.
Ceramic particles have been introduced into metal matrices to improve the
strength of the metals, but unfortunately, ceramic microparticles severely
degrade the plasticity and machinability of metals, and nanoparticles, although
they have the potential to improve strength while maintaining or even improving
the plasticity of metals, are difficult to disperse uniformly in metal matrices. 
Here we show that a dense uniform dispersion of silicon carbide nanoparticles (14
per cent by volume) in magnesium can be achieved through a nanoparticle
self-stabilization mechanism in molten metal. An enhancement of strength,
stiffness, plasticity and high-temperature stability is simultaneously achieved, 
delivering a higher specific yield strength and higher specific modulus than
almost all structural metals.

Data transport across short electrical wires is limited by both bandwidth and
power density, which creates a performance bottleneck for semiconductor
microchips in modern computer systems--from mobile phones to large-scale data
centres. These limitations can be overcome by using optical communications based 
on chip-scale electronic-photonic systems enabled by silicon-based nanophotonic
devices. However, combining electronics and photonics on the same chip has proved
challenging, owing to microchip manufacturing conflicts between electronics and
photonics. Consequently, current electronic-photonic chips are limited to niche
manufacturing processes and include only a few optical devices alongside simple
circuits. Here we report an electronic-photonic system on a single chip
integrating over 70 million transistors and 850 photonic components that work
together to provide logic, memory, and interconnect functions. This system is a
realization of a microprocessor that uses on-chip photonic devices to directly
communicate with other chips using light. To integrate electronics and photonics 
at the scale of a microprocessor chip, we adopt a 'zero-change' approach to the
integration of photonics. Instead of developing a custom process to enable the
fabrication of photonics, which would complicate or eliminate the possibility of 
integration with state-of-the-art transistors at large scale and at high yield,
we design optical devices using a standard microelectronics foundry process that 
is used for modern microprocessors. This demonstration could represent the
beginning of an era of chip-scale electronic-photonic systems with the potential 
to transform computing system architectures, enabling more powerful computers,
from network infrastructure to data centres and supercomputers.

The quantum superposition principle allows massive particles to be delocalized
over distant positions. Though quantum mechanics has proved adept at describing
the microscopic world, quantum superposition runs counter to intuitive
conceptions of reality and locality when extended to the macroscopic scale, as
exemplified by the thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat. Matter-wave
interferometers, which split and recombine wave packets in order to observe
interference, provide a way to probe the superposition principle on macroscopic
scales and explore the transition to classical physics. In such experiments,
large wave-packet separation is impeded by the need for long interaction times
and large momentum beam splitters, which cause susceptibility to dephasing and
decoherence. Here we use light-pulse atom interferometry to realize quantum
interference with wave packets separated by up to 54 centimetres on a timescale
of 1 second. These results push quantum superposition into a new macroscopic
regime, demonstrating that quantum superposition remains possible at the
distances and timescales of everyday life. The sub-nanokelvin temperatures of the
atoms and a compensation of transverse optical forces enable a large separation
while maintaining an interference contrast of 28 per cent. In addition to testing
the superposition principle in a new regime, large quantum superposition states
are vital to exploring gravity with atom interferometers in greater detail. We
anticipate that these states could be used to increase sensitivity in tests of
the equivalence principle, measure the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect, and
eventually detect gravitational waves and phase shifts associated with general
relativity.

Coronal mass ejections are solar eruptions driven by a sudden release of magnetic
energy stored in the Sun's corona. In many cases, this magnetic energy is stored 
in long-lived, arched structures called magnetic flux ropes. When a flux rope
destabilizes, it can either erupt and produce a coronal mass ejection or fail and
collapse back towards the Sun. The prevailing belief is that the outcome of a
given event is determined by a magnetohydrodynamic force imbalance called the
torus instability. This belief is challenged, however, by observations indicating
that torus-unstable flux ropes sometimes fail to erupt. This contradiction has
not yet been resolved because of a lack of coronal magnetic field measurements
and the limitations of idealized numerical modelling. Here we report the results 
of a laboratory experiment that reveal a previously unknown eruption criterion
below which torus-unstable flux ropes fail to erupt. We find that such 'failed
torus' events occur when the guide magnetic field (that is, the ambient field
that runs toroidally along the flux rope) is strong enough to prevent the flux
rope from kinking. Under these conditions, the guide field interacts with
electric currents in the flux rope to produce a dynamic toroidal field tension
force that halts the eruption. This magnetic tension force is missing from
existing eruption models, which is why such models cannot explain or predict
failed torus events.

Tandem repeat proteins, which are formed by repetition of modular units of
protein sequence and structure, play important biological roles as macromolecular
binding and scaffolding domains, enzymes, and building blocks for the assembly of
fibrous materials. The modular nature of repeat proteins enables the rapid
construction and diversification of extended binding surfaces by duplication and 
recombination of simple building blocks. The overall architecture of tandem
repeat protein structures--which is dictated by the internal geometry and local
packing of the repeat building blocks--is highly diverse, ranging from extended, 
super-helical folds that bind peptide, DNA, and RNA partners, to closed and
compact conformations with internal cavities suitable for small molecule binding 
and catalysis. Here we report the development and validation of computational
methods for de novo design of tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely
by geometric criteria defining the inter-repeat geometry, without reference to
the sequences and structures of existing repeat protein families. We have applied
these methods to design a series of closed α-solenoid repeat structures
(α-toroids) in which the inter-repeat packing geometry is constrained so as to
juxtapose the amino (N) and carboxy (C) termini; several of these designed
structures have been validated by X-ray crystallography. Unlike previous
approaches to tandem repeat protein engineering, our design procedure does not
rely on template sequence or structural information taken from natural repeat
proteins and hence can produce structures unlike those seen in nature. As an
example, we have successfully designed and validated closed α-solenoid repeats
with a left-handed helical architecture that--to our knowledge--is not yet
present in the protein structure database.

Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are key determinants of gene activity, yet
they bind only a fraction of their corresponding DNA sequence motifs in any given
cell type. Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding
sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding 
remains mainly unknown. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to
constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem
cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted
sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1.
In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the
unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo
methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes
NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylation-sensitive TFs relies 
on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this
model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local
hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between
DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that 
acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by
methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive
factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.

A central question in protein evolution is the extent to which naturally
occurring proteins sample the space of folded structures accessible to the
polypeptide chain. Repeat proteins composed of multiple tandem copies of a
modular structure unit are widespread in nature and have critical roles in
molecular recognition, signalling, and other essential biological processes.
Naturally occurring repeat proteins have been re-engineered for molecular
recognition and modular scaffolding applications. Here we use computational
protein design to investigate the space of folded structures that can be
generated by tandem repeating a simple helix-loop-helix-loop structural motif.
Eighty-three designs with sequences unrelated to known repeat proteins were
experimentally characterized. Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95 °C, and
43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models.
Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in
close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging
from 0.7 to 2.5 Å. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a
small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and
that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified
geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular
engineering.

The rapid diversification of angiosperms through the Early Cretaceous period,
between about 130-100 million years ago, initiated fundamental changes in the
composition of terrestrial vegetation and is increasingly well understood on the 
basis of a wealth of palaeobotanical discoveries over the past four decades and
their integration with improved knowledge of living angiosperms. Prevailing
hypotheses, based on evidence both from living and from fossil plants, emphasize 
that the earliest angiosperms were plants of small stature with rapid life cycles
that exploited disturbed habitats in open, or perhaps understorey, conditions.
However, direct palaeontogical data relevant to understanding the seed biology
and germination ecology of Early Cretaceous angiosperms are sparse. Here we
report the discovery of embryos and their associated nutrient storage tissues in 
exceptionally well-preserved angiosperm seeds from the Early Cretaceous.
Synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy of the fossil embryos from
many taxa reveals that all were tiny at the time of dispersal. These results
support hypotheses based on extant plants that tiny embryos and seed dormancy are
basic for angiosperms as a whole. The minute size of the fossil embryos, and the 
modest nutrient storage tissues dictated by the overall small seed size, is also 
consistent with the interpretation that many early angiosperms were
opportunistic, early successional colonizers of disturbance-prone habitats.

General strategies for the chemical synthesis of organic compounds, especially of
architecturally complex natural products, are not easily identified. Here we
present a method to establish a strategy for such syntheses, which uses network
analysis. This approach has led to the identification of a versatile synthetic
intermediate that facilitated syntheses of the diterpenoid alkaloids
weisaconitine D and liljestrandinine, and the core of gomandonine. We also
developed a web-based graphing program that allows network analysis to be easily 
performed on molecules with complex frameworks. The diterpenoid alkaloids
comprise some of the most architecturally complex and functional-group-dense
secondary metabolites isolated. Consequently, they present a substantial
challenge for chemical synthesis. The synthesis approach described here is a
notable departure from other single-target-focused strategies adopted for the
syntheses of related structures. Specifically, it affords not only the targeted
natural products, but also intermediates and derivatives in the three families of
diterpenoid alkaloids (C-18, C-19 and C-20), and so provides a unified synthetic 
strategy for these natural products. This work validates the utility of network
analysis as a starting point for identifying strategies for the syntheses of
architecturally complex secondary metabolites.

T helper 17 (TH17) lymphocytes protect mucosal barriers from infections, but also
contribute to multiple chronic inflammatory diseases. Their differentiation is
controlled by RORγt, a ligand-regulated nuclear receptor. Here we identify the
RNA helicase DEAD-box protein 5 (DDX5) as a RORγt partner that coordinates
transcription of selective TH17 genes, and is required for TH17-mediated
inflammatory pathologies. Surprisingly, the ability of DDX5 to interact with
RORγt and coactivate its targets depends on intrinsic RNA helicase activity and
binding of a conserved nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), Rmrp, which is
mutated in patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia. A targeted Rmrp gene mutation
in mice, corresponding to a gene mutation in cartilage-hair hypoplasia patients, 
altered lncRNA chromatin occupancy, and reduced the DDX5-RORγt interaction and
RORγt target gene transcription. Elucidation of the link between Rmrp and the
DDX5-RORγt complex reveals a role for RNA helicases and lncRNAs in
tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, and provides new opportunities for
therapeutic intervention in TH17-dependent diseases.

Variant rs351855-G/A is a commonly occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism of
coding regions in exon 9 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR4 (CD334)
gene (c.1162G>A). It results in an amino-acid change at codon 388 from glycine to
arginine (p.Gly388Arg) in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Despite
compelling genetic evidence for the association of this common variant with
cancers of the bone, breast, colon, prostate, skin, lung, head and neck, as well 
as soft-tissue sarcomas and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the underlying biological
mechanism has remained elusive. Here we show that substitution of the conserved
glycine 388 residue to a charged arginine residue alters the transmembrane
spanning segment and exposes a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) binding site Y(390)-(P)XXQ(393). We
demonstrate that such membrane-proximal STAT3 binding motifs in the germline of
type I membrane receptors enhance STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation by recruiting
STAT3 proteins to the inner cell membrane. Remarkably, such germline variants
frequently co-localize with somatic mutations in the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Using Fgfr4 single nucleotide polymorphism
knock-in mice and transgenic mouse models for breast and lung cancers, we
validate the enhanced STAT3 signalling induced by the FGFR4 Arg388-variant in
vivo. Thus, our findings elucidate the molecular mechanism behind the genetic
association of rs351855 with accelerated cancer progression and suggest that
germline variants of cell-surface molecules that recruit STAT3 to the inner cell 
membrane are a significant risk for cancer prognosis and disease progression.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major global health threat, replicates in
macrophages in part by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion, until interferon-γ
(IFNγ) activates the macrophage to traffic M. tuberculosis to the lysosome. How
IFNγ elicits this effect is unknown, but many studies suggest a role for
macroautophagy (herein termed autophagy), a process by which cytoplasmic contents
are targeted for lysosomal degradation. The involvement of autophagy has been
defined based on studies in cultured cells where M. tuberculosis co-localizes
with autophagy factors ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L1, p62, NDP52, BECN1 and LC3 (refs
2-6), stimulation of autophagy increases bacterial killing, and inhibition of
autophagy increases bacterial survival. Notably, these studies reveal modest
(~1.5-3-fold change) effects on M. tuberculosis replication. By contrast, mice
lacking ATG5 in monocyte-derived cells and neutrophils (polymorponuclear cells,
PMNs) succumb to M. tuberculosis within 30 days, an extremely severe phenotype
similar to mice lacking IFNγ signalling. Importantly, ATG5 is the only autophagy 
factor that has been studied during M. tuberculosis infection in vivo and
autophagy-independent functions of ATG5 have been described. For this reason, we 
used a genetic approach to elucidate the role for multiple autophagy-related
genes and the requirement for autophagy in resistance to M. tuberculosis
infection in vivo. Here we show that, contrary to expectation, autophagic
capacity does not correlate with the outcome of M. tuberculosis infection.
Instead, ATG5 plays a unique role in protection against M. tuberculosis by
preventing PMN-mediated immunopathology. Furthermore, while Atg5 is dispensable
in alveolar macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, loss of Atg5 in PMNs
can sensitize mice to M. tuberculosis. These findings shift our understanding of 
the role of ATG5 during M. tuberculosis infection, reveal new outcomes of ATG5
activity, and shed light on early events in innate immunity that are required to 
regulate disease pathology and bacterial replication.

Epithelial regeneration is critical for barrier maintenance and organ function
after intestinal injury. The intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche provides Wnt, Notch
and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signals supporting Lgr5(+) crypt base columnar 
ISCs for normal epithelial maintenance. However, little is known about the
regulation of the ISC compartment after tissue damage. Using ex vivo organoid
cultures, here we show that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), potent producers of
interleukin-22 (IL-22) after intestinal injury, increase the growth of mouse
small intestine organoids in an IL-22-dependent fashion. Recombinant IL-22
directly targeted ISCs, augmenting the growth of both mouse and human intestinal 
organoids, increasing proliferation and promoting ISC expansion. IL-22 induced
STAT3 phosphorylation in Lgr5(+) ISCs, and STAT3 was crucial for both organoid
formation and IL-22-mediated regeneration. Treatment with IL-22 in vivo after
mouse allogeneic bone marrow transplantation enhanced the recovery of ISCs,
increased epithelial regeneration and reduced intestinal pathology and mortality 
from graft-versus-host disease. ATOH1-deficient organoid culture demonstrated
that IL-22 induced epithelial regeneration independently of the Paneth cell
niche. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism by which the immune system is 
able to support the intestinal epithelium, activating ISCs to promote
regeneration.

Fast radio bursts are bright, unresolved, non-repeating, broadband, millisecond
flashes, found primarily at high Galactic latitudes, with dispersion measures
much larger than expected for a Galactic source. The inferred all-sky burst rate 
is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate out to redshift 0.5. If the
observed dispersion measures are assumed to be dominated by the intergalactic
medium, the sources are at cosmological distances with redshifts of 0.2 to 1
(refs 10 and 11). These parameters are consistent with a wide range of source
models. One fast burst revealed circular polarization of the radio emission, but 
no linear polarization was detected, and hence no Faraday rotation measure could 
be determined. Here we report the examination of archival data revealing Faraday 
rotation in the fast radio burst FRB 110523. Its radio flux and dispersion
measure are consistent with values from previously reported bursts and,
accounting for a Galactic contribution to the dispersion and using a model of
intergalactic electron density, we place the source at a maximum redshift of 0.5.
The burst has a much higher rotation measure than expected for this line of sight
through the Milky Way and the intergalactic medium, indicating magnetization in
the vicinity of the source itself or within a host galaxy. The pulse was
scattered by two distinct plasma screens during propagation, which requires
either a dense nebula associated with the source or a location within the central
region of its host galaxy. The detection in this instance of magnetization and
scattering that are both local to the source favours models involving young
stellar populations such as magnetars over models involving the mergers of older 
neutron stars, which are more likely to be located in low-density regions of the 
host galaxy.

Deletion of phenylalanine 508 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (∆F508 CFTR) is the major cause of cystic fibrosis, one of the most
common inherited childhood diseases. The mutated CFTR anion channel is not fully 
glycosylated and shows minimal activity in bronchial epithelial cells of patients
with cystic fibrosis. Low temperature or inhibition of histone deacetylases can
partly rescue ∆F508 CFTR cellular processing defects and function. A favourable
change of ∆F508 CFTR protein-protein interactions was proposed as a mechanism of 
rescue; however, CFTR interactome dynamics during temperature shift and
inhibition of histone deacetylases are unknown. Here we report the first
comprehensive analysis of the CFTR and ∆F508 CFTR interactome and its dynamics
during temperature shift and inhibition of histone deacetylases. By using a novel
deep proteomic analysis method, we identify 638 individual high-confidence CFTR
interactors and discover a ∆F508 deletion-specific interactome, which is
extensively remodelled upon rescue. Detailed analysis of the interactome
remodelling identifies key novel interactors, whose loss promote ∆F508 CFTR
channel function in primary cystic fibrosis epithelia or which are critical for
CFTR biogenesis. Our results demonstrate that global remodelling of ∆F508 CFTR
interactions is crucial for rescue, and provide comprehensive insight into the
molecular disease mechanisms of cystic fibrosis caused by deletion of F508.

Nitrification is a two-step process where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and/or archaea, and subsequently to nitrate by
nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. Already described by Winogradsky in 1890, this
division of labour between the two functional groups is a generally accepted
characteristic of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Complete oxidation of
ammonia to nitrate in one organism (complete ammonia oxidation; comammox) is
energetically feasible, and it was postulated that this process could occur under
conditions selecting for species with lower growth rates but higher growth yields
than canonical ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Still, organisms catalysing this
process have not yet been discovered. Here we report the enrichment and initial
characterization of two Nitrospira species that encode all the enzymes necessary 
for ammonia oxidation via nitrite to nitrate in their genomes, and indeed
completely oxidize ammonium to nitrate to conserve energy. Their ammonia
monooxygenase (AMO) enzymes are phylogenetically distinct from currently
identified AMOs, rendering recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from
known ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms unlikely. We also found highly similar
amoA sequences (encoding the AMO subunit A) in public sequence databases, which
were apparently misclassified as methane monooxygenases. This recognition of a
novel amoA sequence group will lead to an improved understanding of the
environmental abundance and distribution of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms.
Furthermore, the discovery of the long-sought-after comammox process will change 
our perception of the nitrogen cycle.

Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been
considered to be a two-step process catalysed by chemolithoautotrophic
microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia or nitrite. No known nitrifier carries
out both steps, although complete nitrification should be energetically
advantageous. This functional separation has puzzled microbiologists for a
century. Here we report on the discovery and cultivation of a completely
nitrifying bacterium from the genus Nitrospira, a globally distributed group of
nitrite oxidizers. The genome of this chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes the 
pathways both for ammonia and nitrite oxidation, which are concomitantly
activated during growth by ammonia oxidation to nitrate. Genes affiliated with
the phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine
dehydrogenase genes of Nitrospira are present in many environments and were
retrieved on Nitrospira-contigs in new metagenomes from engineered systems. These
findings fundamentally change our picture of nitrification and point to
completely nitrifying Nitrospira as key components of nitrogen-cycling microbial 
communities.

Ancient DNA makes it possible to observe natural selection directly by analysing 
samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we
report a genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the
largest ancient DNA data set yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians who lived between 
6500 and 300 bc, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include,
to our knowledge, the first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic
farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones, and
who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europe's first 
farmers. We also report a transect of the steppe region in Samara between 5600
and 300 bc, which allows us to identify admixture into the steppe from at least
two external sources. We detect selection at loci associated with diet,
pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height.

Recent concern over global pollinator declines has led to considerable research
on the effects of pesticides on bees. Although pesticides are typically not
encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating
that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees,
affecting their foraging behaviour, homing ability and reproductive success. Bees
are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of 
wild flowering plants, but until now research on pesticide effects has been
limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services 
they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide
exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop
of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid
pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen
less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples
containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services.
Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to
pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to
effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can
impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important
implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the
functioning of natural ecosystems.

The response of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) to changes in temperature during
the twentieth century remains contentious, largely owing to difficulties in
estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of ice mass changes before 1992,
when Greenland-wide observations first became available. The only previous
estimates of change during the twentieth century are based on empirical modelling
and energy balance modelling. Consequently, no observation-based estimates of the
contribution from the GIS to the global-mean sea level budget before 1990 are
included in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. Here we calculate spatial ice mass loss around the entire GIS from 1900
to the present using aerial imagery from the 1980s. This allows accurate
high-resolution mapping of geomorphic features related to the maximum extent of
the GIS during the Little Ice Age at the end of the nineteenth century. We
estimate the total ice mass loss and its spatial distribution for three periods: 
1900-1983 (75.1 ± 29.4 gigatonnes per year), 1983-2003 (73.8 ± 40.5 gigatonnes
per year), and 2003-2010 (186.4 ± 18.9 gigatonnes per year). Furthermore, using
two surface mass balance models we partition the mass balance into a term for
surface mass balance (that is, total precipitation minus total sublimation minus 
runoff) and a dynamic term. We find that many areas currently undergoing change
are identical to those that experienced considerable thinning throughout the
twentieth century. We also reveal that the surface mass balance term shows a
considerable decrease since 2003, whereas the dynamic term is constant over the
past 110 years. Overall, our observation-based findings show that during the
twentieth century the GIS contributed at least 25.0 ± 9.4 millimetres of
global-mean sea level rise. Our result will help to close the twentieth-century
sea level budget, which remains crucial for evaluating the reliability of models 
used to predict global sea level rise.

Entanglement is one of the most fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, and 
is the key resource for quantum information processing (QIP). Bipartite entangled
states of identical particles have been generated and studied in several
experiments, and post-selected or heralded entangled states involving pairs of
photons, single photons and single atoms, or different nuclei in the solid state,
have also been produced. Here we use a deterministic quantum logic gate to
generate a 'hybrid' entangled state of two trapped-ion qubits held in different
isotopes of calcium, perform full tomography of the state produced, and make a
test of Bell's inequality with non-identical atoms. We use a laser-driven
two-qubit gate, whose mechanism is insensitive to the qubits' energy splittings, 
to produce a maximally entangled state of one (40)Ca(+) qubit and one (43)Ca(+)
qubit, held 3.5 micrometres apart in the same ion trap, with 99.8 ± 0.6 per cent 
fidelity. We test the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) version of Bell's
inequality for this novel entangled state and find that it is violated by 15
standard deviations; in this test, we close the detection loophole but not the
locality loophole. Mixed-species quantum logic is a powerful technique for the
construction of a quantum computer based on trapped ions, as it allows protection
of memory qubits while other qubits undergo logic operations or are used as
photonic interfaces to other processing units. The entangling gate mechanism used
here can also be applied to qubits stored in different atomic elements; this
would allow both memory and logic gate errors caused by photon scattering to be
reduced below the levels required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction,
which is an essential prerequisite for general-purpose quantum computing.

Precision control over hybrid physical systems at the quantum level is important 
for the realization of many quantum-based technologies. In the field of quantum
information processing (QIP) and quantum networking, various proposals discuss
the possibility of hybrid architectures where specific tasks are delegated to the
most suitable subsystem. For example, in quantum networks, it may be advantageous
to transfer information from a subsystem that has good memory properties to
another subsystem that is more efficient at transporting information between
nodes in the network. For trapped ions, a hybrid system formed of different
species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be exploited to expand and
refine the control of the system. Ions of different elements have previously been
used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling, creation of entanglement through
dissipation, and quantum non-demolition measurement of one species with another. 
Here we demonstrate an entangling quantum gate between ions of different elements
which can serve as an important building block of QIP, quantum networking,
precision spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum simulation. A geometric phase gate
between a (9)Be(+) ion and a (25)Mg(+) ion is realized through an effective
spin-spin interaction generated by state-dependent forces induced with laser
beams. Combined with single-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this
mixed-element entangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid
system for universal QIP. Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a CNOT
(controlled-NOT) gate and a SWAP gate. We further demonstrate the robustness of
these gates against thermal excitation and show improved detection in quantum
logic spectroscopy. We also observe a strong violation of a CHSH
(Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt)-type Bell inequality on entangled states composed of
different ion species.

The fossil record provides striking case studies of biodiversity loss and global 
ecosystem upheaval. Because of this, many studies have sought to assess the
magnitude of the current biodiversity crisis relative to past crises-a task
greatly complicated by the need to extrapolate extinction rates. Here we
challenge this approach by showing that the rarity of previously abundant taxa
may be more important than extinction in the cascade of events leading to global 
changes in the biosphere. Mass rarity may provide the most robust measure of our 
current biodiversity crisis relative to those past, and new insights into the
dynamics of mass extinction.

Despite progress in the development of drugs that efficiently target cancer
cells, treatments for metastatic tumours are often ineffective. The now
well-established dependency of cancer cells on their microenvironment suggests
that targeting the non-cancer-cell component of the tumour might form a basis for
the development of novel therapeutic approaches. However, the as-yet poorly
characterized contribution of host responses during tumour growth and metastatic 
progression represents a limitation to exploiting this approach. Here we identify
neutrophils as the main component and driver of metastatic establishment within
the (pre-)metastatic lung microenvironment in mouse breast cancer models.
Neutrophils have a fundamental role in inflammatory responses and their
contribution to tumorigenesis is still controversial. Using various strategies to
block neutrophil recruitment to the pre-metastatic site, we demonstrate that
neutrophils specifically support metastatic initiation. Importantly, we find that
neutrophil-derived leukotrienes aid the colonization of distant tissues by
selectively expanding the sub-pool of cancer cells that retain high tumorigenic
potential. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the leukotriene-generating
enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) abrogates neutrophil pro-metastatic
activity and consequently reduces metastasis. Our results reveal the efficacy of 
using targeted therapy against a specific tumour microenvironment component and
indicate that neutrophil Alox5 inhibition may limit metastatic progression.

Revealing the chemical and physical mechanisms underlying symmetry breaking and
shape transformations is key to understanding morphogenesis. If we are to
synthesize artificial structures with similar control and complexity to
biological systems, we need energy- and material-efficient bottom-up processes to
create building blocks of various shapes that can further assemble into
hierarchical structures. Lithographic top-down processing allows a high level of 
structural control in microparticle production but at the expense of limited
productivity. Conversely, bottom-up particle syntheses have higher material and
energy efficiency, but are more limited in the shapes achievable. Linear
hydrocarbons are known to pass through a series of metastable plastic rotator
phases before freezing. Here we show that by using appropriate cooling protocols,
we can harness these phase transitions to control the deformation of liquid
hydrocarbon droplets and then freeze them into solid particles, permanently
preserving their shape. Upon cooling, the droplets spontaneously break their
shape symmetry several times, morphing through a series of complex regular shapes
owing to the internal phase-transition processes. In this way we produce
particles including micrometre-sized octahedra, various polygonal platelets,
O-shapes, and fibres of submicrometre diameter, which can be selectively frozen
into the corresponding solid particles. This mechanism offers insights into
achieving complex morphogenesis from a system with a minimal number of molecular 
components.

Rapid and reversible manipulations of neural activity in behaving animals are
transforming our understanding of brain function. An important assumption
underlying much of this work is that evoked behavioural changes reflect the
function of the manipulated circuits. We show that this assumption is problematic
because it disregards indirect effects on the independent functions of downstream
circuits. Transient inactivations of motor cortex in rats and nucleus interface
(Nif) in songbirds severely degraded task-specific movement patterns and
courtship songs, respectively, which are learned skills that recover
spontaneously after permanent lesions of the same areas. We resolve this
discrepancy in songbirds, showing that Nif silencing acutely affects the function
of HVC, a downstream song control nucleus. Paralleling song recovery, the
off-target effects resolved within days of Nif lesions, a recovery consistent
with homeostatic regulation of neural activity in HVC. These results have
implications for interpreting transient circuit manipulations and for
understanding recovery after brain lesions.

DNA repair by homologous recombination is highly suppressed in G1 cells to ensure
that mitotic recombination occurs solely between sister chromatids. Although many
homologous recombination factors are cell-cycle regulated, the identity of the
events that are both necessary and sufficient to suppress recombination in G1
cells is unknown. Here we report that the cell cycle controls the interaction of 
BRCA1 with PALB2-BRCA2 to constrain BRCA2 function to the S/G2 phases in human
cells. We found that the BRCA1-interaction site on PALB2 is targeted by an E3
ubiquitin ligase composed of KEAP1, a PALB2-interacting protein, in complex with 
cullin-3 (CUL3)-RBX1 (ref. 6). PALB2 ubiquitylation suppresses its interaction
with BRCA1 and is counteracted by the deubiquitylase USP11, which is itself under
cell cycle control. Restoration of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction combined with the 
activation of DNA-end resection is sufficient to induce homologous recombination 
in G1, as measured by RAD51 recruitment, unscheduled DNA synthesis and a
CRISPR-Cas9-based gene-targeting assay. We conclude that the mechanism
prohibiting homologous recombination in G1 minimally consists of the suppression 
of DNA-end resection coupled with a multi-step block of the recruitment of BRCA2 
to DNA damage sites that involves the inhibition of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex
assembly. We speculate that the ability to induce homologous recombination in G1 
cells with defined factors could spur the development of gene-targeting
applications in non-dividing cells.

Inactivation of the TNFAIP3 gene, encoding the A20 protein, is associated with
critical inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis
and Crohn's disease. However, the role of A20 in attenuating inflammatory
signalling is unclear owing to paradoxical in vitro and in vivo findings. Here we
utilize genetically engineered mice bearing mutations in the A20 ovarian tumour
(OTU)-type deubiquitinase domain or in the zinc finger-4 (ZnF4) ubiquitin-binding
motif to investigate these discrepancies. We find that phosphorylation of A20
promotes cleavage of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the OTU domain and
enhances ZnF4-mediated substrate ubiquitination. Additionally, levels of linear
ubiquitination dictate whether A20-deficient cells die in response to tumour
necrosis factor. Mechanistically, linear ubiquitin chains preserve the
architecture of the TNFR1 signalling complex by blocking A20-mediated disassembly
of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin scaffolds. Collectively, our studies reveal
molecular mechanisms whereby A20 deubiquitinase activity and ubiquitin binding,
linear ubiquitination, and cellular kinases cooperate to regulate inflammation
and cell death.

The reactive species of oxygen and chlorine damage cellular components,
potentially leading to cell death. In proteins, the sulfur-containing amino acid 
methionine is converted to methionine sulfoxide, which can cause a loss of
biological activity. To rescue proteins with methionine sulfoxide residues,
living cells express methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) in most subcellular
compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we
report the identification of an enzymatic system, MsrPQ, repairing proteins
containing methionine sulfoxide in the bacterial cell envelope, a compartment
particularly exposed to the reactive species of oxygen and chlorine generated by 
the host defence mechanisms. MsrP, a molybdo-enzyme, and MsrQ, a haem-binding
membrane protein, are widely conserved throughout Gram-negative bacteria,
including major human pathogens. MsrPQ synthesis is induced by hypochlorous acid,
a powerful antimicrobial released by neutrophils. Consistently, MsrPQ is
essential for the maintenance of envelope integrity under bleach stress, rescuing
a wide series of structurally unrelated periplasmic proteins from methionine
oxidation, including the primary periplasmic chaperone SurA. For this activity,
MsrPQ uses electrons from the respiratory chain, which represents a novel
mechanism to import reducing equivalents into the bacterial cell envelope. A
remarkable feature of MsrPQ is its capacity to reduce both rectus (R-) and
sinister (S-) diastereoisomers of methionine sulfoxide, making this
oxidoreductase complex functionally different from previously identified Msrs.
The discovery that a large class of bacteria contain a single, non-stereospecific
enzymatic complex fully protecting methionine residues from oxidation should
prompt a search for similar systems in eukaryotic subcellular oxidizing
compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum.

Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance
to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording,
near-field thermophotovoltaics and lithography. Although experimental advances
have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small
as 20-30 nanometres (refs 4-6), quantitative analysis in the extreme near field
(less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges.
Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements differed from theoretical
predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes
with embedded thermocouples, in conjunction with new microdevices capable of
periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps 
as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen
metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling
direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon
nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked,
gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our
state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the
theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent
agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that
confirms the validity of this theory for modelling radiative heat transfer in
gaps as small as a few nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for
the rational design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat 
transfer.

The negative effect of increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution on grassland
biodiversity is now incontrovertible. However, the recent introduction of cleaner
technologies in the UK has led to reductions in the emissions of nitrogen oxides,
with concomitant decreases in N deposition. The degree to which grassland
biodiversity can be expected to 'bounce back' in response to these improvements
in air quality is uncertain, with a suggestion that long-term chronic N addition 
may lead to an alternative low biodiversity state. Here we present evidence from 
the 160-year-old Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK, that shows a
positive response of biodiversity to reducing N addition from either atmospheric 
pollution or fertilizers. The proportion of legumes, species richness and
diversity increased across the experiment between 1991 and 2012 as both wet and
dry N deposition declined. Plots that stopped receiving inorganic N fertilizer in
1989 recovered much of the diversity that had been lost, especially if limed.
There was no evidence that chronic N addition has resulted in an alternative low 
biodiversity state on the Park Grass plots, except where there has been extreme
acidification, although it is likely that the recovery of plant communities has
been facilitated by the twice-yearly mowing and removal of biomass. This may also
explain why a comparable response of plant communities to reduced N inputs has
yet to be observed in the wider landscape.

Roots and leaves of healthy plants host taxonomically structured bacterial
assemblies, and members of these communities contribute to plant growth and
health. We established Arabidopsis leaf- and root-derived microbiota culture
collections representing the majority of bacterial species that are reproducibly 
detectable by culture-independent community sequencing. We found an extensive
taxonomic overlap between the leaf and root microbiota. Genome drafts of 400
isolates revealed a large overlap of genome-encoded functional capabilities
between leaf- and root-derived bacteria with few significant differences at the
level of individual functional categories. Using defined bacterial communities
and a gnotobiotic Arabidopsis plant system we show that the isolates form
assemblies resembling natural microbiota on their cognate host organs, but are
also capable of ectopic leaf or root colonization. While this raises the
possibility of reciprocal relocation between root and leaf microbiota members,
genome information and recolonization experiments also provide evidence for
microbiota specialization to their respective niche.

Neural sequences are a fundamental feature of brain dynamics underlying diverse
behaviours, but the mechanisms by which they develop during learning remain
unknown. Songbirds learn vocalizations composed of syllables; in adult birds,
each syllable is produced by a different sequence of action potential bursts in
the premotor cortical area HVC. Here we carried out recordings of large
populations of HVC neurons in singing juvenile birds throughout learning to
examine the emergence of neural sequences. Early in vocal development, HVC
neurons begin producing rhythmic bursts, temporally locked to a 'prototype'
syllable. Different neurons are active at different latencies relative to
syllable onset to form a continuous sequence. Through development, as new
syllables emerge from the prototype syllable, initially highly overlapping burst 
sequences become increasingly distinct. We propose a mechanistic model in which
multiple neural sequences can emerge from the growth and splitting of a common
precursor sequence.

Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many high-energy astrophysical
systems, where instabilities can amplify the local magnetic field over very short
timescales. Specifically, the magnetorotational instability and dynamo action
have been suggested as a mechanism for the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic
fields (of 10(15) gauss and above) and for powering the explosion of a rotating
massive star. Such stars are candidate progenitors of type Ic-bl hypernovae,
which make up all supernovae that are connected to long γ-ray bursts. The
magnetorotational instability has been studied with local high-resolution
shearing-box simulations in three dimensions, and with global two-dimensional
simulations, but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this instability
can result in the creation of a large-scale, ordered and dynamically relevant
field. Here we report results from global, three-dimensional,
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. We show that
hydromagnetic turbulence in rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an
inverse cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal field that is 
consistent with the formation of bipolar magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our
results demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are plausible progenitors
for both type Ic-bl supernovae and long γ-ray bursts, and provide a viable
mechanism for the formation of magnetars. Moreover, our findings suggest that
rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind potentially magnetar-powered
superluminous supernovae.

Neuroblastoma is a paediatric malignancy that typically arises in early
childhood, and is derived from the developing sympathetic nervous system.
Clinical phenotypes range from localized tumours with excellent outcomes to
widely metastatic disease in which long-term survival is approximately 40%
despite intensive therapy. A previous genome-wide association study identified
common polymorphisms at the LMO1 gene locus that are highly associated with
neuroblastoma susceptibility and oncogenic addiction to LMO1 in the tumour cells.
Here we investigate the causal DNA variant at this locus and the mechanism by
which it leads to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. We first imputed all possible
genotypes across the LMO1 locus and then mapped highly associated single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) to areas of chromatin accessibility, evolutionary 
conservation and transcription factor binding sites. We show that SNP rs2168101
G>T is the most highly associated variant (combined P = 7.47 × 10(-29), odds
ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.70), and resides in a super-enhancer
defined by extensive acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 within the first intron 
of LMO1. The ancestral G allele that is associated with tumour formation resides 
in a conserved GATA transcription factor binding motif. We show that the newly
evolved protective TATA allele is associated with decreased total LMO1 expression
(P = 0.028) in neuroblastoma primary tumours, and ablates GATA3 binding
(P < 0.0001). We demonstrate allelic imbalance favouring the G-containing strand 
in tumours heterozygous for this SNP, as demonstrated both by RNA sequencing
(P < 0.0001) and reporter assays (P = 0.002). These findings indicate that a
recently evolved polymorphism within a super-enhancer element in the first intron
of LMO1 influences neuroblastoma susceptibility through differential GATA

Males and females share many traits that have a common genetic basis; however,
selection on these traits often differs between the sexes, leading to sexual
conflict. Under such sexual antagonism, theory predicts the evolution of genetic 
architectures that resolve this sexual conflict. Yet, despite intense theoretical
and empirical interest, the specific loci underlying sexually antagonistic
phenotypes have rarely been identified, limiting our understanding of how sexual 
conflict impacts genome evolution and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Here 
we identify a large effect locus controlling age at maturity in Atlantic salmon
(Salmo salar), an important fitness trait in which selection favours earlier
maturation in males than females, and show it is a clear example of sex-dependent
dominance that reduces intralocus sexual conflict and maintains adaptive
variation in wild populations. Using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism 
data across 57 wild populations and whole genome re-sequencing, we find that the 
vestigial-like family member 3 gene (VGLL3) exhibits sex-dependent dominance in
salmon, promoting earlier and later maturation in males and females,
respectively. VGLL3, an adiposity regulator associated with size and age at
maturity in humans, explained 39% of phenotypic variation, an unexpectedly large 
proportion for what is usually considered a highly polygenic trait. Such large
effects are predicted under balancing selection from either sexually antagonistic
or spatially varying selection. Our results provide the first empirical example
of dominance reversal allowing greater optimization of phenotypes within each
sex, contributing to the resolution of sexual conflict in a major and widespread 
evolutionary trade-off between age and size at maturity. They also provide key
empirical evidence for how variation in reproductive strategies can be maintained
over large geographical scales. We anticipate these findings will have a
substantial impact on population management in a range of harvested species where
trends towards earlier maturation have been observed.

During asymmetric division, fate determinants at the cell cortex segregate
unequally into the two daughter cells. It has recently been shown that Sara (Smad
anchor for receptor activation) signalling endosomes in the cytoplasm also
segregate asymmetrically during asymmetric division. Biased dispatch of Sara
endosomes mediates asymmetric Notch/Delta signalling during the asymmetric
division of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila. In flies, this has been
generalized to stem cells in the gut and the central nervous system, and, in
zebrafish, to neural precursors of the spinal cord. However, the mechanism of
asymmetric endosome segregation is not understood. Here we show that the plus-end
kinesin motor Klp98A targets Sara endosomes to the central spindle, where they
move bidirectionally on an antiparallel array of microtubules. The microtubule
depolymerizing kinesin Klp10A and its antagonist Patronin generate central
spindle asymmetry. This asymmetric spindle, in turn, polarizes endosome motility,
ultimately causing asymmetric endosome dispatch into one daughter cell. We
demonstrate this mechanism by inverting the polarity of the central spindle by
polar targeting of Patronin using nanobodies (single-domain antibodies). This
spindle inversion targets the endosomes to the wrong cell. Our data uncover the
molecular and physical mechanism by which organelles localized away from the
cellular cortex can be dispatched asymmetrically during asymmetric division.

Determination of the frictional properties of rocks is crucial for an
understanding of earthquake mechanics, because most earthquakes are caused by
frictional sliding along faults. Prior studies using rotary shear apparatus
revealed a marked decrease in frictional strength, which can cause a large stress
drop and strong shaking, with increasing slip rate and increasing work rate. (The
mechanical work rate per unit area equals the product of the shear stress and the
slip rate.) However, those important findings were obtained in experiments using 
rock specimens with dimensions of only several centimetres, which are much
smaller than the dimensions of a natural fault (of the order of 1,000 metres).
Here we use a large-scale biaxial friction apparatus with metre-sized rock
specimens to investigate scale-dependent rock friction. The experiments show that
rock friction in metre-sized rock specimens starts to decrease at a work rate
that is one order of magnitude smaller than that in centimetre-sized rock
specimens. Mechanical, visual and material observations suggest that slip-evolved
stress heterogeneity on the fault accounts for the difference. On the basis of
these observations, we propose that stress-concentrated areas exist in which
frictional slip produces more wear materials (gouge) than in areas outside,
resulting in further stress concentrations at these areas. Shear stress on the
fault is primarily sustained by stress-concentrated areas that undergo a high
work rate, so those areas should weaken rapidly and cause the macroscopic
frictional strength to decrease abruptly. To verify this idea, we conducted
numerical simulations assuming that local friction follows the frictional
properties observed on centimetre-sized rock specimens. The simulations
reproduced the macroscopic frictional properties observed on the metre-sized rock
specimens. Given that localized stress concentrations commonly occur naturally,
our results suggest that a natural fault may lose its strength faster than would 
be expected from the properties estimated from centimetre-sized rock samples.

Intensification of the hydrologic cycle is a key dimension of climate change,
with substantial impacts on human and natural systems. A basic measure of
hydrologic cycle intensification is the increase in global-mean precipitation per
unit surface warming, which varies by a factor of three in current-generation
climate models (about 1-3 per cent per kelvin). Part of the uncertainty may
originate from atmosphere-radiation interactions. As the climate warms, increases
in shortwave absorption from atmospheric moistening will suppress the
precipitation increase. This occurs through a reduction of the latent heating
increase required to maintain a balanced atmospheric energy budget. Using an
ensemble of climate models, here we show that such models tend to underestimate
the sensitivity of solar absorption to variations in atmospheric water vapour,
leading to an underestimation in the shortwave absorption increase and an
overestimation in the precipitation increase. This sensitivity also varies
considerably among models due to differences in radiative transfer
parameterizations, explaining a substantial portion of model spread in the
precipitation response. Consequently, attaining accurate shortwave absorption
responses through improvements to the radiative transfer schemes could reduce the
spread in the predicted global precipitation increase per degree warming for the 
end of the twenty-first century by about 35 per cent, and reduce the estimated
ensemble-mean increase in this quantity by almost 40 per cent.

The ability to control nanoscale features precisely is increasingly being
exploited to develop and improve monofunctional catalysts. Striking effects might
also be expected in the case of bifunctional catalysts, which are important in
the hydrocracking of fossil and renewable hydrocarbon sources to provide
high-quality diesel fuel. Such bifunctional hydrocracking catalysts contain metal
sites and acid sites, and for more than 50 years the so-called intimacy criterion
has dictated the maximum distance between the two types of site, beyond which
catalytic activity decreases. A lack of synthesis and material-characterization
methods with nanometre precision has long prevented in-depth exploration of the
intimacy criterion, which has often been interpreted simply as 'the closer the
better' for positioning metal and acid sites. Here we show for a bifunctional
catalyst--comprising an intimate mixture of zeolite Y and alumina binder, and
with platinum metal controllably deposited on either the zeolite or the
binder--that closest proximity between metal and zeolite acid sites can be
detrimental. Specifically, the selectivity when cracking large hydrocarbon
feedstock molecules for high-quality diesel production is optimized with the
catalyst that contains platinum on the binder, that is, with a nanoscale rather
than closest intimacy of the metal and acid sites. Thus, cracking of the large
and complex hydrocarbon molecules that are typically derived from alternative
sources, such as gas-to-liquid technology, vegetable oil or algal oil, should
benefit especially from bifunctional catalysts that avoid locating platinum on
the zeolite (the traditionally assumed optimal location). More generally, we
anticipate that the ability demonstrated here to spatially organize different
active sites at the nanoscale will benefit the further development and
optimization of the emerging generation of multifunctional catalysts.

Studies of the dwarf planet (1) Ceres using ground-based and orbiting telescopes 
have concluded that its closest meteoritic analogues are the volatile-rich CI and
CM carbonaceous chondrites. Water in clay minerals, ammoniated phyllosilicates,
or a mixture of Mg(OH)2 (brucite), Mg2CO3 and iron-rich serpentine have all been 
proposed to exist on the surface. In particular, brucite has been suggested from 
analysis of the mid-infrared spectrum of Ceres. But the lack of spectral data
across telluric absorption bands in the wavelength region 2.5 to 2.9
micrometres--where the OH stretching vibration and the H2O bending overtone are
found--has precluded definitive identifications. In addition, water vapour around
Ceres has recently been reported, possibly originating from localized sources.
Here we report spectra of Ceres from 0.4 to 5 micrometres acquired at distances
from ~82,000 to 4,300 kilometres from the surface. Our measurements indicate
widespread ammoniated phyllosilicates across the surface, but no detectable water
ice. Ammonia, accreted either as organic matter or as ice, may have reacted with 
phyllosilicates on Ceres during differentiation. This suggests that material from
the outer Solar System was incorporated into Ceres, either during its formation
at great heliocentric distance or by incorporation of material transported into
the main asteroid belt.

The dwarf planet (1) Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt with a
mean diameter of about 950 kilometres, is located at a mean distance from the Sun
of about 2.8 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun
distance). Thermal evolution models suggest that it is a differentiated body with
potential geological activity. Unlike on the icy satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn, where tidal forces are responsible for spewing briny water into space, no
tidal forces are acting on Ceres. In the absence of such forces, most objects in 
the main asteroid belt are expected to be geologically inert. The recent
discovery of water vapour absorption near Ceres and previous detection of bound
water and OH near and on Ceres (refs 5-7) have raised interest in the possible
presence of surface ice. Here we report the presence of localized bright areas on
Ceres from an orbiting imager. These unusual areas are consistent with hydrated
magnesium sulfates mixed with dark background material, although other
compositions are possible. Of particular interest is a bright pit on the floor of
crater Occator that exhibits probable sublimation of water ice, producing haze
clouds inside the crater that appear and disappear with a diurnal rhythm.
Slow-moving condensed-ice or dust particles may explain this haze. We conclude
that Ceres must have accreted material from beyond the 'snow line', which is the 
distance from the Sun at which water molecules condense.

Cellular differentiation involves profound remodelling of chromatic landscapes,
yet the mechanisms by which somatic cell identity is subsequently maintained
remain incompletely understood. To further elucidate regulatory pathways that
safeguard the somatic state, we performed two comprehensive RNA interference
(RNAi) screens targeting chromatin factors during transcription-factor-mediated
reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells).
Subunits of the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) complex, including Chaf1a and
Chaf1b, emerged as the most prominent hits from both screens, followed by
modulators of lysine sumoylation and heterochromatin maintenance. Optimal
modulation of both CAF-1 and transcription factor levels increased reprogramming 
efficiency by several orders of magnitude and facilitated iPS cell formation in
as little as 4 days. Mechanistically, CAF-1 suppression led to a more accessible 
chromatin structure at enhancer elements early during reprogramming. These
changes were accompanied by a decrease in somatic heterochromatin domains,
increased binding of Sox2 to pluripotency-specific targets and activation of
associated genes. Notably, suppression of CAF-1 also enhanced the direct
conversion of B cells into macrophages and fibroblasts into neurons. Together,
our findings reveal the histone chaperone CAF-1 to be a novel regulator of
somatic cell identity during transcription-factor-induced cell-fate transitions
and provide a potential strategy to modulate cellular plasticity in a
regenerative setting.

The spectral gap--the energy difference between the ground state and first
excited state of a system--is central to quantum many-body physics. Many
challenging open problems, such as the Haldane conjecture, the question of the
existence of gapped topological spin liquid phases, and the Yang-Mills gap
conjecture, concern spectral gaps. These and other problems are particular cases 
of the general spectral gap problem: given the Hamiltonian of a quantum many-body
system, is it gapped or gapless? Here we prove that this is an undecidable
problem. Specifically, we construct families of quantum spin systems on a
two-dimensional lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour
interactions, for which the spectral gap problem is undecidable. This result
extends to undecidability of other low-energy properties, such as the existence
of algebraically decaying ground-state correlations. The proof combines
Hamiltonian complexity techniques with aperiodic tilings, to construct a
Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the evolution of a quantum
phase-estimation algorithm followed by a universal Turing machine. The spectral
gap depends on the outcome of the corresponding 'halting problem'. Our result
implies that there exists no algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary model is
gapped or gapless, and that there exist models for which the presence or absence 
of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms of mathematics.

Most human breast cancers have diversified genomically and biologically by the
time they become clinically evident. Early events involved in their genesis and
the cellular context in which these events occur have thus been difficult to
characterize. Here we present the first formal evidence of the shared and
independent ability of basal cells and luminal progenitors, isolated from normal 
human mammary tissue and transduced with a single oncogene (KRAS(G12D)), to
produce serially transplantable, polyclonal, invasive ductal carcinomas within 8 
weeks of being introduced either subrenally or subcutaneously into
immunodeficient mice. DNA barcoding of the initial cells revealed a dramatic
change in the numbers and sizes of clones generated from them within 2 weeks, and
the first appearance of many 'new' clones in tumours passaged into secondary
recipients. Both primary and secondary tumours were phenotypically heterogeneous 
and primary tumours were categorized transcriptionally as 'normal-like'. This
system challenges previous concepts that carcinogenesis in normal human epithelia
is necessarily a slow process requiring the acquisition of multiple driver
mutations. It also presents the first description of initial events that
accompany the genesis and evolution of malignant human mammary cell populations, 
thereby contributing new understanding of the rapidity with which heterogeneity
in their properties can develop.

Oncogene-induced DNA replication stress has been implicated as a driver of
tumorigenesis. Many chromosomal rearrangements characteristic of human cancers
originate from specific regions of the genome called common fragile sites (CFSs).
CFSs are difficult-to-replicate loci that manifest as gaps or breaks on metaphase
chromosomes (termed CFS 'expression'), particularly when cells have been exposed 
to replicative stress. The MUS81-EME1 structure-specific endonuclease promotes
the appearance of chromosome gaps or breaks at CFSs following replicative stress.
Here we show that entry of cells into mitotic prophase triggers the recruitment
of MUS81 to CFSs. The nuclease activity of MUS81 then promotes POLD3-dependent
DNA synthesis at CFSs, which serves to minimize chromosome mis-segregation and
non-disjunction. We propose that the attempted condensation of incompletely
duplicated loci in early mitosis serves as the trigger for completion of DNA
replication at CFS loci in human cells. Given that this POLD3-dependent mitotic
DNA synthesis is enhanced in aneuploid cancer cells that exhibit intrinsically
high levels of chromosomal instability (CIN(+)) and replicative stress, we
suggest that targeting this pathway could represent a new therapeutic approach.

In recent years, several associations between common chronic human disorders and 
altered gut microbiome composition and function have been reported. In most of
these reports, treatment regimens were not controlled for and conclusions could
thus be confounded by the effects of various drugs on the microbiota, which may
obscure microbial causes, protective factors or diagnostically relevant signals. 
Our study addresses disease and drug signatures in the human gut microbiome of
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Two previous quantitative gut metagenomics
studies of T2D patients that were unstratified for treatment yielded divergent
conclusions regarding its associated gut microbial dysbiosis. Here we show, using
784 available human gut metagenomes, how antidiabetic medication confounds these 
results, and analyse in detail the effects of the most widely used antidiabetic
drug metformin. We provide support for microbial mediation of the therapeutic
effects of metformin through short-chain fatty acid production, as well as for
potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects 
in the form of a relative increase in abundance of Escherichia species.
Controlling for metformin treatment, we report a unified signature of gut
microbiome shifts in T2D with a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa. These in
turn cause functional microbiome shifts, in part alleviated by metformin-induced 
changes. Overall, the present study emphasizes the need to disentangle gut
microbiota signatures of specific human diseases from those of medication.

Somatic stem cells maintain tissue homeostasis by dynamically adjusting
proliferation and differentiation in response to stress and metabolic cues. Here 
we identify Ca(2+) signalling as a central regulator of intestinal stem cell
(ISC) activity in Drosophila. We show that dietary L-glutamate stimulates ISC
division and gut growth. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) is required 
in ISCs for this response, and for an associated modulation of cytosolic Ca(2+)
oscillations that results in sustained high cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations. High
cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations induce ISC proliferation by regulating
Calcineurin and CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activator (Crtc). In response
to a wide range of dietary and stress stimuli, ISCs reversibly transition between
Ca(2+) oscillation states that represent poised or activated modes of
proliferation, respectively. We propose that the dynamic regulation of
intracellular Ca(2+) levels allows effective integration of diverse mitogenic
signals in ISCs to adapt their proliferative activity to the needs of the tissue.

Transcription of genes encoding small structured RNAs such as transfer RNAs,
spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA and ribosomal 5S RNA is carried out by RNA
polymerase III (Pol III), the largest yet structurally least characterized
eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy
structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol III elongating complex at 3.9 Å
resolution and the apo Pol III enzyme in two different conformations at 4.6 and
4.7 Å resolution, respectively, which allow the building of a 17-subunit atomic
model of Pol III. The reconstructions reveal the precise orientation of the
C82-C34-C31 heterotrimer in close proximity to the stalk. The C53-C37 heterodimer
positions residues involved in transcription termination close to the
non-template DNA strand. In the apo Pol III structures, the stalk adopts
different orientations coupled with closed and open conformations of the clamp.
Our results provide novel insights into Pol III-specific transcription and the
adaptation of Pol III towards its small transcriptional targets.

FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg cells) prevent autoimmunity by limiting the
effector activity of T cells that have escaped thymic negative selection or
peripheral inactivation. Despite the information available about molecular
factors mediating the suppressive function of Treg cells, the relevant cellular
events in intact tissues remain largely unexplored, and whether Treg cells
prevent activation of self-specific T cells or primarily limit damage from such
cells has not been determined. Here we use multiplex, quantitative imaging in
mice to show that, within secondary lymphoid tissues, highly suppressive Treg
cells expressing phosphorylated STAT5 exist in discrete clusters with rare
IL-2-positive T cells that are activated by self-antigens. This local IL-2
induction of STAT5 phosphorylation in Treg cells is part of a feedback circuit
that limits further autoimmune responses. Inducible ablation of T cell receptor
expression by Treg cells reduces their regulatory capacity and disrupts their
localization in clusters, resulting in uncontrolled effector T cell responses.
Our data thus reveal that autoreactive T cells are activated to cytokine
production on a regular basis, with physically co-clustering T cell
receptor-stimulated Treg cells responding in a negative feedback manner to
suppress incipient autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis.

Skeletal growth relies on both biosynthetic and catabolic processes. While the
role of the former is clearly established, how the latter contributes to
growth-promoting pathways is less understood. Macroautophagy, hereafter referred 
to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that plays a fundamental part in tissue
homeostasis. We investigated the role of autophagy during bone growth, which is
mediated by chondrocyte rate of proliferation, hypertrophic differentiation and
extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in growth plates. Here we show that
autophagy is induced in growth-plate chondrocytes during post-natal development
and regulates the secretion of type II collagen (Col2), the major component of
cartilage ECM. Mice lacking the autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) in chondrocytes
experience endoplasmic reticulum storage of type II procollagen (PC2) and
defective formation of the Col2 fibrillary network in the ECM. Surprisingly,
post-natal induction of chondrocyte autophagy is mediated by the growth factor
FGF18 through FGFR4 and JNK-dependent activation of the autophagy initiation
complex VPS34-beclin-1. Autophagy is completely suppressed in growth plates from 
Fgf18(-/-) embryos, while Fgf18(+/-) heterozygous and Fgfr4(-/-) mice fail to
induce autophagy during post-natal development and show decreased Col2 levels in 
the growth plate. Strikingly, the Fgf18(+/-) and Fgfr4(-/-) phenotypes can be
rescued in vivo by pharmacological activation of autophagy, pointing to autophagy
as a novel effector of FGF signalling in bone. These data demonstrate that
autophagy is a developmentally regulated process necessary for bone growth, and
identify FGF signalling as a crucial regulator of autophagy in chondrocytes.

A sense of fairness plays a critical role in supporting human cooperation. Adult 
norms of fair resource sharing vary widely across societies, suggesting that
culture shapes the acquisition of fairness behaviour during childhood. Here we
examine how fairness behaviour develops in children from seven diverse societies,
testing children from 4 to 15 years of age (n = 866 pairs) in a standardized
resource decision task. We measured two key aspects of fairness decisions:
disadvantageous inequity aversion (peer receives more than self) and advantageous
inequity aversion (self receives more than a peer). We show that disadvantageous 
inequity aversion emerged across all populations by middle childhood. By
contrast, advantageous inequity aversion was more variable, emerging in three
populations and only later in development. We discuss these findings in relation 
to questions about the universality and cultural specificity of human fairness.

Contraction of both skeletal muscle and the heart is thought to be controlled by 
a calcium-dependent structural change in the actin-containing thin filaments,
which permits the binding of myosin motors from the neighbouring thick filaments 
to drive filament sliding. Here we show by synchrotron small-angle X-ray
diffraction of frog (Rana temporaria) single skeletal muscle cells that, although
the well-known thin-filament mechanism is sufficient for regulation of muscle
shortening against low load, force generation against high load requires a second
permissive step linked to a change in the structure of the thick filament. The
resting (switched 'OFF') structure of the thick filament is characterized by
helical tracks of myosin motors on the filament surface and a short backbone
periodicity. This OFF structure is almost completely preserved during low-load
shortening, which is driven by a small fraction of constitutively active
(switched 'ON') myosin motors outside thick-filament control. At higher load,
these motors generate sufficient thick-filament stress to trigger the transition 
to its long-periodicity ON structure, unlocking the major population of motors
required for high-load contraction. This concept of the thick filament as a
regulatory mechanosensor provides a novel explanation for the dynamic and
energetic properties of skeletal muscle. A similar mechanism probably operates in
the heart.

Mass-screen-and-treat and targeted mass-drug-administration strategies are being 
considered as a means to interrupt transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
However, the effectiveness of such strategies will depend on the extent to which 
current and future diagnostics are able to detect those individuals who are
infectious to mosquitoes. We estimate the relationship between parasite density
and onward infectivity using sensitive quantitative parasite diagnostics and
mosquito feeding assays from Burkina Faso. We find that a diagnostic with a lower
detection limit of 200 parasites per microlitre would detect 55% of the
infectious reservoir (the combined infectivity to mosquitoes of the whole
population weighted by how often each individual is bitten) whereas a test with a
limit of 20 parasites per microlitre would detect 83% and 2 parasites per
microlitre would detect 95% of the infectious reservoir. Using mathematical
models, we show that increasing the diagnostic sensitivity from 200 parasites per
microlitre (equivalent to microscopy or current rapid diagnostic tests) to 2
parasites per microlitre would increase the number of regions where transmission 
could be interrupted with a mass-screen-and-treat programme from an entomological
inoculation rate below 1 to one of up to 4. The higher sensitivity diagnostic
could reduce the number of treatment rounds required to interrupt transmission in
areas of lower prevalence. We predict that mass-screen-and-treat with a highly
sensitive diagnostic is less effective than mass drug administration owing to the
prophylactic protection provided to uninfected individuals by the latter
approach. In low-transmission settings such as those in Southeast Asia, we find
that a diagnostic tool with a sensitivity of 20 parasites per microlitre may be
sufficient for targeted mass drug administration because this diagnostic is
predicted to identify a similar village population prevalence compared with that 
currently detected using polymerase chain reaction if treatment levels are high
and screening is conducted during the dry season. Along with other factors, such 
as coverage, choice of drug, timing of the intervention, importation of
infections, and seasonality, the sensitivity of the diagnostic can play a part in
increasing the chance of interrupting transmission.

The global burden of malaria has been substantially reduced over the past two
decades. Future efforts to reduce malaria further will require moving beyond the 
treatment of clinical infections to targeting malaria transmission more broadly
in the community. As such, the accurate identification of asymptomatic human
infections, which can sustain a large proportion of transmission, is becoming a
vital component of control and elimination programmes. We determined the
relationship across common diagnostics used to measure malaria prevalence -
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), rapid diagnostic test and microscopy - for the
detection of Plasmodium falciparum infections in endemic populations based on a
pooled analysis of cross-sectional data. We included data from more than 170,000 
individuals comparing the detection by rapid diagnostic test and microscopy, and 
30,000 for detection by rapid diagnostic test and PCR. The analysis showed that, 
on average, rapid diagnostic tests detected 41% (95% confidence interval =
26-66%) of PCR-positive infections. Data for the comparison of rapid diagnostic
test to PCR detection at high transmission intensity and in adults were sparse.
Prevalence measured by rapid diagnostic test and microscopy was comparable,
although rapid diagnostic test detected slightly more infections than microscopy.
On average, microscopy captured 87% (95% confidence interval = 74-102%) of rapid 
diagnostic test-positive infections. The extent to which higher rapid diagnostic 
test detection reflects increased sensitivity, lack of specificity or both, is
unclear. Once the contribution of asymptomatic individuals to the infectious
reservoir is better defined, future analyses should ideally establish optimal
detection limits of new diagnostics for use in control and elimination
strategies.

treatment and prevention. However, despite high HIV burden in sub-Saharan Africa,
testing coverage is low, particularly among young adults and men. Community-based
HIV testing and counselling (testing outside of health facilities) has the
potential to reduce coverage gaps, but the relative impact of different
modalities is not well assessed. We conducted a systematic review of HIV testing 
modalities, characterizing community (home, mobile, index, key populations,
campaign, workplace and self-testing) and facility approaches by population
reached, HIV positivity, CD4 count at diagnosis and linkage. Of 2,520 abstracts
screened, 126 met eligibility criteria. Community HIV testing and counselling had
high coverage and uptake and identified HIV-positive people at higher CD4 counts 
than facility testing. Mobile HIV testing reached the highest proportion of men
of all modalities examined (50%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 47-54%) and home 
with self-testing reached the highest proportion of young adults (66%, 95% CI =
65-67%). Few studies evaluated HIV testing for key populations (commercial sex
workers and men who have sex with men), but these interventions yielded high HIV 
positivity (38%, 95% CI = 19-62%) combined with the highest proportion of
first-time testers (78%, 95% CI = 63-88%), indicating service gaps. Community
testing with facilitated linkage (for example, counsellor follow-up to support
linkage) achieved high linkage to care (95%, 95% CI = 87-98%) and antiretroviral 
initiation (75%, 95% CI = 68-82%). Expanding home and mobile testing,
self-testing and outreach to key populations with facilitated linkage can
increase the proportion of men, young adults and high-risk individuals linked to 
HIV treatment and prevention, and decrease HIV burden.

There are inefficiencies in current approaches to monitoring patients on
antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients typically attend clinics
every 1 to 3 months for clinical assessment. The clinic costs are comparable with
the costs of the drugs themselves and CD4 counts are measured every 6 months, but
patients are rarely switched to second-line therapies. To ensure sustainability
of treatment programmes, a transition to more cost-effective delivery of
antiretroviral therapy is needed. In contrast to the CD4 count, measurement of
the level of HIV RNA in plasma (the viral load) provides a direct measure of the 
current treatment effect. Viral-load-informed differentiated care is a means of
tailoring care so that those with suppressed viral load visit the clinic less
frequently and attention is focussed on those with unsuppressed viral load to
promote adherence and timely switching to a second-line regimen. The most
feasible approach to measuring viral load in many countries is to collect dried
blood spot samples for testing in regional laboratories; however, there have been
concerns over the sensitivity and specificity of this approach to define
treatment failure and the delay in returning results to the clinic. We use
modelling to synthesize evidence and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
viral-load-informed differentiated care, accounting for limitations of dried
blood sample testing. We find that viral-load-informed differentiated care using 
dried blood sample testing is cost-effective and is a recommended strategy for
patient monitoring, although further empirical evidence as the approach is rolled
out would be of value. We also explore the potential benefits of point-of-care
viral load tests that may become available in the future.

Tuberculosis is a major source of global mortality caused by infection, partly
because of a tremendous ongoing burden of undiagnosed disease. Improved
diagnostic technology may play an increasingly crucial part in global efforts to 
end tuberculosis, but the ability of diagnostic tests to curb tuberculosis
transmission is dependent on multiple factors, including the time taken by a
patient to seek health care, the patient's symptoms, and the patterns of
transmission before diagnosis. Novel diagnostic assays for tuberculosis have
conventionally been evaluated on the basis of characteristics such as sensitivity
and specificity, using assumptions that probably overestimate the impact of
diagnostic tests on transmission. We argue for a shift in focus to the evaluation
of such tests' incremental value, defining outcomes that reflect each test's
purpose (for example, transmissions averted) and comparing systems with the test 
against those without, in terms of those outcomes. Incremental value can also be 
measured in units of outcome per incremental unit of resource (for example, money
or human capacity). Using a novel, simplified model of tuberculosis transmission 
that addresses some of the limitations of earlier tuberculosis diagnostic models,
we demonstrate that the incremental value of any novel test depends not just on
its accuracy, but also on elements such as patient behaviour, tuberculosis
natural history and health systems. By integrating these factors into a single
unified framework, we advance an approach to the evaluation of new diagnostic
tests for tuberculosis that considers the incremental value at the population
level and demonstrates how additional data could inform more-effective
implementation of tuberculosis diagnostic tests under various conditions.

It is estimated that pneumonia is responsible for 15% of childhood deaths
worldwide. Recent research has shown that hypoxia and malnutrition are strong
predictors of mortality in children hospitalized for pneumonia. It is estimated
that 15% of children under 5 who are hospitalized for pneumonia have hypoxaemia
and that around 1.5 million children with severe pneumonia require oxygen
treatment each year. We developed a deterministic compartmental model that links 
the care pathway to disease progression to assess the impact of introducing pulse
oximetry as a prognostic tool to distinguish severe from non-severe pneumonia in 
under-5 year olds across 15 countries with the highest burden worldwide. We
estimate that, assuming access to supplemental oxygen, pulse oximetry has the
potential to avert up to 148,000 deaths if implemented across the 15 countries.
By contrast, integrated management of childhood illness alone has a relatively
small impact on mortality owing to its low sensitivity. Pulse oximetry can
significantly increase the incidence of correctly treated severe cases as well as
reduce the incidence of incorrect treatment with antibiotics. We also found that 
the combination of pulse oximetry with integrated management of childhood illness
is highly cost-effective, with median estimates ranging from US$2.97 to $52.92
per disability-adjusted life year averted in the 15 countries analysed. This
combination of substantial burden reduction and favourable cost-effectiveness
makes pulse oximetry a promising candidate for improving the prognosis for
children with pneumonia in resource-poor settings.

Ebola emerged in West Africa around December 2013 and swept through Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Liberia, giving rise to 27,748 confirmed, probable and suspected
cases reported by 29 July 2015. Case diagnoses during the epidemic have relied on
polymerase chain reaction-based tests. Owing to limited laboratory capacity and
local transport infrastructure, the delays from sample collection to test results
being available have often been 2 days or more. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic
tests offer the potential to substantially reduce these delays. We review Ebola
rapid diagnostic tests approved by the World Health Organization and those
currently in development. Such rapid diagnostic tests could allow early triaging 
of patients, thereby reducing the potential for nosocomial transmission. In
addition, despite the lower test accuracy, rapid diagnostic test-based diagnosis 
may be beneficial in some contexts because of the reduced time spent by
uninfected individuals in health-care settings where they may be at increased
risk of infection; this also frees up hospital beds. We use mathematical
modelling to explore the potential benefits of diagnostic testing strategies
involving rapid diagnostic tests alone and in combination with polymerase chain
reaction testing. Our analysis indicates that the use of rapid diagnostic tests
with sensitivity and specificity comparable with those currently under
development always enhances control, whether evaluated at a health-care-unit or
population level. If such tests had been available throughout the recent
epidemic, we estimate, for Sierra Leone, that their use in combination with
confirmatory polymerase chain-reaction testing might have reduced the scale of
the epidemic by over a third.

Countries in the Indian subcontinent have committed to reducing the incidence of 
kala-azar, a clinical manifestation of visceral leishmaniasis, to below 1 in
10,000 by 2020. We address the role of timing of use and accuracy of diagnostics 
in kala-azar control and elimination. We use empirical data on health-seeking
behaviour and health-system performance from the Indian state of Bihar,
Bangladesh and Nepal to parameterize a mathematical model. Diagnosis of cases is 
key to case management, control and surveillance. Treatment of cases prevents
onward transmission, and we show that the differences in time to diagnosis in
these three settings explain the observed differences in incidence. Shortening
the time from health-care seeking to diagnosis is likely to lead to dramatic
reductions in incidence in Bihar, bringing the incidence down to the levels seen 
in Bangladesh and Nepal. The results emphasize the importance of maintaining
population and health-system awareness, particularly as transmission and disease 
incidence decline. We explore the possibility of diagnosing patients before the
onset of clinical kala-azar (before 14 days fever), and show that this could have
a marked impact on incidence, even for a moderately sensitive test. However,
limited specificity (that results in false positives) is a major barrier to such 
a strategy. Diagnostic tests of high specificity used at an early stage of active
infection, even if sensitivity is only moderate, could have a key role in the
control of kala-azar, and prevent its resurgence when paired with the passive
health-care system and tests of high sensitivity, such as the test for rK39
antibody response.

Processes such as the scattering of alpha particles ((4)He), the triple-alpha
reaction, and alpha capture play a major role in stellar nucleosynthesis. In
particular, alpha capture on carbon determines the ratio of carbon to oxygen
during helium burning, and affects subsequent carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon
burning stages. It also substantially affects models of thermonuclear type Ia
supernovae, owing to carbon detonation in accreting carbon-oxygen white-dwarf
stars. In these reactions, the accurate calculation of the elastic scattering of 
alpha particles and alpha-like nuclei--nuclei with even and equal numbers of
protons and neutrons--is important for understanding background and resonant
scattering contributions. First-principles calculations of processes involving
alpha particles and alpha-like nuclei have so far been impractical, owing to the 
exponential growth of the number of computational operations with the number of
particles. Here we describe an ab initio calculation of alpha-alpha scattering
that uses lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We use lattice effective field theory 
to describe the low-energy interactions of protons and neutrons, and apply a
technique called the 'adiabatic projection method' to reduce the eight-body
system to a two-cluster system. We take advantage of the computational efficiency
and the more favourable scaling with system size of auxiliary-field Monte Carlo
simulations to compute an ab initio effective Hamiltonian for the two clusters.
We find promising agreement between lattice results and experimental phase shifts
for s-wave and d-wave scattering. The approximately quadratic scaling of
computational operations with particle number suggests that it should be possible
to compute alpha scattering and capture on carbon and oxygen in the near future. 
The methods described here can be applied to ultracold atomic few-body systems as
well as to hadronic systems using lattice quantum chromodynamics to describe the 
interactions of quarks and gluons.

Observations of the cosmic microwave background indicate that baryons account for
5 per cent of the Universe's total energy content. In the local Universe, the
census of all observed baryons falls short of this estimate by a factor of two.
Cosmological simulations indicate that the missing baryons have not condensed
into virialized haloes, but reside throughout the filaments of the cosmic web
(where matter density is larger than average) as a low-density plasma at
temperatures of 10(5)-10(7) kelvin, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium.
There have been previous claims of the detection of warm-hot baryons along the
line of sight to distant blazars and of hot gas between interacting clusters.
These observations were, however, unable to trace the large-scale filamentary
structure, or to estimate the total amount of warm-hot baryons in a
representative volume of the Universe. Here we report X-ray observations of
filamentary structures of gas at 10(7) kelvin associated with the galaxy cluster 
Abell 2744. Previous observations of this cluster were unable to resolve and
remove coincidental X-ray point sources. After subtracting these, we find hot gas
structures that are coherent over scales of 8 megaparsecs. The filaments coincide
with over-densities of galaxies and dark matter, with 5-10 per cent of their mass
in baryonic gas. This gas has been heated up by the cluster's gravitational pull 
and is now feeding its core. Our findings strengthen evidence for a picture of
the Universe in which a large fraction of the missing baryons reside in the
filaments of the cosmic web.

Overflow metabolism refers to the seemingly wasteful strategy in which cells use 
fermentation instead of the more efficient respiration to generate energy,
despite the availability of oxygen. Known as the Warburg effect in the context of
cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells,
including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained
unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in
Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to
cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis
under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource
allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and
accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the
model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by
fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein
abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.

Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It
describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of 
quantum information sciences. Entanglement is now being studied in diverse fields
ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. However, measuring entanglement
remains a challenge. This is especially so in systems of interacting delocalized 
particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement
has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant
particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Making use of our
single-site-resolved control of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we
prepare two identical copies of a many-body state and interfere them. This
enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Rényi entanglement entropy, and
mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to
characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly correlated many-body
systems.

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence
of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian
cells. Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling
is limited by the requirement of millions of cells. Here we report an
ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for
detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the
single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different
single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with
multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin 
regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS.
Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific
gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of
gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools
of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides
from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. 
Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically
involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one
mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular
thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53
and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion,
scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range
of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research,
and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.

T-cell receptor (TCR) signalling has a key role in determining T-cell fate.
Precursor cells expressing TCRs within a certain low-affinity range for complexes
of self-peptide and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) undergo positive
selection and differentiate into naive T cells expressing a highly diverse
self-MHC-restricted TCR repertoire. In contrast, precursors displaying TCRs with 
a high affinity for 'self' are either eliminated through TCR-agonist-induced
apoptosis (negative selection) or restrained by regulatory T (Treg) cells, whose 
differentiation and function are controlled by the X-chromosome-encoded
transcription factor Foxp3 (reviewed in ref. 2). Foxp3 is expressed in a fraction
of self-reactive T cells that escape negative selection in response to
agonist-driven TCR signals combined with interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor
signalling. In addition to Treg cells, TCR-agonist-driven selection results in
the generation of several other specialized T-cell lineages such as natural
killer T cells and innate mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Although the
latter exhibit a restricted TCR repertoire, Treg cells display a highly diverse
collection of TCRs. Here we explore in mice whether a specialized mechanism
enables agonist-driven selection of Treg cells with a diverse TCR repertoire, and
the importance this holds for self-tolerance. We show that the intronic Foxp3
enhancer conserved noncoding sequence 3 (CNS3) acts as an epigenetic switch that 
confers a poised state to the Foxp3 promoter in precursor cells to make Treg cell
lineage commitment responsive to a broad range of TCR stimuli, particularly to
suboptimal ones. CNS3-dependent expansion of the TCR repertoire enables Treg
cells to control self-reactive T cells effectively, especially when thymic
negative selection is genetically impaired. Our findings highlight the
complementary roles of these two main mechanisms of self-tolerance.

Copy number variations have been frequently associated with developmental delay, 
intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. MECP2 duplication syndrome
is one of the most common genomic rearrangements in males and is characterized by
autism, intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, anxiety, epilepsy, recurrent 
respiratory tract infections and early death. The broad range of deficits caused 
by methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) overexpression poses a daunting challenge
to traditional biochemical-pathway-based therapeutic approaches. Accordingly, we 
sought strategies that directly target MeCP2 and are amenable to translation into
clinical therapy. The first question that we addressed was whether the
neurological dysfunction is reversible after symptoms set in. Reversal of
phenotypes in adult symptomatic mice has been demonstrated in some models of
monogenic loss-of-function neurological disorders, including loss of MeCP2 in
Rett syndrome, indicating that, at least in some cases, the neuroanatomy may
remain sufficiently intact so that correction of the molecular dysfunction
underlying these disorders can restore healthy physiology. Given the absence of
neurodegeneration in MECP2 duplication syndrome, we propose that restoration of
normal MeCP2 levels in MECP2 duplication adult mice would rescue their phenotype.
By generating and characterizing a conditional Mecp2-overexpressing mouse model, 
here we show that correction of MeCP2 levels largely reverses the behavioural,
molecular and electrophysiological deficits. We also reduced MeCP2 using an
antisense oligonucleotide strategy, which has greater translational potential.
Antisense oligonucleotides are small, modified nucleic acids that can selectively
hybridize with messenger RNA transcribed from a target gene and silence it, and
have been successfully used to correct deficits in different mouse models. We
find that antisense oligonucleotide treatment induces a broad phenotypic rescue
in adult symptomatic transgenic MECP2 duplication mice (MECP2-TG), and corrected 
MECP2 levels in lymphoblastoid cells from MECP2 duplication patients in a
dose-dependent manner.

The formation of relativistic jets by an accreting compact object is one of the
fundamental mysteries of astrophysics. Although the theory is poorly understood, 
observations of relativistic jets from systems known as microquasars (compact
binary stars) have led to a well established phenomenology. Relativistic jets are
not expected to be produced by sources with soft or supersoft X-ray spectra,
although two such systems are known to produce relatively low-velocity bipolar
outflows. Here we report the optical spectra of an ultraluminous supersoft X-ray 
source (ULS) in the nearby galaxy M81 (M81 ULS-1; refs 9, 10). Unexpectedly, the 
spectra show blueshifted, broad Hα emission lines, characteristic of baryonic
jets with relativistic speeds. These time-variable emission lines have projected 
velocities of about 17 per cent of the speed of light, and seem to be similar to 
those from the prototype microquasar SS 433 (refs 11, 12). Such relativistic jets
are not expected to be launched from white dwarfs, and an origin from a black
hole or a neutron star is hard to reconcile with the persistence of M81 ULS-1's
soft X-rays. Thus the unexpected presence of relativistic jets in a ULS
challenges canonical theories of jet formation, but might be explained by a
long-speculated, supercritically accreting black hole with optically thick
outflows.

Soil biodiversity is increasingly recognized as providing benefits to human
health because it can suppress disease-causing soil organisms and provide clean
air, water and food. Poor land-management practices and environmental change are,
however, affecting belowground communities globally, and the resulting declines
in soil biodiversity reduce and impair these benefits. Importantly, current
research indicates that soil biodiversity can be maintained and partially
restored if managed sustainably. Promoting the ecological complexity and
robustness of soil biodiversity through improved management practices represents 
an underutilized resource with the ability to improve human health.

Drought threatens tropical rainforests over seasonal to decadal timescales, but
the drivers of tree mortality following drought remain poorly understood. It has 
been suggested that reduced availability of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC)
critically increases mortality risk through insufficient carbon supply to
metabolism ('carbon starvation'). However, little is known about how NSC stores
are affected by drought, especially over the long term, and whether they are more
important than hydraulic processes in determining drought-induced mortality.
Using data from the world's longest-running experimental drought study in
tropical rainforest (in the Brazilian Amazon), we test whether carbon starvation 
or deterioration of the water-conducting pathways from soil to leaf trigger tree 
mortality. Biomass loss from mortality in the experimentally droughted forest
increased substantially after >10 years of reduced soil moisture availability.
The mortality signal was dominated by the death of large trees, which were at a
much greater risk of hydraulic deterioration than smaller trees. However, we find
no evidence that the droughted trees suffered carbon starvation, as their NSC
concentrations were similar to those of non-droughted trees, and growth rates did
not decline in either living or dying trees. Our results indicate that
hydraulics, rather than carbon starvation, triggers tree death from drought in
tropical rainforest.

Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency in crop production are critical for
addressing the triple challenges of food security, environmental degradation and 
climate change. Such improvements are conditional not only on technological
innovation, but also on socio-economic factors that are at present poorly
understood. Here we examine historical patterns of agricultural nitrogen-use
efficiency and find a broad range of national approaches to agricultural
development and related pollution. We analyse examples of nitrogen use and
propose targets, by geographic region and crop type, to meet the 2050 global food
demand projected by the Food and Agriculture Organization while also meeting the 
Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to agriculture recently adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly. Furthermore, we discuss socio-economic policies 
and technological innovations that may help achieve them.

The exchange of nutrients, energy and carbon between soil organic matter, the
soil environment, aquatic systems and the atmosphere is important for
agricultural productivity, water quality and climate. Long-standing theory
suggests that soil organic matter is composed of inherently stable and chemically
unique compounds. Here we argue that the available evidence does not support the 
formation of large-molecular-size and persistent 'humic substances' in soils.
Instead, soil organic matter is a continuum of progressively decomposing organic 
compounds. We discuss implications of this view of the nature of soil organic
matter for aquatic health, soil carbon-climate interactions and land management.

Large parts of the Antarctic ice sheet lying on bedrock below sea level may be
vulnerable to marine-ice-sheet instability (MISI), a self-sustaining retreat of
the grounding line triggered by oceanic or atmospheric changes. There is growing 
evidence that MISI may be underway throughout the Amundsen Sea embayment (ASE),
which contains ice equivalent to more than a metre of global sea-level rise. If
triggered in other regions, the centennial to millennial contribution could be
several metres. Physically plausible projections are challenging: numerical
models with sufficient spatial resolution to simulate grounding-line processes
have been too computationally expensive to generate large ensembles for
uncertainty assessment, and lower-resolution model projections rely on
parameterizations that are only loosely constrained by present day changes. Here 
we project that the Antarctic ice sheet will contribute up to 30 cm sea-level
equivalent by 2100 and 72 cm by 2200 (95% quantiles) where the ASE dominates. Our
process-based, statistical approach gives skewed and complex probability
distributions (single mode, 10 cm, at 2100; two modes, 49 cm and 6 cm, at 2200). 
The dependence of sliding on basal friction is a key unknown: nonlinear
relationships favour higher contributions. Results are conditional on assessments
of MISI risk on the basis of projected triggers under the climate scenario A1B
(ref. 9), although sensitivity to these is limited by theoretical and
topographical constraints on the rate and extent of ice loss. We find that
contributions are restricted by a combination of these constraints, calibration
with success in simulating observed ASE losses, and low assessed risk in some
basins. Our assessment suggests that upper-bound estimates from low-resolution
models and physical arguments (up to a metre by 2100 and around one and a half by
2200) are implausible under current understanding of physical mechanisms and
potential triggers.

Age-associated insulin resistance (IR) and obesity-associated IR are two
physiologically distinct forms of adult-onset diabetes. While macrophage-driven
inflammation is a core driver of obesity-associated IR, the underlying mechanisms
of the obesity-independent yet highly prevalent age-associated IR are largely
unexplored. Here we show, using comparative adipo-immune profiling in mice, that 
fat-resident regulatory T cells, termed fTreg cells, accumulate in adipose tissue
as a function of age, but not obesity. Supporting the existence of two distinct
mechanisms underlying IR, mice deficient in fTreg cells are protected against
age-associated IR, yet remain susceptible to obesity-associated IR and metabolic 
disease. By contrast, selective depletion of fTreg cells via anti-ST2 antibody
treatment increases adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. These findings establish 
that distinct immune cell populations within adipose tissue underlie ageing- and 
obesity-associated IR, and implicate fTreg cells as adipo-immune drivers and
potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of age-associated IR.

Prevailing dogma holds that cell-cell communication through Notch ligands and
receptors determines binary cell fate decisions during progenitor cell divisions,
with differentiated lineages remaining fixed. Mucociliary clearance in mammalian 
respiratory airways depends on secretory cells (club and goblet) and ciliated
cells to produce and transport mucus. During development or repair, the closely
related Jagged ligands (JAG1 and JAG2) induce Notch signalling to determine the
fate of these lineages as they descend from a common proliferating progenitor. In
contrast to such situations in which cell fate decisions are made in rapidly
dividing populations, cells of the homeostatic adult airway epithelium are
long-lived, and little is known about the role of active Notch signalling under
such conditions. To disrupt Jagged signalling acutely in adult mammals, here we
generate antibody antagonists that selectively target each Jagged paralogue, and 
determine a crystal structure that explains selectivity. We show that acute
Jagged blockade induces a rapid and near-complete loss of club cells, with a
concomitant gain in ciliated cells, under homeostatic conditions without
increased cell death or division. Fate analyses demonstrate a direct conversion
of club cells to ciliated cells without proliferation, meeting a conservative
definition of direct transdifferentiation. Jagged inhibition also reversed goblet
cell metaplasia in a preclinical asthma model, providing a therapeutic
foundation. Our discovery that Jagged antagonism relieves a blockade of
cell-to-cell conversion unveils unexpected plasticity, and establishes a model
for Notch regulation of transdifferentiation.

A critical assumption underlying projections of biodiversity change associated
with global warming is that ecological communities comprise balanced mixes of
warm-affinity and cool-affinity species which, on average, approximate local
environmental temperatures. Nevertheless, here we find that most shallow water
marine species occupy broad thermal distributions that are aggregated in either
temperate or tropical realms. These distributional trends result in ocean-scale
spatial thermal biases, where communities are dominated by species with warmer or
cooler affinity than local environmental temperatures. We use community-level
thermal deviations from local temperatures as a form of sensitivity to warming,
and combine these with projected ocean warming data to predict warming-related
loss of species from present-day communities over the next century. Large changes
in local species composition appear likely, and proximity to thermal limits, as
inferred from present-day species' distributional ranges, outweighs spatial
variation in warming rates in contributing to predicted rates of local species
loss.

One of the most important questions in biology is how transcription factors (TFs)
and cofactors control enhancer function and thus gene expression. Enhancer
activation usually requires combinations of several TFs, indicating that TFs
function synergistically and combinatorially. However, while TF binding has been 
extensively studied, little is known about how combinations of TFs and cofactors 
control enhancer function once they are bound. It is typically unclear which TFs 
participate in combinatorial enhancer activation, whether different TFs form
functionally distinct groups, or if certain TFs might substitute for each other
in defined enhancer contexts. Here we assess the potential regulatory
contributions of TFs and cofactors to combinatorial enhancer control with
enhancer complementation assays. We recruited GAL4-DNA-binding-domain fusions of 
812 Drosophila TFs and cofactors to 24 enhancer contexts and measured enhancer
activities by 82,752 luciferase assays in S2 cells. Most factors were functional 
in at least one context, yet their contributions differed between contexts and
varied from repression to activation (up to 289-fold) for individual factors.
Based on functional similarities across contexts, we define 15 groups of TFs that
differ in developmental functions and protein sequence features. Similar TFs can 
substitute for each other, enabling enhancer re-engineering by exchanging TF
motifs, and TF-cofactor pairs cooperate during enhancer control and interact
physically. Overall, we show that activators and repressors can have diverse
regulatory functions that typically depend on the enhancer context. The
systematic functional characterization of TFs and cofactors should further our
understanding of combinatorial enhancer control and gene regulation.

Astrocytic brain tumours, including glioblastomas, are incurable neoplasms
characterized by diffusely infiltrative growth. Here we show that many tumour
cells in astrocytomas extend ultra-long membrane protrusions, and use these
distinct tumour microtubes as routes for brain invasion, proliferation, and to
interconnect over long distances. The resulting network allows multicellular
communication through microtube-associated gap junctions. When damage to the
network occurred, tumour microtubes were used for repair. Moreover, the
microtube-connected astrocytoma cells, but not those remaining unconnected
throughout tumour progression, were protected from cell death inflicted by
radiotherapy. The neuronal growth-associated protein 43 was important for
microtube formation and function, and drove microtube-dependent tumour cell
invasion, proliferation, interconnection, and radioresistance. Oligodendroglial
brain tumours were deficient in this mechanism. In summary, astrocytomas can
develop functional multicellular network structures. Disconnection of astrocytoma
cells by targeting their tumour microtubes emerges as a new principle to reduce
the treatment resistance of this disease.

Non-invasive imaging deep into organs at microscopic scales remains an open quest
in biomedical imaging. Although optical microscopy is still limited to surface
imaging owing to optical wave diffusion and fast decorrelation in tissue,
revolutionary approaches such as fluorescence photo-activated localization
microscopy led to a striking increase in resolution by more than an order of
magnitude in the last decade. In contrast with optics, ultrasonic waves propagate
deep into organs without losing their coherence and are much less affected by in 
vivo decorrelation processes. However, their resolution is impeded by the
fundamental limits of diffraction, which impose a long-standing trade-off between
resolution and penetration. This limits clinical and preclinical ultrasound
imaging to a sub-millimetre scale. Here we demonstrate in vivo that ultrasound
imaging at ultrafast frame rates (more than 500 frames per second) provides an
analogue to optical localization microscopy by capturing the transient signal
decorrelation of contrast agents--inert gas microbubbles. Ultrafast ultrasound
localization microscopy allowed both non-invasive sub-wavelength structural
imaging and haemodynamic quantification of rodent cerebral microvessels (less
than ten micrometres in diameter) more than ten millimetres below the tissue
surface, leading to transcranial whole-brain imaging within short acquisition
times (tens of seconds). After intravenous injection, single echoes from
individual microbubbles were detected through ultrafast imaging. Their
localization, not limited by diffraction, was accumulated over 75,000 images,
yielding 1,000,000 events per coronal plane and statistically independent pixels 
of ten micrometres in size. Precise temporal tracking of microbubble positions
allowed us to extract accurately in-plane velocities of the blood flow with a
large dynamic range (from one millimetre per second to several centimetres per
second). These results pave the way for deep non-invasive microscopy in animals
and humans using ultrasound. We anticipate that ultrafast ultrasound localization
microscopy may become an invaluable tool for the fundamental understanding and
diagnostics of various disease processes that modify the microvascular blood
flow, such as cancer, stroke and arteriosclerosis.

Fermions--elementary particles such as electrons--are classified as Dirac,
Majorana or Weyl. Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally
until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological
superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations.
Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion
that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of 
matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz 
symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in
condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new
type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals--materials hosting
Weyl fermions--were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a
point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II
Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of
electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an 
example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy
excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points
in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of
standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces.

The Moon is generally thought to have formed from the debris ejected by the
impact of a planet-sized object with the proto-Earth towards the end of planetary
accretion. Models of the impact process predict that the lunar material was
disaggregated into a circumplanetary disk and that lunar accretion subsequently
placed the Moon in a near-equatorial orbit. Forward integration of the lunar
orbit from this initial state predicts a modern inclination at least an order of 
magnitude smaller than the lunar value--a long-standing discrepancy known as the 
lunar inclination problem. Here we show that the modern lunar orbit provides a
sensitive record of gravitational interactions with Earth-crossing planetesimals 
that were not yet accreted at the time of the Moon-forming event. The currently
observed lunar orbit can naturally be reproduced via interaction with a small
quantity of mass (corresponding to 0.0075-0.015 Earth masses eventually accreted 
to the Earth) carried by a few bodies, consistent with the constraints and models
of late accretion. Although the encounter process has a stochastic element, the
observed value of the lunar inclination is among the most likely outcomes for a
wide range of parameters. The excitation of the lunar orbit is most readily
reproduced via collisionless encounters of planetesimals with the Earth-Moon
system with strong dissipation of tidal energy on the early Earth. This mechanism
obviates the need for previously proposed (but idealized) excitation mechanisms, 
places the Moon-forming event in the context of the formation of Earth, and
constrains the pristineness of the dynamical state of the Earth-Moon system.

Circadian clocks are endogenous timers adjusting behaviour and physiology with
the solar day. Synchronized circadian clocks improve fitness and are crucial for 
our physical and mental well-being. Visual and non-visual photoreceptors are
responsible for synchronizing circadian clocks to light, but clock-resetting is
also achieved by alternating day and night temperatures with only 2-4 °C
difference. This temperature sensitivity is remarkable considering that the
circadian clock period (~24 h) is largely independent of surrounding ambient
temperatures. Here we show that Drosophila Ionotropic Receptor 25a (IR25a) is
required for behavioural synchronization to low-amplitude temperature cycles.
This channel is expressed in sensory neurons of internal stretch receptors
previously implicated in temperature synchronization of the circadian clock.
IR25a is required for temperature-synchronized clock protein oscillations in
subsets of central clock neurons. Extracellular leg nerve recordings reveal
temperature- and IR25a-dependent sensory responses, and IR25a misexpression
confers temperature-dependent firing of heterologous neurons. We propose that
IR25a is part of an input pathway to the circadian clock that detects small
temperature differences. This pathway operates in the absence of known 'hot' and 
'cold' sensors in the Drosophila antenna, revealing the existence of novel
periphery-to-brain temperature signalling channels.

Taste is responsible for evaluating the nutritious content of food, guiding
essential appetitive behaviours, preventing the ingestion of toxic substances,
and helping to ensure the maintenance of a healthy diet. Sweet and bitter are two
of the most salient sensory percepts for humans and other animals; sweet taste
allows the identification of energy-rich nutrients whereas bitter warns against
the intake of potentially noxious chemicals. In mammals, information from taste
receptor cells in the tongue is transmitted through multiple neural stations to
the primary gustatory cortex in the brain. Recent imaging studies have shown that
sweet and bitter are represented in the primary gustatory cortex by neurons
organized in a spatial map, with each taste quality encoded by distinct cortical 
fields. Here we demonstrate that by manipulating the brain fields representing
sweet and bitter taste we directly control an animal's internal representation,
sensory perception, and behavioural actions. These results substantiate the
segregation of taste qualities in the cortex, expose the innate nature of
appetitive and aversive taste responses, and illustrate the ability of gustatory 
cortex to recapitulate complex behaviours in the absence of sensory input.

Acorn worms, also known as enteropneust (literally, 'gut-breathing')
hemichordates, are marine invertebrates that share features with echinoderms and 
chordates. Together, these three phyla comprise the deuterostomes. Here we report
the draft genome sequences of two acorn worms, Saccoglossus kowalevskii and
Ptychodera flava. By comparing them with diverse bilaterian genomes, we identify 
shared traits that were probably inherited from the last common deuterostome
ancestor, and then explore evolutionary trajectories leading from this ancestor
to hemichordates, echinoderms and chordates. The hemichordate genomes exhibit
extensive conserved synteny with amphioxus and other bilaterians, and deeply
conserved non-coding sequences that are candidates for conserved gene-regulatory 
elements. Notably, hemichordates possess a deuterostome-specific genomic cluster 
of four ordered transcription factor genes, the expression of which is associated
with the development of pharyngeal 'gill' slits, the foremost morphological
innovation of early deuterostomes, and is probably central to their
filter-feeding lifestyle. Comparative analysis reveals numerous
deuterostome-specific gene novelties, including genes found in deuterostomes and 
marine microbes, but not other animals. The putative functions of these genes can
be linked to physiological, metabolic and developmental specializations of the
filter-feeding ancestor.

Ubiquitous time variability of integrated stellar populations.

Long-period variable stars arise in the final stages of the asymptotic giant
branch phase of stellar evolution. They have periods of up to about 1,000 days
and amplitudes that can exceed a factor of three in the I-band flux. These stars 
pulsate predominantly in their fundamental mode, which is a function of mass and 
radius, and so the pulsation periods are sensitive to the age of the underlying
stellar population. The overall number of long-period variables in a population
is directly related to their lifetimes, which is difficult to predict from first 
principles because of uncertainties associated with stellar mass-loss and
convective mixing. The time variability of these stars has not previously been
taken into account when modelling the spectral energy distributions of galaxies. 
Here we construct time-dependent stellar population models that include the
effects of long-period variable stars, and report the ubiquitous detection of
this expected 'pixel shimmer' in the massive metal-rich galaxy M87. The pixel
light curves display a variety of behaviours. The observed variation of 0.1 to 1 
per cent is very well matched to the predictions of our models. The data provide 
a strong constraint on the properties of variable stars in an old and metal-rich 
stellar population, and we infer that the lifetime of long-period variables in
M87 is shorter by approximately 30 per cent compared to predictions from the
latest stellar evolution models.

Haematopoietic stresses mobilize haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone
marrow to the spleen and induce extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH). However, the
cellular nature of the EMH niche is unknown. Here we assessed the sources of the 
key niche factors, SCF (also known as KITL) and CXCL12, in the mouse spleen after
EMH induction by myeloablation, blood loss, or pregnancy. In each case, Scf was
expressed by endothelial cells and Tcf21(+) stromal cells, primarily around
sinusoids in the red pulp, while Cxcl12 was expressed by a subset of Tcf21(+)
stromal cells. EMH induction markedly expanded the Scf-expressing endothelial
cells and stromal cells by inducing proliferation. Most splenic HSCs were
adjacent to Tcf21(+) stromal cells in red pulp. Conditional deletion of Scf from 
spleen endothelial cells, or of Scf or Cxcl12 from Tcf21+ stromal cells, severely
reduced spleen EMH and reduced blood cell counts without affecting bone marrow
haematopoiesis. Endothelial cells and Tcf21(+) stromal cells thus create a
perisinusoidal EMH niche in the spleen, which is necessary for the physiological 
response to diverse haematopoietic stresses.

The first stars are predicted to have formed within 200 million years after the
Big Bang, initiating the cosmic dawn. A true first star has not yet been
discovered, although stars with tiny amounts of elements heavier than helium
('metals') have been found in the outer regions ('halo') of the Milky Way. The
first stars and their immediate successors should, however, preferentially be
found today in the central regions ('bulges') of galaxies, because they formed in
the largest over-densities that grew gravitationally with time. The Milky Way
bulge underwent a rapid chemical enrichment during the first 1-2 billion years,
leading to a dearth of early, metal-poor stars. Here we report observations of
extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge, including one star with an
iron abundance about 10,000 times lower than the solar value without noticeable
carbon enhancement. We confirm that most of the metal-poor bulge stars are on
tight orbits around the Galactic Centre, rather than being halo stars passing
through the bulge, as expected for stars formed at redshifts greater than 15.
Their chemical compositions are in general similar to typical halo stars of the
same metallicity although intriguing differences exist, including lower
abundances of carbon.

The role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in metastasis is a
longstanding source of debate, largely owing to an inability to monitor transient
and reversible EMT phenotypes in vivo. Here we establish an EMT lineage-tracing
system to monitor this process in mice, using a mesenchymal-specific Cre-mediated
fluorescent marker switch system in spontaneous breast-to-lung metastasis models.
We show that within a predominantly epithelial primary tumour, a small proportion
of tumour cells undergo EMT. Notably, lung metastases mainly consist of non-EMT
tumour cells that maintain their epithelial phenotype. Inhibiting EMT by
overexpressing the microRNA miR-200 does not affect lung metastasis development. 
However, EMT cells significantly contribute to recurrent lung metastasis
formation after chemotherapy. These cells survived cyclophosphamide treatment
owing to reduced proliferation, apoptotic tolerance and increased expression of
chemoresistance-related genes. Overexpression of miR-200 abrogated this
resistance. This study suggests the potential of an EMT-targeting strategy, in
conjunction with conventional chemotherapies, for breast cancer treatment.

Plant genomes, and eukaryotic genomes in general, are typically repetitive,
polyploid and heterozygous, which complicates genome assembly. The short read
lengths of early Sanger and current next-generation sequencing platforms hinder
assembly through complex repeat regions, and many draft and reference genomes are
fragmented, lacking skewed GC and repetitive intergenic sequences, which are
gaining importance due to projects like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE). Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the
desiccation-tolerant grass Oropetium thomaeum. Using only single-molecule
real-time sequencing, which generates long (>16 kilobases) reads with random
errors, we assembled 99% (244 megabases) of the Oropetium genome into 625 contigs
with an N50 length of 2.4 megabases. Oropetium is an example of a 'near-complete'
draft genome which includes gapless coverage over gene space as well as
intergenic sequences such as centromeres, telomeres, transposable elements and
rRNA clusters that are typically unassembled in draft genomes. Oropetium has
28,466 protein-coding genes and 43% repeat sequences, yet with 30% more compact
euchromatic regions it is the smallest known grass genome. The Oropetium genome
demonstrates the utility of single-molecule real-time sequencing for assembling
high-quality plant and other eukaryotic genomes, and serves as a valuable
resource for the plant comparative genomics community.

Diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with a dismal 
prognosis despite current best therapies; therefore new treatment strategies are 
urgently required. Numerous studies have suggested that epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) contributes to early-stage dissemination of cancer cells and is 
pivotal for invasion and metastasis of PDAC. EMT is associated with phenotypic
conversion of epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells in cell culture
conditions, although such defined mesenchymal conversion (with spindle-shaped
morphology) of epithelial cells in vivo is rare, with quasi-mesenchymal
phenotypes occasionally observed in the tumour (partial EMT). Most studies
exploring the functional role of EMT in tumours have depended on
cell-culture-induced loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments involving 
EMT-inducing transcription factors such as Twist, Snail and Zeb1 (refs 2, 3,
7-10). Therefore, the functional contribution of EMT to invasion and metastasis
remains unclear, and genetically engineered mouse models to address a causal
connection are lacking. Here we functionally probe the role of EMT in PDAC by
generating mouse models of PDAC with deletion of Snail or Twist, two key
transcription factors responsible for EMT. EMT suppression in the primary tumour 
does not alter the emergence of invasive PDAC, systemic dissemination or
metastasis. Suppression of EMT leads to an increase in cancer cell proliferation 
with enhanced expression of nucleoside transporters in tumours, contributing to
enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine treatment and increased overall survival of
mice. Collectively, our study suggests that Snail- or Twist-induced EMT is not
rate-limiting for invasion and metastasis, but highlights the importance of
combining EMT inhibition with chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer.

At least 120 non-olfactory G-protein-coupled receptors in the human genome are
'orphans' for which endogenous ligands are unknown, and many have no selective
ligands, hindering the determination of their biological functions and clinical
relevance. Among these is GPR68, a proton receptor that lacks small molecule
modulators for probing its biology. Using yeast-based screens against GPR68, here
we identify the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam as a non-selective GPR68 positive
allosteric modulator. More than 3,000 GPR68 homology models were refined to
recognize lorazepam in a putative allosteric site. Docking 3.1 million molecules 
predicted new GPR68 modulators, many of which were confirmed in functional
assays. One potent GPR68 modulator, ogerin, suppressed recall in fear
conditioning in wild-type but not in GPR68-knockout mice. The same approach led
to the discovery of allosteric agonists and negative allosteric modulators for
GPR65. Combining physical and structure-based screening may be broadly useful for
ligand discovery for understudied and orphan GPCRs.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have a high internal surface area and widely
tunable composition, which make them useful for applications involving
adsorption, such as hydrogen, methane or carbon dioxide storage. The selectivity 
and uptake capacity of the adsorption process are determined by interactions
involving the adsorbates and their porous host materials. But, although the
interactions of adsorbate molecules with the internal MOF surface and also
amongst themselves within individual pores have been extensively studied,
adsorbate-adsorbate interactions across pore walls have not been explored. Here
we show that local strain in the MOF, induced by pore filling, can give rise to
collective and long-range adsorbate-adsorbate interactions and the formation of
adsorbate superlattices that extend beyond an original MOF unit cell.
Specifically, we use in situ small-angle X-ray scattering to track and map the
distribution and ordering of adsorbate molecules in five members of the
mesoporous MOF-74 series along entire adsorption-desorption isotherms. We find in
all cases that the capillary condensation that fills the pores gives rise to the 
formation of 'extra adsorption domains'-that is, domains spanning several
neighbouring pores, which have a higher adsorbate density than non-domain pores. 
In the case of one MOF, IRMOF-74-V-hex, these domains form a superlattice
structure that is difficult to reconcile with the prevailing view of pore-filling
as a stochastic process. The visualization of the adsorption process provided by 
our data, with clear evidence for initial adsorbate aggregation in distinct
domains and ordering before an even distribution is finally reached, should help 
to improve our understanding of this process and may thereby improve our ability 
to exploit it practically.

Many peroxy-containing secondary metabolites have been isolated and shown to
provide beneficial effects to human health. Yet, the mechanisms of most
endoperoxide biosyntheses are not well understood. Although endoperoxides have
been suggested as key reaction intermediates in several cases, the only
well-characterized endoperoxide biosynthetic enzyme is prostaglandin H synthase, 
a haem-containing enzyme. Fumitremorgin B endoperoxidase (FtmOx1) from
Aspergillus fumigatus is the first reported α-ketoglutarate-dependent mononuclear
non-haem iron enzyme that can catalyse an endoperoxide formation reaction. To
elucidate the mechanistic details for this unique chemical transformation, we
report the X-ray crystal structures of FtmOx1 and the binary complexes it forms
with either the co-substrate (α-ketoglutarate) or the substrate (fumitremorgin
B). Uniquely, after α-ketoglutarate has bound to the mononuclear iron centre in a
bidentate fashion, the remaining open site for oxygen binding and activation is
shielded from the substrate or the solvent by a tyrosine residue (Y224). Upon
replacing Y224 with alanine or phenylalanine, the FtmOx1 catalysis diverts from
endoperoxide formation to the more commonly observed hydroxylation. Subsequent
characterizations by a combination of stopped-flow optical absorption
spectroscopy and freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
support the presence of transient radical species in FtmOx1 catalysis. Our
results help to unravel the novel mechanism for this endoperoxide formation
reaction.

For more than a century, fungal pathogens and symbionts have been known to orient
hyphal growth towards chemical stimuli from the host plant. However, the nature
of the plant signals as well as the mechanisms underlying the chemotropic
response have remained elusive. Here we show that directed growth of the
soil-inhabiting plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum towards the roots of the host
tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is triggered by the catalytic activity of secreted 
class III peroxidases, a family of haem-containing enzymes present in all land
plants. The chemotropic response requires conserved elements of the fungal cell
integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and the seven-pass
transmembrane protein Ste2, a functional homologue of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae sex pheromone α receptor. We further show that directed hyphal growth 
of F. oxysporum towards nutrient sources such as sugars and amino acids is
governed by a functionally distinct MAPK cascade. These results reveal a
potentially conserved chemotropic mechanism in root-colonizing fungi, and suggest
a new function for the fungal pheromone-sensing machinery in locating plant hosts
in a complex environment such as the soil.

Viruses in the Reoviridae, like the triple-shelled human rotavirus and the
single-shelled insect cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV), all package a genome 
of segmented double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) inside the viral capsid and carry out 
endogenous messenger RNA synthesis through a transcriptional enzyme complex
(TEC). By direct electron-counting cryoelectron microscopy and asymmetric
reconstruction, we have determined the organization of the dsRNA genome inside
quiescent CPV (q-CPV) and the in situ atomic structures of TEC within CPV in both
quiescent and transcribing (t-CPV) states. We show that the ten segmented dsRNAs 
in CPV are organized with ten TECs in a specific, non-symmetric manner, with each
dsRNA segment attached directly to a TEC. The TEC consists of two extensively
interacting subunits: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and an NTPase VP4.
We find that the bracelet domain of RdRP undergoes marked conformational change
when q-CPV is converted to t-CPV, leading to formation of the RNA template entry 
channel and access to the polymerase active site. An amino-terminal helix from
each of two subunits of the capsid shell protein (CSP) interacts with VP4 and
RdRP. These findings establish the link between sensing of environmental cues by 
the external proteins and activation of endogenous RNA transcription by the TEC
inside the virus.

Bacteria and archaea generate adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by
integrating foreign DNA of specific 30-40-base-pair lengths into clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci as spacer segments. 
The universally conserved Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex catalyses spacer
acquisition using a direct nucleophilic integration mechanism similar to
retroviral integrases and transposases. How the Cas1-Cas2 complex selects foreign
DNA substrates for integration remains unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal
structures of the Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2 complex bound to cognate
33-nucleotide protospacer DNA substrates. The protein complex creates a curved
binding surface spanning the length of the DNA and splays the ends of the
protospacer to allow each terminal nucleophilic 3'-OH to enter a channel leading 
into the Cas1 active sites. Phosphodiester backbone interactions between the
protospacer and the proteins explain the sequence-nonspecific substrate selection
observed in vivo. Our results uncover the structural basis for foreign DNA
capture and the mechanism by which Cas1-Cas2 functions as a molecular ruler to
dictate the sequence architecture of CRISPR loci.

Marine sediments from the North Pacific document two episodes of expansion and
strengthening of the subsurface oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) accompanied by seafloor
hypoxia during the last deglacial transition. The mechanisms driving this hypoxia
remain under debate. We present a new high-resolution alkenone palaeotemperature 
reconstruction from the Gulf of Alaska that reveals two abrupt warming events of 
4-5 degrees Celsius at the onset of the Bølling and Holocene intervals that
coincide with sudden shifts to hypoxia at intermediate depths. The presence of
diatomaceous laminations and hypoxia-tolerant benthic foraminiferal species,
peaks in redox-sensitive trace metals, and enhanced (15)N/(14)N ratio of organic 
matter, collectively suggest association with high export production. A decrease 
in (18)O/(16)O values of benthic foraminifera accompanying the most severe
deoxygenation event indicates subsurface warming of up to about 2 degrees
Celsius. We infer that abrupt warming triggered expansion of the North Pacific
OMZ through reduced oxygen solubility and increased marine productivity via
physiological effects; following initiation of hypoxia, remobilization of iron
from hypoxic sediments could have provided a positive feedback on ocean
deoxygenation through increased nutrient utilization and carbon export. Such a
biogeochemical amplification process implies high sensitivity of OMZ expansion to
warming.

When used in combination with raster scanning, small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique of the nanoscale, for
example of bone, teeth and brain matter. Although two-dimensional projection
imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its
three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomography, poses substantial
challenges, which have yet to be overcome. Previous work using SAXS computed
tomography was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction.
Here we present a solution to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed
tomography, which preserves oriented scattering information. By introducing
virtual tomography axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS
information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full
three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of
the three-dimensional object in real space. The presented method could be of
interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space
characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features 
with length scales ranging from a few nanometres to a few millimetres--for
example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as
fuel-cell or battery components.

The mechanical properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic
arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure. This nanostructure can be
ordered over a range of length scales. In biology, the principle of hierarchical 
ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness
of the material, while minimizing weight and energy cost. Methods for nanoscale
imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure
that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is 
limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the
ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample. Other methods of probing ultrastructure
ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to
macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to
two-dimensional specimens or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures. These
constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more 
complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science.
Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with
tensor tomography to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic 
samples in a non-destructive way. We demonstrate the method by measuring the main
orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen
fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resolution of 25
micrometres. Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry
commonly observed for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone, allow for tractable
sampling requirements and numerical efficiency. Small-angle scattering tensor
tomography is applicable to both biological and materials science specimens, and 
may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired
materials. Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for
in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the
mechanical response of a biological tissue or manufactured material to be
studied.

Exoplanet detections have revolutionized astronomy, offering new insights into
solar system architecture and planet demographics. While nearly 1,900 exoplanets 
have now been discovered and confirmed, none are still in the process of
formation. Transition disks, protoplanetary disks with inner clearings best
explained by the influence of accreting planets, are natural laboratories for the
study of planet formation. Some transition disks show evidence for the presence
of young planets in the form of disk asymmetries or infrared sources detected
within their clearings, as in the case of LkCa 15 (refs 8, 9). Attempts to
observe directly signatures of accretion onto protoplanets have hitherto proven
unsuccessful. Here we report adaptive optics observations of LkCa 15 that probe
within the disk clearing. With accurate source positions over multiple epochs
spanning 2009-2015, we infer the presence of multiple companions on Keplerian
orbits. We directly detect Hα emission from the innermost companion, LkCa 15 b,
evincing hot (about 10,000 kelvin) gas falling deep into the potential well of an
accreting protoplanet.

The global burden of neurological, neuropsychiatric, substance-use and
neurodevelopmental disorders in low- and middle-income countries is worsened, not
only by the lack of targeted research funding, but also by the lack of relevant
in-country research capacity. Such capacity, from the individual to the national 
level, is necessary to address the problems within a local context. As for many
health issues in these countries, the ability to address this burden requires
development of research infrastructure and a trained cadre of clinicians and
scientists who can ask the right questions, and conduct, manage, apply and
disseminate research for practice and policy. This Review describes some of the
evolving issues, knowledge and programmes focused on building research capacity
in low- and middle-income countries in general and for brain and nervous system
disorders in particular.

The characteristics of neurological, psychiatric, developmental and substance-use
disorders in low- and middle-income countries are unique and the burden that they
have will be different from country to country. Many of the differences are
explained by the wide variation in population demographics and size, poverty,
conflict, culture, land area and quality, and genetics. Neurological,
psychiatric, developmental and substance-use disorders that result from, or are
worsened by, a lack of adequate nutrition and infectious disease still afflict
much of sub-Saharan Africa, although disorders related to increasing longevity,
such as stroke, are on the rise. In the Middle East and North Africa, major
depressive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are a primary concern
because of the conflict-ridden environment. Consanguinity is a serious concern
that leads to the high prevalence of recessive disorders in the Middle East and
North Africa and possibly other regions. The burden of these disorders in Latin
American and Asian countries largely surrounds stroke and vascular disease,
dementia and lifestyle factors that are influenced by genetics. Although much
knowledge has been gained over the past 10 years, the epidemiology of the
conditions in low- and middle-income countries still needs more research.
Prevention and treatments could be better informed with more longitudinal studies
of risk factors. Challenges and opportunities for ameliorating nervous-system
disorders can benefit from both local and regional research collaborations. The
lack of resources and infrastructure for health-care and related research, both
in terms of personnel and equipment, along with the stigma associated with the
physical or behavioural manifestations of some disorders have hampered progress
in understanding the disease burden and improving brain health. Individual
countries, and regions within countries, have specific needs in terms of research
priorities.

Traumatic injury to the brain or spinal cord is one of the most serious public
health problems worldwide. The devastating impact of 'trauma', a term used to
define the global burden of disease related to all injuries, is the leading cause
of loss of human potential across the globe, especially in low- and middle-income
countries. Enormous challenges must be met to significantly advance neurotrauma
research around the world, specifically in underserved and austere environments. 
Neurotrauma research at the global level needs to be contextualized: different
regions have their own needs and obstacles. Interventions that are not considered
a priority in some regions could be a priority for others. The introduction of
inexpensive and innovative interventions, including mobile technologies and
e-health applications, focused on policy management improvement are essential and
should be applicable to the needs of the local environment. The simple transfer
of a clinical question from resource-rich environments to those of low- and
middle-income countries that lack sophisticated interventions may not be the best
strategy to address these countries' needs. Emphasis on promoting the design of
true 'ecological' studies that include the evaluation of human factors in
relation to the process of care, analytical descriptions of health systems, and
how leadership is best applied in medical communities and society as a whole will
become crucial.

Economic transitions in the era of globalization warrant a fresh look at the
neurological risks associated with environmental change. These are driven by
industrial expansion, transfer and mobility of goods, climate change and
population growth. In these contexts, risk of infectious and non-infectious
diseases are shared across geographical boundaries. In low- and middle-income
countries, the risk of environmentally mediated brain disease is augmented
several fold by lack of infrastructure, poor health and safety regulations, and
limited measures for environmental protection. Neurological disorders may occur
as a result of direct exposure to chemical and/or non-chemical stressors,
including but not limited to, ultrafine particulate matters. Individual
susceptibilities to exposure-related diseases are modified by genetic, epigenetic
and metagenomic factors. The existence of several uniquely exposed populations,
including those in the areas surrounding the Niger Delta or north western Amazon 
oil operations; those working in poorly regulated environments, such as artisanal
mining industries; or those, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, relying on cassava as 
a staple food, offers invaluable opportunities to advance the current
understanding of brain responses to environmental challenges. Increased awareness
of the brain disorders that are prevalent in low- and middle-income countries and
investments in capacity for further environmental health-related research are
positive steps towards improving human health.

Infections that cause significant nervous system morbidity globally include viral
(for example, HIV, rabies, Japanese encephalitis virus, herpes simplex virus,
varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus and chikungunya virus),
bacterial (for example, tuberculosis, syphilis, bacterial meningitis and sepsis),
fungal (for example, cryptococcal meningitis) and parasitic (for example,
malaria, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths)
infections. The neurological, cognitive, behavioural or mental health problems
caused by the infections probably affect millions of children and adults in low- 
and middle-income countries. However, precise estimates of morbidity are lacking 
for most infections, and there is limited information on the pathogenesis of
nervous system injury in these infections. Key research priorities for
infection-related nervous system morbidity include accurate estimates of disease 
burden; point-of-care assays for infection diagnosis; improved tools for the
assessment of neurological, cognitive and mental health impairment; vaccines and 
other interventions for preventing infections; improved understanding of the
pathogenesis of nervous system disease in these infections; more effective
methods to treat and prevent nervous system sequelae; operations research to
implement known effective interventions; and improved methods of rehabilitation. 
Research in these areas, accompanied by efforts to implement promising
technologies and therapies, could substantially decrease the morbidity and
mortality of infections affecting the nervous system in low- and middle-income
countries.

The research agenda for global mental health and substance-use disorders has been
largely driven by the exigencies of high health burdens and associated unmet
needs in low- and middle-income countries. Implementation research focused on
context-driven adaptation and innovation in service delivery has begun to yield
promising results that are improving the quality of, and access to, care in
low-resource settings. Importantly, these efforts have also resulted in the
development and augmentation of local, in-country research capacities. Given the 
complex interplay between mental health and substance-use disorders, medical
conditions, and biological and social vulnerabilities, a revitalized research
agenda must encompass both local variation and global commonalities in the impact
of adversities, multi-morbidities and their consequences across the life course. 
We recommend priorities for research - as well as guiding principles for
context-driven, intersectoral, integrative approaches - that will advance
knowledge and answer the most pressing local and global mental health questions
and needs, while also promoting a health equity agenda and extending the quality,
reach and impact of scientific enquiry.

The resiliency of the adult nervous system is markedly affected by the
environment and the circumstances during infant and child development. As such,
adults in resource-limited settings who may have experienced early deprivation
are particularly vulnerable to subsequent neurological disorders. Adult
populations in countries with relatively recent advances in economic development 
may still have a higher susceptibility to neurological illness or injury that is 
reflective of the socioeconomic environment that was present during that
population's infancy and childhood. Brain and peripheral nervous system research 
conducted over the past decade in resource-limited settings has led to an
impressive and growing body of knowledge that informs our understanding of
neurological function and dysfunction, independent of geography. Neurological
conditions feature prominently in the burgeoning epidemic of non-communicable
diseases facing low- and middle-income countries. Neurological research in these 
countries is needed to address this burden of disease. Although the burden of
more prevalent and severe neurological disease poses public health and clinical
challenges in settings with limited neurological expertise, the same factors,
along with genetic heterogeneity and the relative absence of ingrained clinical
care practices, offer circumstances well-suited for the conduct of crucial future
research that is globally relevant.

Globally, there is a crucial need to prioritize research directed at reducing
neurological, mental health and substance-use disorders in adolescence, which is 
a pivotal age for the development of self-control and regulation. In adolescence,
behaviour optimally advances towards adaptive long-term goals and suppresses
conflicting maladaptive short-lived urges to balance impulsivity, exploration and
defiance, while establishing effective societal participation. When self-control 
fails to develop, violence, injury and neurological, mental health and
substance-use disorders can result, further challenging the development of
self-regulation and impeding the transition to a productive adulthood. Adolescent
outcomes, positive and negative, arise from both a life-course perspective and
within a socioecological framework. Little is known about the emergence of
self-control and regulation in adolescents in low- and middle-income countries
where enormous environmental threats are more common (for example, poverty, war, 
local conflicts, sex trafficking and slavery, early marriage and/or pregnancy,
and the absence of adequate access to education) than in high-income countries
and can threaten optimal neurodevelopment. Research must develop or adapt
appropriate assessments of adolescent ability and disability, social inclusion
and exclusion, normative development, and neurological, mental health and
substance-use disorders. Socioecological challenges in low- and middle-income
countries require innovative strategies to prevent mental health, neurological
and substance-use disorders and develop effective interventions for adolescents
at risk, especially those already living with these disorders and the consequent 
disability.

We define neurodevelopment as the dynamic inter-relationship between genetic,
brain, cognitive, emotional and behavioural processes across the developmental
lifespan. Significant and persistent disruption to this dynamic process through
environmental and genetic risk can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders and
disability. Research designed to ameliorate neurodevelopmental disorders in low- 
and middle-income countries, as well as globally, will benefit enormously from
the ongoing advances in understanding their genetic and epigenetic causes, as
modified by environment and culture. We provide examples of advances in the
prevention and treatment of, and the rehabilitation of those with,
neurodevelopment disorders in low- and middle-income countries, along with
opportunities for further strategic research initiatives. Our examples are not
the only possibilities for strategic research, but they illustrate problems that,
when solved, could have a considerable impact in low-resource settings. In each
instance, research in low- and middle-income countries led to innovations in
identification, surveillance and treatment of a neurodevelopmental disorder.
These innovations have also been integrated with genotypic mapping of
neurodevelopmental disorders, forming important preventative and rehabilitative
interventions with the potential for high impact. These advances will ultimately 
allow us to understand how epigenetic influences shape neurodevelopmental risk
and resilience over time and across populations. Clearly, the most strategic
areas of research opportunity involve cross-disciplinary integration at the
intersection between the environment, brain or behaviour neurodevelopment, and
genetic and epigenetic science. At these junctions a robust integrative
cross-disciplinary scientific approach is catalysing the creation of technologies
and interventions for old problems. Such approaches will enable us to achieve and
sustain the United Nations moral and legal mandate for child health and full
development as a basic global human right.

This is an exciting time for scientific discovery that aims to reduce the
frequency and impact of neurological, mental health and substance-use disorders. 
As it became increasingly clear that low- and middle-income countries have a
disproportionate share of these disorders, and that many of the problems are best
addressed by indigenous researchers who can seek context-sensitive solutions, the
US National Institutes of Health and other research funders began to invest more 
in low- and middle-income country-focused research and research capacity-building
to confront this significant public health challenge. In an effort to identify
existing information, knowledge gaps, and emerging research and research
capacity-building opportunities that are particularly relevant to low- and
middle-income countries, in February 2014 the Center for Global Health Studies at
the National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center held a workshop to
explore these issues with scientific experts from low- and middle-income
countries and the United States. This evolved into the preparation of the Reviews
in this supplement, which is designed to highlight opportunities and challenges
associated with topical areas in brain-disorders research over the coming decade.
This Introduction highlights some of the over-arching and intersecting priorities
for addressing causes, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation as well as best
practices to promote overall nervous system health. We review some brain
disorders in low- and middle-income countries, while the Reviews describe
relevant issues and the epidemiology of particular conditions in greater depth.

Cancer cells hijack and remodel existing metabolic pathways for their benefit.
Argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) is a urea cycle enzyme that is essential in the
conversion of nitrogen from ammonia and aspartate to urea. A decrease in nitrogen
flux through ASS1 in the liver causes the urea cycle disorder citrullinaemia. In 
contrast to the well-studied consequences of loss of ASS1 activity on
ureagenesis, the purpose of its somatic silencing in multiple cancers is largely 
unknown. Here we show that decreased activity of ASS1 in cancers supports
proliferation by facilitating pyrimidine synthesis via CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate
synthase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase complex) activation.
Our studies were initiated by delineating the consequences of loss of ASS1
activity in humans with two types of citrullinaemia. We find that in
citrullinaemia type I (CTLN I), which is caused by deficiency of ASS1, there is
increased pyrimidine synthesis and proliferation compared with citrullinaemia
type II (CTLN II), in which there is decreased substrate availability for ASS1
caused by deficiency of the aspartate transporter citrin. Building on these
results, we demonstrate that ASS1 deficiency in cancer increases cytosolic
aspartate levels, which increases CAD activation by upregulating its substrate
availability and by increasing its phosphorylation by S6K1 through the mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Decreasing CAD activity by blocking citrin,
the mTOR signalling, or pyrimidine synthesis decreases proliferation and thus may
serve as a therapeutic strategy in multiple cancers where ASS1 is downregulated. 
Our results demonstrate that ASS1 downregulation is a novel mechanism supporting 
cancerous proliferation, and they provide a metabolic link between the urea cycle
enzymes and pyrimidine synthesis.

Drosophila Decapentaplegic (Dpp) has served as a paradigm to study
morphogen-dependent growth control. However, the role of a Dpp gradient in tissue
growth remains highly controversial. Two fundamentally different models have been
proposed: the 'temporal rule' model suggests that all cells of the wing imaginal 
disc divide upon a 50% increase in Dpp signalling, whereas the 'growth
equalization model' suggests that Dpp is only essential for proliferation control
of the central cells. Here, to discriminate between these two models, we
generated and used morphotrap, a membrane-tethered anti-green fluorescent protein
(GFP) nanobody, which enables immobilization of enhanced (e)GFP::Dpp on the cell 
surface, thereby abolishing Dpp gradient formation. We find that in the absence
of Dpp spreading, wing disc patterning is lost; however, lateral cells still
divide at normal rates. These data are consistent with the growth equalization
model, but do not fit a global temporal rule model in the wing imaginal disc.

As a central model for morphogen action during animal development, the bone
morphogenetic protein 2/4 (BMP2/4)-like ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is proposed 
to form a long-range signalling gradient that directs both growth and pattern
formation during Drosophila wing disc development. While the patterning role of
Dpp secreted from a stripe of cells along the anterior-posterior compartmental
boundary is well established, the mechanism by which a Dpp gradient directs
uniform cell proliferation remains controversial and poorly understood. Here, to 
determine the precise spatiotemporal requirements for Dpp during wing disc
development, we use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate a flippase
recognition target (FRT)-dependent conditional null allele. By genetically
removing Dpp from its endogenous stripe domain, we confirm the requirement of Dpp
for the activation of a downstream phospho-Mothers against dpp (p-Mad) gradient
and the regulation of the patterning targets spalt (sal), optomotor blind (omb;
also known as bifid) and brinker (brk). Surprisingly, however, third-instar wing 
blade primordia devoid of compartmental dpp expression maintain relatively normal
rates of cell proliferation and exhibit only mild defects in growth. These
results indicate that during the latter half of larval development, the Dpp
morphogen gradient emanating from the anterior-posterior compartment boundary is 
not directly required for wing disc growth.

Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs), proteins that
recognize short DNA sequence motifs. Such sequences are very common in the human 
genome, and an important determinant of the specificity of gene expression is the
cooperative binding of multiple TFs to closely located motifs. However,
interactions between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized. To
identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their
spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive
affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment
(CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 
TF-TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not
been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously
between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF
pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their
identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were 
predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large
overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of 
composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs.
Together, our results indicate that the DNA molecule commonly plays an active
role in cooperative interactions that define the gene regulatory lexicon.

One of the primary goals of nuclear physics is to understand the force between
nucleons, which is a necessary step for understanding the structure of nuclei and
how nuclei interact with each other. Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus in 
1911, and the large body of knowledge about the nuclear force that has since been
acquired was derived from studies made on nucleons or nuclei. Although antinuclei
up to antihelium-4 have been discovered and their masses measured, little is
known directly about the nuclear force between antinucleons. Here, we study
antiproton pair correlations among data collected by the STAR experiment at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), where gold ions are collided with a
centre-of-mass energy of 200 gigaelectronvolts per nucleon pair. Antiprotons are 
abundantly produced in such collisions, thus making it feasible to study details 
of the antiproton-antiproton interaction. By applying a technique similar to
Hanbury Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry, we show that the force between 
two antiprotons is attractive. In addition, we report two key parameters that
characterize the corresponding strong interaction: the scattering length and the 
effective range of the interaction. Our measured parameters are consistent within
errors with the corresponding values for proton-proton interactions. Our results 
provide direct information on the interaction between two antiprotons, one of the
simplest systems of antinucleons, and so are fundamental to understanding the
structure of more-complex antinuclei and their properties.

Staphylococcus aureus is considered to be an extracellular pathogen. However,
survival of S. aureus within host cells may provide a reservoir relatively
protected from antibiotics, thus enabling long-term colonization of the host and 
explaining clinical failures and relapses after antibiotic therapy. Here we
confirm that intracellular reservoirs of S. aureus in mice comprise a virulent
subset of bacteria that can establish infection even in the presence of
vancomycin, and we introduce a novel therapeutic that effectively kills
intracellular S. aureus. This antibody-antibiotic conjugate consists of an
anti-S. aureus antibody conjugated to a highly efficacious antibiotic that is
activated only after it is released in the proteolytic environment of the
phagolysosome. The antibody-antibiotic conjugate is superior to vancomycin for
treatment of bacteraemia and provides direct evidence that intracellular S.
aureus represents an important component of invasive infections.

Classical sexual selection theory provides a well-supported conceptual framework 
for understanding the evolution and signalling function of male ornaments. It
predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple
mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection should
therefore lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters.
However, females of many species are also highly ornamented. The view that this
is due to a correlated genetic response to selection on males was widely accepted
as an explanation for female ornamentation for over 100 years and current
theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that genetic constraints can limit
sex-specific trait evolution. Alternatively, female ornamentation can be the
outcome of direct selection for signalling needs. Since few studies have explored
interspecific patterns of both male and female elaboration, our understanding of 
the evolution of animal ornamentation remains incomplete, especially over broad
taxonomic scales. Here we use a new method to quantify plumage colour of all
~6,000 species of passerine birds to determine the main evolutionary drivers of
ornamental colouration in both sexes. We found that conspecific male and female
colour elaboration are strongly correlated, suggesting that evolutionary changes 
in one sex are constrained by changes in the other sex. Both sexes are more
ornamented in larger species and in species living in tropical environments.
Ornamentation in females (but not males) is increased in cooperative
breeders--species in which female-female competition for reproductive
opportunities and other resources related to breeding may be high. Finally,
strong sexual selection on males has antagonistic effects, causing an increase in
male colouration but a considerably more pronounced reduction in female
ornamentation. Our results indicate that although there may be genetic
constraints to sexually independent colour evolution, both female and male
ornamentation are strongly and often differentially related to morphological,
social and life-history variables.

The neural crest is an evolutionary novelty that fostered the emergence of
vertebrate anatomical innovations such as the cranium and jaws. During embryonic 
development, multipotent neural crest cells are specified at the lateral borders 
of the neural plate before delaminating, migrating and differentiating into
various cell types. In invertebrate chordates (cephalochordates and tunicates),
neural plate border cells express conserved factors such as Msx, Snail and Pax3/7
and generate melanin-containing pigment cells, a derivative of the neural crest
in vertebrates. However, invertebrate neural plate border cells have not been
shown to generate homologues of other neural crest derivatives. Thus, proposed
models of neural crest evolution postulate vertebrate-specific elaborations on an
ancestral neural plate border program, through acquisition of migratory
capabilities and the potential to generate several cell types. Here we show that 
a particular neuronal cell type in the tadpole larva of the tunicate Ciona
intestinalis, the bipolar tail neuron, shares a set of features with
neural-crest-derived spinal ganglia neurons in vertebrates. Bipolar tail neuron
precursors derive from caudal neural plate border cells, delaminate and migrate
along the paraxial mesoderm on either side of the neural tube, eventually
differentiating into afferent neurons that form synaptic contacts with both
epidermal sensory cells and motor neurons. We propose that the neural plate
borders of the chordate ancestor already produced migratory peripheral neurons
and pigment cells, and that the neural crest evolved through the acquisition of a
multipotent progenitor regulatory state upstream of multiple, pre-existing neural
plate border cell differentiation programs.

Ever since Stephen Paget's 1889 hypothesis, metastatic organotropism has remained
one of cancer's greatest mysteries. Here we demonstrate that exosomes from mouse 
and human lung-, liver- and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially with
resident cells at their predicted destination, namely lung fibroblasts and
epithelial cells, liver Kupffer cells and brain endothelial cells. We show that
tumour-derived exosomes uptaken by organ-specific cells prepare the
pre-metastatic niche. Treatment with exosomes from lung-tropic models redirected 
the metastasis of bone-tropic tumour cells. Exosome proteomics revealed distinct 
integrin expression patterns, in which the exosomal integrins α6β4 and α6β1 were 
associated with lung metastasis, while exosomal integrin αvβ5 was linked to liver
metastasis. Targeting the integrins α6β4 and αvβ5 decreased exosome uptake, as
well as lung and liver metastasis, respectively. We demonstrate that exosome
integrin uptake by resident cells activates Src phosphorylation and
pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression. Finally, our clinical data indicate that
exosomal integrins could be used to predict organ-specific metastasis.

As a cleaner, cheaper, and more globally evenly distributed fuel, natural gas has
considerable environmental, economic, and political advantages over petroleum as 
a source of energy for the transportation sector. Despite these benefits, its low
volumetric energy density at ambient temperature and pressure presents
substantial challenges, particularly for light-duty vehicles with little space
available for on-board fuel storage. Adsorbed natural gas systems have the
potential to store high densities of methane (CH4, the principal component of
natural gas) within a porous material at ambient temperature and moderate
pressures. Although activated carbons, zeolites, and metal-organic frameworks
have been investigated extensively for CH4 storage, there are practical
challenges involved in designing systems with high capacities and in managing the
thermal fluctuations associated with adsorbing and desorbing gas from the
adsorbent. Here, we use a reversible phase transition in a metal-organic
framework to maximize the deliverable capacity of CH4 while also providing
internal heat management during adsorption and desorption. In particular, the
flexible compounds Fe(bdp) and Co(bdp) (bdp(2-) = 1,4-benzenedipyrazolate) are
shown to undergo a structural phase transition in response to specific CH4
pressures, resulting in adsorption and desorption isotherms that feature a sharp 
'step'. Such behaviour enables greater storage capacities than have been achieved
for classical adsorbents, while also reducing the amount of heat released during 
adsorption and the impact of cooling during desorption. The pressure and energy
associated with the phase transition can be tuned either chemically or by
application of mechanical pressure.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger
non-proteolytic ubiquitylation of adjacent chromatin areas to generate binding
sites for DNA repair factors. This depends on the sequential actions of the E3
ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (refs 1-6), and UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), an
E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that specifically generates K63-linked ubiquitin 
chains. Whereas RNF168 is known to catalyse ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, 
leading to the recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 (refs 8-10), the
critical substrates of RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitylation remain elusive. Here we
elucidate how RNF8 and UBC13 promote recruitment of RNF168 and downstream factors
to DSB sites in human cells. We establish that UBC13-dependent K63-linked
ubiquitylation at DSB sites is predominantly mediated by RNF8 but not RNF168, and
that H1-type linker histones, but not core histones, represent major
chromatin-associated targets of this modification. The RNF168 module (UDM1)
recognizing RNF8-generated ubiquitylations is a high-affinity reader of
K63-ubiquitylated H1, mechanistically explaining the essential roles of RNF8 and 
UBC13 in recruiting RNF168 to DSBs. Consistently, reduced expression or chromatin
association of linker histones impair accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitin
conjugates and repair factors at DSB-flanking chromatin. These results identify
histone H1 as a key target of RNF8-UBC13 in DSB signalling and expand the concept
of the histone code by showing that posttranslational modifications of linker
histones can serve as important marks for recognition by factors involved in
genome stability maintenance, and possibly beyond.

Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has a major role in the Earth's nitrogen
cycle and is used in energy-efficient wastewater treatment. This bacterial
process combines nitrite and ammonium to form dinitrogen (N2) gas, and has been
estimated to synthesize up to 50% of the dinitrogen gas emitted into our
atmosphere from the oceans. Strikingly, the anammox process relies on the highly 
unusual, extremely reactive intermediate hydrazine, a compound also used as a
rocket fuel because of its high reducing power. So far, the enzymatic mechanism
by which hydrazine is synthesized is unknown. Here we report the 2.7 Å resolution
crystal structure, as well as biophysical and spectroscopic studies, of a
hydrazine synthase multiprotein complex isolated from the anammox organism
Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. The structure shows an elongated dimer of
heterotrimers, each of which has two unique c-type haem-containing active sites, 
as well as an interaction point for a redox partner. Furthermore, a system of
tunnels connects these active sites. The crystal structure implies a two-step
mechanism for hydrazine synthesis: a three-electron reduction of nitric oxide to 
hydroxylamine at the active site of the γ-subunit and its subsequent condensation
with ammonia, yielding hydrazine in the active centre of the α-subunit. Our
results provide the first, to our knowledge, detailed structural insight into the
mechanism of biological hydrazine synthesis, which is of major significance for
our understanding of the conversion of nitrogenous compounds in nature.

Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) are ubiquitous ion channels
responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) signalling and essential for a broad array of
cellular processes ranging from contraction to secretion, and from proliferation 
to cell death. Despite decades of research on InsP3Rs, a mechanistic
understanding of their structure-function relationship is lacking. Here we
present the first, to our knowledge, near-atomic (4.7 Å) resolution electron
cryomicroscopy structure of the tetrameric mammalian type 1 InsP3R channel in its
apo-state. At this resolution, we are able to trace unambiguously ∼85% of the
protein backbone, allowing us to identify the structural elements involved in
gating and modulation of this 1.3-megadalton channel. Although the central
Ca(2+)-conduction pathway is similar to other ion channels, including the closely
related ryanodine receptor, the cytosolic carboxy termini are uniquely arranged
in a left-handed α-helical bundle, directly interacting with the amino-terminal
domains of adjacent subunits. This configuration suggests a molecular mechanism
for allosteric regulation of channel gating by intracellular signals.

Animals have evolved homeostatic responses to changes in oxygen availability that
act on different timescales. Although the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
transcriptional pathway that controls long-term responses to low oxygen (hypoxia)
has been established, the pathway that mediates acute responses to hypoxia in
mammals is not well understood. Here we show that the olfactory receptor gene
Olfr78 is highly and selectively expressed in oxygen-sensitive glomus cells of
the carotid body, a chemosensory organ at the carotid artery bifurcation that
monitors blood oxygen and stimulates breathing within seconds when oxygen
declines. Olfr78 mutants fail to increase ventilation in hypoxia but respond
normally to hypercapnia. Glomus cells are present in normal numbers and appear
structurally intact, but hypoxia-induced carotid body activity is diminished.
Lactate, a metabolite that rapidly accumulates in hypoxia and induces
hyperventilation, activates Olfr78 in heterologous expression experiments,
induces calcium transients in glomus cells, and stimulates carotid sinus nerve
activity through Olfr78. We propose that, in addition to its role in olfaction,
Olfr78 acts as a hypoxia sensor in the breathing circuit by sensing lactate
produced when oxygen levels decline.

The pressures on honeybee (Apis mellifera) populations, resulting from threats by
modern pesticides, parasites, predators and diseases, have raised awareness of
the economic importance and critical role this insect plays in agricultural
societies across the globe. However, the association of humans with A. mellifera 
predates post-industrial-revolution agriculture, as evidenced by the widespread
presence of ancient Egyptian bee iconography dating to the Old Kingdom
(approximately 2400 BC). There are also indications of Stone Age people
harvesting bee products; for example, honey hunting is interpreted from rock art 
in a prehistoric Holocene context and a beeswax find in a pre-agriculturalist
site. However, when and where the regular association of A. mellifera with
agriculturalists emerged is unknown. One of the major products of A. mellifera is
beeswax, which is composed of a complex suite of lipids including n-alkanes,
n-alkanoic acids and fatty acyl wax esters. The composition is highly constant as
it is determined genetically through the insect's biochemistry. Thus, the
chemical 'fingerprint' of beeswax provides a reliable basis for detecting this
commodity in organic residues preserved at archaeological sites, which we now use
to trace the exploitation by humans of A. mellifera temporally and spatially.
Here we present secure identifications of beeswax in lipid residues preserved in 
pottery vessels of Neolithic Old World farmers. The geographical range of bee
product exploitation is traced in Neolithic Europe, the Near East and North
Africa, providing the palaeoecological range of honeybees during prehistory.
Temporally, we demonstrate that bee products were exploited continuously, and
probably extensively in some regions, at least from the seventh millennium cal
BC, likely fulfilling a variety of technological and cultural functions. The
close association of A. mellifera with Neolithic farming communities dates to the
early onset of agriculture and may provide evidence for the beginnings of a
domestication process.

Scientific theories of how subduction and plate tectonics began on Earth--and
what the tectonic structure of Earth was before this--remain enigmatic and
contentious. Understanding viable scenarios for the onset of subduction and plate
tectonics is hampered by the fact that subduction initiation processes must have 
been markedly different before the onset of global plate tectonics because most
present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and
existing zones of lithospheric weakness, which are both consequences of plate
tectonics. However, plume-induced subduction initiation could have started the
first subduction zone without the help of plate tectonics. Here, we test this
mechanism using high-resolution three-dimensional numerical thermomechanical
modelling. We demonstrate that three key physical factors combine to trigger
self-sustained subduction: (1) a strong, negatively buoyant oceanic lithosphere; 
(2) focused magmatic weakening and thinning of lithosphere above the plume; and
(3) lubrication of the slab interface by hydrated crust. We also show that
plume-induced subduction could only have been feasible in the hotter early Earth 
for old oceanic plates. In contrast, younger plates favoured episodic
lithospheric drips rather than self-sustained subduction and global plate
tectonics.

Porous solids such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks are useful in
molecular separation and in catalysis, but their solid nature can impose
limitations. For example, liquid solvents, rather than porous solids, are the
most mature technology for post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide because
liquid circulation systems are more easily retrofitted to existing plants. Solid 
porous adsorbents offer major benefits, such as lower energy penalties in
adsorption-desorption cycles, but they are difficult to implement in conventional
flow processes. Materials that combine the properties of fluidity and permanent
porosity could therefore offer technological advantages, but permanent porosity
is not associated with conventional liquids. Here we report free-flowing liquids 
whose bulk properties are determined by their permanent porosity. To achieve
this, we designed cage molecules that provide a well-defined pore space and that 
are highly soluble in solvents whose molecules are too large to enter the pores. 
The concentration of unoccupied cages can thus be around 500 times greater than
in other molecular solutions that contain cavities, resulting in a marked change 
in bulk properties, such as an eightfold increase in the solubility of methane
gas. Our results provide the basis for development of a new class of functional
porous materials for chemical processes, and we present a one-step, multigram
scale-up route for highly soluble 'scrambled' porous cages prepared from a
mixture of commercially available reagents. The unifying design principle for
these materials is the avoidance of functional groups that can penetrate into the
molecular cage cavities.

M-dwarf stars--hydrogen-burning stars that are smaller than 60 per cent of the
size of the Sun--are the most common class of star in our Galaxy and outnumber
Sun-like stars by a ratio of 12:1. Recent results have shown that M dwarfs host
Earth-sized planets in great numbers: the average number of M-dwarf planets that 
are between 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of Earth is at least 1.4 per star. The
nearest such planets known to transit their star are 39 parsecs away, too distant
for detailed follow-up observations to measure the planetary masses or to study
their atmospheres. Here we report observations of GJ 1132b, a planet with a size 
of 1.2 Earth radii that is transiting a small star 12 parsecs away. Our Doppler
mass measurement of GJ 1132b yields a density consistent with an Earth-like bulk 
composition, similar to the compositions of the six known exoplanets with masses 
less than six times that of the Earth and precisely measured densities. Receiving
19 times more stellar radiation than the Earth, the planet is too hot to be
habitable but is cool enough to support a substantial atmosphere, one that has
probably been considerably depleted of hydrogen. Because the host star is nearby 
and only 21 per cent the radius of the Sun, existing and upcoming telescopes will
be able to observe the composition and dynamics of the planetary atmosphere.

It is estimated that more than 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C
virus (HCV) worldwide. Clinical trials have demonstrated that, for the first time
in human history, the potential exists to eradicate a chronic viral disease using
combination therapies that contain only direct-acting antiviral agents. HCV
non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) is a multifunctional protein required for
several stages of the virus replication cycle. NS5A replication complex
inhibitors, exemplified by daclatasvir (DCV; also known as BMS-790052 and
Daklinza), belong to the most potent class of direct-acting anti-HCV agents
described so far, with in vitro activity in the picomolar (pM) to low nanomolar
(nM) range. The potency observed in vitro has translated into clinical efficacy, 
with HCV RNA declining by ~3-4 log10 in infected patients after administration of
single oral doses of DCV. Understanding the exceptional potency of DCV was a key 
objective of this study. Here we show that although DCV and an NS5A inhibitor
analogue (Syn-395) are inactive against certain NS5A resistance variants,
combinations of the pair enhance DCV potency by >1,000-fold, restoring activity
to the pM range. This synergistic effect was validated in vivo using an
HCV-infected chimaeric mouse model. The cooperative interaction of a pair of
compounds suggests that NS5A protein molecules communicate with each other: one
inhibitor binds to resistant NS5A, causing a conformational change that is
transmitted to adjacent NS5As, resensitizing resistant NS5A so that the second
inhibitor can act to restore inhibition. This unprecedented synergistic anti-HCV 
activity also enhances the resistance barrier of DCV, providing additional
options for HCV combination therapy and new insight into the role of NS5A in the 
HCV replication cycle.

Anxiety-related conditions are among the most difficult neuropsychiatric diseases
to treat pharmacologically, but respond to cognitive therapies. There has
therefore been interest in identifying relevant top-down pathways from cognitive 
control regions in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Identification of such
pathways could contribute to our understanding of the cognitive regulation of
affect, and provide pathways for intervention. Previous studies have suggested
that dorsal and ventral mPFC subregions exert opposing effects on fear, as do
subregions of other structures. However, precise causal targets for top-down
connections among these diverse possibilities have not been established. Here we 
show that the basomedial amygdala (BMA) represents the major target of ventral
mPFC in amygdala in mice. Moreover, BMA neurons differentiate safe and aversive
environments, and BMA activation decreases fear-related freezing and high-anxiety
states. Lastly, we show that the ventral mPFC-BMA projection implements top-down 
control of anxiety state and learned freezing, both at baseline and in
stress-induced anxiety, defining a broadly relevant new top-down behavioural
regulation pathway.

To advance quantum information science, physical systems are sought that meet the
stringent requirements for creating and preserving quantum entanglement. In
atomic physics, robust two-qubit entanglement is typically achieved by strong,
long-range interactions in the form of either Coulomb interactions between ions
or dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms. Although such interactions allow
fast quantum gates, the interacting atoms must overcome the associated coupling
to the environment and cross-talk among qubits. Local interactions, such as those
requiring substantial wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental
effects; however, such interactions present a new challenge: to distribute
entanglement, qubits must be transported, merged for interaction, and then
isolated for storage and subsequent operations. Here we show how, using a mobile 
optical tweezer, it is possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold
neutral atoms, and then separate them while preserving their entanglement.
Ground-state neutral atom experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin
entanglement, and have detected entanglement with macroscopic observables; we are
now able to demonstrate position-resolved two-particle coherence via application 
of a local gradient and parity measurements. This new entanglement-verification
protocol could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially
separated atoms. The local entangling operation is achieved via spin-exchange
interactions, and quantum tunnelling is used to combine and separate atoms. These
techniques provide a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local
operations within a large-scale quantum register.

Threats to genomic integrity arising from DNA damage are mitigated by DNA
glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway by locating and
excising aberrant nucleobases. How these enzymes find small modifications within 
the genome is a current area of intensive research. A hallmark of these and other
DNA repair enzymes is their use of base flipping to sequester modified
nucleotides from the DNA helix and into an active site pocket. Consequently, base
flipping is generally regarded as an essential aspect of lesion recognition and a
necessary precursor to base excision. Here we present the first, to our
knowledge, DNA glycosylase mechanism that does not require base flipping for
either binding or catalysis. Using the DNA glycosylase AlkD from Bacillus cereus,
we crystallographically monitored excision of an alkylpurine substrate as a
function of time, and reconstructed the steps along the reaction coordinate
through structures representing substrate, intermediate and product complexes.
Instead of directly interacting with the damaged nucleobase, AlkD recognizes
aberrant base pairs through interactions with the phosphoribose backbone, while
the lesion remains stacked in the DNA duplex. Quantum mechanical calculations
revealed that these contacts include catalytic charge-dipole and CH-π
interactions that preferentially stabilize the transition state. We show in vitro
and in vivo how this unique means of recognition and catalysis enables AlkD to
repair large adducts formed by yatakemycin, a member of the duocarmycin family of
antimicrobial natural products exploited in bacterial warfare and
chemotherapeutic trials. Bulky adducts of this or any type are not excised by DNA
glycosylases that use a traditional base-flipping mechanism. Hence, these
findings represent a new model for DNA repair and provide insights into catalysis
of base excision.

Large anomalous Hall effect in a non-collinear antiferromagnet at room
temperature.

In ferromagnetic conductors, an electric current may induce a transverse voltage 
drop in zero applied magnetic field: this anomalous Hall effect is observed to be
proportional to magnetization, and thus is not usually seen in antiferromagnets
in zero field. Recent developments in theory and experiment have provided a
framework for understanding the anomalous Hall effect using Berry-phase concepts,
and this perspective has led to predictions that, under certain conditions, a
large anomalous Hall effect may appear in spin liquids and antiferromagnets
without net spin magnetization. Although such a spontaneous Hall effect has now
been observed in a spin liquid state, a zero-field anomalous Hall effect has
hitherto not been reported for antiferromagnets. Here we report empirical
evidence for a large anomalous Hall effect in an antiferromagnet that has
vanishingly small magnetization. In particular, we find that Mn3Sn, an
antiferromagnet that has a non-collinear 120-degree spin order, exhibits a large 
anomalous Hall conductivity of around 20 per ohm per centimetre at room
temperature and more than 100 per ohm per centimetre at low temperatures,
reaching the same order of magnitude as in ferromagnetic metals. Notably, the
chiral antiferromagnetic state has a very weak and soft ferromagnetic moment of
about 0.002 Bohr magnetons per Mn atom (refs 10, 12), allowing us to switch the
sign of the Hall effect with a small magnetic field of around a few hundred
oersted. This soft response of the large anomalous Hall effect could be useful
for various applications including spintronics--for example, to develop a memory 
device that produces almost no perturbing stray fields.

Epigenetic silencing including histone modifications and DNA methylation is an
important tumorigenic mechanism. However, its role in cancer immunopathology and 
immunotherapy is poorly understood. Using human ovarian cancers as our model,
here we show that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)-mediated histone H3 lysine
27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA
methylation repress the tumour production of T helper 1 (TH1)-type chemokines
CXCL9 and CXCL10, and subsequently determine effector T-cell trafficking to the
tumour microenvironment. Treatment with epigenetic modulators removes the
repression and increases effector T-cell tumour infiltration, slows down tumour
progression, and improves the therapeutic efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1
(PD-L1; also known as B7-H1) checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell transfusion 
in tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, tumour EZH2 and DNMT1 are negatively associated
with tumour-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and patient outcome. Thus, epigenetic
silencing of TH1-type chemokines is a novel immune-evasion mechanism of tumours. 
Selective epigenetic reprogramming alters the T-cell landscape in cancer and may 
enhance the clinical efficacy of cancer therapy.

Growing evidence demonstrates that climatic conditions can have a profound impact
on the functioning of modern human societies, but effects on economic activity
appear inconsistent. Fundamental productive elements of modern economies, such as
workers and crops, exhibit highly non-linear responses to local temperature even 
in wealthy countries. In contrast, aggregate macroeconomic productivity of entire
wealthy countries is reported not to respond to temperature, while poor countries
respond only linearly. Resolving this conflict between micro and macro
observations is critical to understanding the role of wealth in coupled
human-natural systems and to anticipating the global impact of climate change.
Here we unify these seemingly contradictory results by accounting for
non-linearity at the macro scale. We show that overall economic productivity is
non-linear in temperature for all countries, with productivity peaking at an
annual average temperature of 13 °C and declining strongly at higher
temperatures. The relationship is globally generalizable, unchanged since 1960,
and apparent for agricultural and non-agricultural activity in both rich and poor
countries. These results provide the first evidence that economic activity in all
regions is coupled to the global climate and establish a new empirical foundation
for modelling economic loss in response to climate change, with important
implications. If future adaptation mimics past adaptation, unmitigated warming is
expected to reshape the global economy by reducing average global incomes roughly
23% by 2100 and widening global income inequality, relative to scenarios without 
climate change. In contrast to prior estimates, expected global losses are
approximately linear in global mean temperature, with median losses many times
larger than leading models indicate.

Among extant tetrapods, salamanders are unique in showing a reversed preaxial
polarity in patterning of the skeletal elements of the limbs, and in displaying
the highest capacity for regeneration, including full limb and tail regeneration.
These features are particularly striking as tetrapod limb development has
otherwise been shown to be a highly conserved process. It remains elusive whether
the capacity to regenerate limbs in salamanders is mechanistically and
evolutionarily linked to the aberrant pattern of limb development; both are
features classically regarded as unique to urodeles. New molecular data suggest
that salamander-specific orphan genes play a central role in limb regeneration
and may also be involved in the preaxial patterning during limb development. Here
we show that preaxial polarity in limb development was present in various groups 
of temnospondyl amphibians of the Carboniferous and Permian periods, including
the dissorophoids Apateon and Micromelerpeton, as well as the stereospondylomorph
Sclerocephalus. Limb regeneration has also been reported in Micromelerpeton,
demonstrating that both features were already present together in antecedents of 
modern salamanders 290 million years ago. Furthermore, data from lepospondyl
'microsaurs' on the amniote stem indicate that these taxa may have shown some
capacity for limb regeneration and were capable of tail regeneration, including
re-patterning of the caudal vertebral column that is otherwise only seen in
salamander tail regeneration. The data from fossils suggest that salamander-like 
regeneration is an ancient feature of tetrapods that was subsequently lost at
least once in the lineage leading to amniotes. Salamanders are the only modern
tetrapods that retained regenerative capacities as well as preaxial polarity in
limb development.

Eukaryotes rely on efficient distribution of energy and carbon skeletons between 
organs in the form of sugars. Glucose in animals and sucrose in plants serve as
the dominant distribution forms. Cellular sugar uptake and release require
vesicular and/or plasma membrane transport proteins. Humans and plants use
proteins from three superfamilies for sugar translocation: the major facilitator 
superfamily (MFS), the sodium solute symporter family (SSF; only in the animal
kingdom), and SWEETs. SWEETs carry mono- and disaccharides across vacuolar or
plasma membranes. Plant SWEETs play key roles in sugar translocation between
compartments, cells, and organs, notably in nectar secretion, phloem loading for 
long distance translocation, pollen nutrition, and seed filling. Plant SWEETs
cause pathogen susceptibility possibly by sugar leakage from infected cells. The 
vacuolar Arabidopsis thaliana AtSWEET2 sequesters sugars in root vacuoles;
loss-of-function mutants show increased susceptibility to Pythium infection. Here
we show that its orthologue, the vacuolar glucose transporter OsSWEET2b from rice
(Oryza sativa), consists of an asymmetrical pair of triple-helix bundles,
connected by an inversion linker transmembrane helix (TM4) to create the
translocation pathway. Structural and biochemical analyses show OsSWEET2b in an
apparent inward (cytosolic) open state forming homomeric trimers. TM4 tightly
interacts with the first triple-helix bundle within a protomer and mediates key
contacts among protomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the close paralogue
SWEET1 from Arabidopsis identified key residues in substrate translocation and
protomer crosstalk. Insights into the structure-function relationship of SWEETs
are valuable for understanding the transport mechanism of eukaryotic SWEETs and
may be useful for engineering sugar flux.

Solid cancer cells commonly enter the blood and disseminate systemically, but are
highly inefficient at forming distant metastases for poorly understood reasons.
Here we studied human melanomas that differed in their metastasis histories in
patients and in their capacity to metastasize in NOD-SCID-Il2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice. 
We show that melanomas had high frequencies of cells that formed subcutaneous
tumours, but much lower percentages of cells that formed tumours after
intravenous or intrasplenic transplantation, particularly among inefficiently
metastasizing melanomas. Melanoma cells in the blood and visceral organs
experienced oxidative stress not observed in established subcutaneous tumours.
Successfully metastasizing melanomas underwent reversible metabolic changes
during metastasis that increased their capacity to withstand oxidative stress,
including increased dependence on NADPH-generating enzymes in the folate pathway.
Antioxidants promoted distant metastasis in NSG mice. Folate pathway inhibition
using low-dose methotrexate, ALDH1L2 knockdown, or MTHFD1 knockdown inhibited
distant metastasis without significantly affecting the growth of subcutaneous
tumours in the same mice. Oxidative stress thus limits distant metastasis by
melanoma cells in vivo.

Na(+)-activated K(+) channels are members of the Slo family of large conductance 
K(+) channels that are widely expressed in the brain, where their opening
regulates neuronal excitability. These channels fulfil a number of biological
roles and have intriguing biophysical properties, including conductance levels
that are ten times those of most other K(+) channels and gating sensitivity to
intracellular Na(+). Here we present the structure of a complete Na(+)-activated 
K(+) channel, chicken Slo2.2, in the Na(+)-free state, determined by
cryo-electron microscopy at a nominal resolution of 4.5 ångströms. The channel is
composed of a large cytoplasmic gating ring, in which resides the Na(+)-binding
site and a transmembrane domain that closely resembles voltage-gated K(+)
channels. In the structure, the cytoplasmic domain adopts a closed conformation
and the ion conduction pore is also closed. The structure reveals features that
can explain the unusually high conductance of Slo channels and how contraction of
the cytoplasmic gating ring closes the pore.

Enhancers, critical determinants of cellular identity, are commonly recognized by
correlative chromatin marks and gain-of-function potential, although only
loss-of-function studies can demonstrate their requirement in the native genomic 
context. Previously, we identified an erythroid enhancer of human BCL11A, subject
to common genetic variation associated with the fetal haemoglobin level, the
mouse orthologue of which is necessary for erythroid BCL11A expression. Here we
develop pooled clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9
guide RNA libraries to perform in situ saturating mutagenesis of the human and
mouse enhancers. This approach reveals critical minimal features and discrete
vulnerabilities of these enhancers. Despite conserved function of the composite
enhancers, their architecture diverges. The crucial human sequences appear to be 
primate-specific. Through editing of primary human progenitors and mouse
transgenesis, we validate the BCL11A erythroid enhancer as a target for fetal
haemoglobin reinduction. The detailed enhancer map will inform therapeutic genome
editing, and the screening approach described here is generally applicable to
functional interrogation of non-coding genomic elements.

Spontaneous removal of condensed matter from surfaces is exploited in nature and 
in a broad range of technologies to achieve self-cleaning, anti-icing and
condensation control. But despite much progress, our understanding of the
phenomena leading to such behaviour remains incomplete, which makes it
challenging to rationally design surfaces that benefit from its manifestation.
Here we show that water droplets resting on superhydrophobic textured surfaces in
a low-pressure environment can self-remove through sudden spontaneous levitation 
and subsequent trampoline-like bouncing behaviour, in which sequential collisions
with the surface accelerate the droplets. These collisions have restitution
coefficients (ratios of relative speeds after and before collision) greater than 
unity despite complete rigidity of the surface, and thus seemingly violate the
second law of thermodynamics. However, these restitution coefficients result from
an overpressure beneath the droplet produced by fast droplet vaporization while
substrate adhesion and surface texture restrict vapour flow. We also show that
the high vaporization rates experienced by the droplets and the associated
cooling can result in freezing from a supercooled state that triggers a sudden
increase in vaporization, which in turn boosts the levitation process. This
effect can spontaneously remove surface icing by lifting away icy drops the
moment they freeze. Although these observations are relevant only to systems in a
low-pressure environment, they show how surface texturing can produce
droplet-surface interactions that prohibit liquid and freezing water-droplet
retention on surfaces.

The quantum statistics of bosons and fermions manifest themselves in the manner
in which two indistinguishable particles interfere quantum mechanically. When two
photons, which are bosonic particles, enter a beam-splitter with one photon in
each input port, they bunch together at either of the two output ports. The
corresponding disappearance of the coincidence count is the Hong-Ou-Mandel
effect. Here we show the phonon counterpart of this effect in a system of
trapped-ion phonons, which are collective excitations derived by quantizing
vibrational motions that obey Bose-Einstein statistics. We realize a
beam-splitter transformation of the phonons by employing the mutual Coulomb
repulsion between ions, and perform a two-phonon quantum interference experiment 
using that transformation. We observe an almost perfect disappearance of the
phonon coincidence between two ion sites, confirming that phonons can be
considered indistinguishable bosonic particles. The two-particle interference
demonstrated here is purely a quantum effect, without a classical counterpart,
hence it should be possible to demonstrate the existence of entanglement on this 
basis. We attempt to generate an entangled state of phonons at the centre of the 
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip in the coincidence temporal profile, under the assumption that
the entangled phonon state is successfully generated if the fidelity of the
analysis pulses is taken into account adequately. Two-phonon interference, as
demonstrated here, proves the bosonic nature of phonons in a trapped-ion system. 
It opens the way to establishing phonon modes as carriers of quantum information 
in their own right, and could have implications for the quantum simulation of
bosonic particles and analogue quantum computation via boson sampling.

The loss of mass from protostars, in the form of a jet or outflow, is a necessary
counterpart to protostellar mass accretion. Outflow ejection events probably vary
in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. Such 'episodic' ejection
events have been observed during the class 0 protostellar phase (the early
accretion stage), and continue during the subsequent class I phase that marks the
first one million years of star formation. Previously observed episodic-ejection 
sources were relatively isolated; however, the most common sites of star
formation are clusters. Outflows link protostars with their environment and
provide a viable source of the turbulence that is necessary for regulating star
formation in clusters, but it is not known how an accretion-driven jet or outflow
in a clustered environment manifests itself in its earliest stage. This early
stage is important in establishing the initial conditions for momentum and energy
transfer to the environment as the protostar and cluster evolve. Here we report
that an outflow from a young, class 0 protostar, at the hub of the very active
and filamentary Serpens South protostellar cluster, shows unambiguous episodic
events. The (12)C(16)O (J = 2-1) emission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct 
features of outflow ejecta, the most recent having the highest velocity. The
outflow forms bipolar lobes--one of the first detectable signs of star
formation--which originate from the peak of 1-mm continuum emission. Emission
from the surrounding C(18)O envelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation
and an infall of material onto the protostar. The data suggest that episodic,
accretion-driven outflow begins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, 
and that the outflow remains intact in a very clustered environment, probably
providing efficient momentum transfer for driving turbulence.

Over two centuries of economic growth have put undeniable pressure on the
ecological systems that underpin human well-being. While it is agreed that these 
pressures are increasing, views divide on how they may be alleviated. Some
suggest technological advances will automatically keep us from transgressing key 
environmental thresholds; others that policy reform can reconcile economic and
ecological goals; while a third school argues that only a fundamental shift in
societal values can keep human demands within the Earth's ecological limits. Here
we use novel integrated analysis of the energy-water-food nexus, rural land use
(including biodiversity), material flows and climate change to explore whether
mounting ecological pressures in Australia can be reversed, while the population 
grows and living standards improve. We show that, in the right circumstances,
economic and environmental outcomes can be decoupled. Although economic growth is
strong across all scenarios, environmental performance varies widely: pressures
are projected to more than double, stabilize or fall markedly by 2050. However,
we find no evidence that decoupling will occur automatically. Nor do we find that
a shift in societal values is required. Rather, extensions of current policies
that mobilize technology and incentivize reduced pressure account for the
majority of differences in environmental performance. Our results show that
Australia can make great progress towards sustainable prosperity, if it chooses
to do so.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic membrane
trafficking process that degrades a variety of cellular constituents and is
associated with human diseases. Although extensive studies have focused on
autophagic turnover of cytoplasmic materials, little is known about the role of
autophagy in degrading nuclear components. Here we report that the autophagy
machinery mediates degradation of nuclear lamina components in mammals. The
autophagy protein LC3/Atg8, which is involved in autophagy membrane trafficking
and substrate delivery, is present in the nucleus and directly interacts with the
nuclear lamina protein lamin B1, and binds to lamin-associated domains on
chromatin. This LC3-lamin B1 interaction does not downregulate lamin B1 during
starvation, but mediates its degradation upon oncogenic insults, such as by
activated RAS. Lamin B1 degradation is achieved by nucleus-to-cytoplasm transport
that delivers lamin B1 to the lysosome. Inhibiting autophagy or the LC3-lamin B1 
interaction prevents activated RAS-induced lamin B1 loss and attenuates
oncogene-induced senescence in primary human cells. Our study suggests that this 
new function of autophagy acts as a guarding mechanism protecting cells from
tumorigenesis.

Bipolar disorder is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder that is characterized by 
intermittent episodes of mania and depression; without treatment, 15% of patients
commit suicide. Hence, it has been ranked by the World Health Organization as a
top disorder of morbidity and lost productivity. Previous neuropathological
studies have revealed a series of alterations in the brains of patients with
bipolar disorder or animal models, such as reduced glial cell number in the
prefrontal cortex of patients, upregulated activities of the protein kinase A and
C pathways and changes in neurotransmission. However, the roles and causation of 
these changes in bipolar disorder have been too complex to exactly determine the 
pathology of the disease. Furthermore, although some patients show remarkable
improvement with lithium treatment for yet unknown reasons, others are refractory
to lithium treatment. Therefore, developing an accurate and powerful biological
model for bipolar disorder has been a challenge. The introduction of induced
pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) technology has provided a new approach. Here we have
developed an iPSC model for human bipolar disorder and investigated the cellular 
phenotypes of hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons derived from iPSCs of
patients with bipolar disorder. Guided by RNA sequencing expression profiling, we
have detected mitochondrial abnormalities in young neurons from patients with
bipolar disorder by using mitochondrial assays; in addition, using both
patch-clamp recording and somatic Ca(2+) imaging, we have observed hyperactive
action-potential firing. This hyperexcitability phenotype of young neurons in
bipolar disorder was selectively reversed by lithium treatment only in neurons
derived from patients who also responded to lithium treatment. Therefore,
hyperexcitability is one early endophenotype of bipolar disorder, and our model
of iPSCs in this disease might be useful in developing new therapies and drugs
aimed at its clinical treatment.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification. Ten-eleven translocation
(TET) proteins are involved in DNA demethylation through iteratively oxidizing
5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine
(5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Here we show that human TET1 and TET2 are
more active on 5mC-DNA than 5hmC/5fC-DNA substrates. We determine the crystal
structures of TET2-5hmC-DNA and TET2-5fC-DNA complexes at 1.80 Å and 1.97 Å
resolution, respectively. The cytosine portion of 5hmC/5fC is specifically
recognized by TET2 in a manner similar to that of 5mC in the TET2-5mC-DNA
structure, and the pyrimidine base of 5mC/5hmC/5fC adopts an almost identical
conformation within the catalytic cavity. However, the hydroxyl group of 5hmC and
carbonyl group of 5fC face towards the opposite direction because the
hydroxymethyl group of 5hmC and formyl group of 5fC adopt restrained
conformations through forming hydrogen bonds with the 1-carboxylate of NOG and N4
exocyclic nitrogen of cytosine, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that 
the substrate preference of TET2 results from the different efficiencies of
hydrogen abstraction in TET2-mediated oxidation. The restrained conformation of
5hmC and 5fC within the catalytic cavity may prevent their abstractable
hydrogen(s) adopting a favourable orientation for hydrogen abstraction and thus
result in low catalytic efficiency. Our studies demonstrate that the substrate
preference of TET2 results from the intrinsic value of its substrates at their
5mC derivative groups and suggest that 5hmC is relatively stable and less prone
to further oxidation by TET proteins. Therefore, TET proteins are evolutionarily 
tuned to be less reactive towards 5hmC and facilitate the generation of 5hmC as a
potentially stable mark for regulatory functions.

Cas9 is an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease that targets foreign DNA for destruction
as part of a bacterial adaptive immune system mediated by clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). Together with single-guide RNAs, 
Cas9 also functions as a powerful genome engineering tool in plants and animals, 
and efforts are underway to increase the efficiency and specificity of DNA
targeting for potential therapeutic applications. Studies of off-target effects
have shown that DNA binding is far more promiscuous than DNA cleavage, yet the
molecular cues that govern strand scission have not been elucidated. Here we show
that the conformational state of the HNH nuclease domain directly controls DNA
cleavage activity. Using intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer
experiments to detect relative orientations of the Cas9 catalytic domains when
associated with on- and off-target DNA, we find that DNA cleavage efficiencies
scale with the extent to which the HNH domain samples an activated conformation. 
We furthermore uncover a surprising mode of allosteric communication that ensures
concerted firing of both Cas9 nuclease domains. Our results highlight a
proofreading mechanism beyond initial protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)
recognition and RNA-DNA base-pairing that serves as a final specificity
checkpoint before DNA double-strand break formation.

Rhodium-catalysed syn-carboamination of alkenes via a transient directing group.

Alkenes are the most ubiquitous prochiral functional groups--those that can be
converted from achiral to chiral in a single step--that are accessible to
synthetic chemists. For this reason, difunctionalization reactions of alkenes
(whereby two functional groups are added to the same double bond) are
particularly important, as they can be used to produce highly complex molecular
architectures. Stereoselective oxidation reactions, including dihydroxylation,
aminohydroxylation and halogenation, are well established methods for
functionalizing alkenes. However, the intermolecular incorporation of both
carbon- and nitrogen-based functionalities stereoselectively across an alkene has
not been reported. Here we describe the rhodium-catalysed carboamination of
alkenes at the same (syn) face of a double bond, initiated by a carbon-hydrogen
activation event that uses enoxyphthalimides as the source of both the carbon and
the nitrogen functionalities. The reaction methodology allows for the
intermolecular, stereospecific formation of one carbon-carbon and one
carbon-nitrogen bond across an alkene, which is, to our knowledge, unprecedented.
The reaction design involves the in situ generation of a bidentate directing
group and the use of a new cyclopentadienyl ligand to control the reactivity of
rhodium. The results provide a new way of synthesizing functionalized alkenes,
and should lead to the convergent and stereoselective assembly of
amine-containing acyclic molecules.

Negative-sense RNA viruses, such as influenza, encode large, multidomain
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that can both transcribe and replicate the viral
RNA genome. In influenza virus, the polymerase (FluPol) is composed of three
polypeptides: PB1, PB2 and PA/P3. PB1 houses the polymerase active site, whereas 
PB2 and PA/P3 contain, respectively, cap-binding and endonuclease domains
required for transcription initiation by cap-snatching. Replication occurs
through de novo initiation and involves a complementary RNA intermediate.
Currently available structures of the influenza A and B virus polymerases include
promoter RNA (the 5' and 3' termini of viral genome segments), showing FluPol in 
transcription pre-initiation states. Here we report the structure of apo-FluPol
from an influenza C virus, solved by X-ray crystallography to 3.9 Å, revealing a 
new 'closed' conformation. The apo-FluPol forms a compact particle with PB1 at
its centre, capped on one face by PB2 and clamped between the two globular
domains of P3. Notably, this structure is radically different from those of
promoter-bound FluPols. The endonuclease domain of P3 and the domains within the 
carboxy-terminal two-thirds of PB2 are completely rearranged. The cap-binding
site is occluded by PB2, resulting in a conformation that is incompatible with
transcription initiation. Thus, our structure captures FluPol in a closed,
transcription pre-activation state. This reveals the conformation of newly made
apo-FluPol in an infected cell, but may also apply to FluPol in the context of a 
non-transcribing ribonucleoprotein complex. Comparison of the apo-FluPol
structure with those of promoter-bound FluPols allows us to propose a mechanism
for FluPol activation. Our study demonstrates the remarkable flexibility of
influenza virus RNA polymerase, and aids our understanding of the mechanisms
controlling transcription and genome replication.

The study of bacterial ion channels has provided fundamental insights into the
structural basis of neuronal signalling; however, the native role of ion channels
in bacteria has remained elusive. Here we show that ion channels conduct
long-range electrical signals within bacterial biofilm communities through
spatially propagating waves of potassium. These waves result from a positive
feedback loop, in which a metabolic trigger induces release of intracellular
potassium, which in turn depolarizes neighbouring cells. Propagating through the 
biofilm, this wave of depolarization coordinates metabolic states among cells in 
the interior and periphery of the biofilm. Deletion of the potassium channel
abolishes this response. As predicted by a mathematical model, we further show
that spatial propagation can be hindered by specific genetic perturbations to
potassium channel gating. Together, these results demonstrate a function for ion 
channels in bacterial biofilms, and provide a prokaryotic paradigm for active,
long-range electrical signalling in cellular communities.

For renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric to be
effectively used in the grid of the future, flexible and scalable energy-storage 
solutions are necessary to mitigate output fluctuations. Redox-flow batteries
(RFBs) were first built in the 1940s and are considered a promising large-scale
energy-storage technology. A limited number of redox-active materials--mainly
metal salts, corrosive halogens, and low-molar-mass organic compounds--have been 
investigated as active materials, and only a few membrane materials, such as
Nafion, have been considered for RFBs. However, for systems that are intended for
both domestic and large-scale use, safety and cost must be taken into account as 
well as energy density and capacity, particularly regarding long-term access to
metal resources, which places limits on the lithium-ion-based and vanadium-based 
RFB development. Here we describe an affordable, safe, and scalable battery
system, which uses organic polymers as the charge-storage material in combination
with inexpensive dialysis membranes, which separate the anode and the cathode by 
the retention of the non-metallic, active (macro-molecular) species, and an
aqueous sodium chloride solution as the electrolyte. This water- and
polymer-based RFB has an energy density of 10 watt hours per litre, current
densities of up to 100 milliamperes per square centimetre, and stable long-term
cycling capability. The polymer-based RFB we present uses an environmentally
benign sodium chloride solution and cheap, commercially available filter
membranes instead of highly corrosive acid electrolytes and expensive membrane
materials.

The development of life-threatening cancer metastases at distant organs requires 
disseminated tumour cells' adaptation to, and co-evolution with, the drastically 
different microenvironments of metastatic sites. Cancer cells of common origin
manifest distinct gene expression patterns after metastasizing to different
organs. Clearly, the dynamic interaction between metastatic tumour cells and
extrinsic signals at individual metastatic organ sites critically effects the
subsequent metastatic outgrowth. Yet, it is unclear when and how disseminated
tumour cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of metastatic
organs that prime their subsequent outgrowth. Here we show that both human and
mouse tumour cells with normal expression of PTEN, an important tumour
suppressor, lose PTEN expression after dissemination to the brain, but not to
other organs. The PTEN level in PTEN-loss brain metastatic tumour cells is
restored after leaving the brain microenvironment. This brain
microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN messenger RNA and protein
downregulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs from brain astrocytes.
Mechanistically, astrocyte-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of 
PTEN-targeting microRNAs to metastatic tumour cells, while astrocyte-specific
depletion of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte exosome secretion 
rescues the PTEN loss and suppresses brain metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, this 
adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumour cells leads to an increased
secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits IBA1-expressing myeloid cells
that reciprocally enhance the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumour cells via
enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a
remarkable plasticity of PTEN expression in metastatic tumour cells in response
to different organ microenvironments, underpinning an essential role of
co-evolution between the metastatic cells and their microenvironment during the
adaptive metastatic outgrowth. Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal
cross-talk between tumour cells and the metastatic niche; importantly, they
provide new opportunities for effective anti-metastasis therapies, especially of 
consequence for brain metastasis patients.

Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many transcription factors 
activate in dynamic, and often stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, 
it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of
these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell
time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile
transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes
through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and
repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or
non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with 
only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. 
Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit
sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between
pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of
combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is
common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could
also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.

The adult sex ratio (ASR) has critical effects on behaviour, ecology and
population dynamics, but the causes of variation in ASRs are unclear. Here we
assess whether the type of genetic sex determination influences the ASR using
data from 344 species in 117 families of tetrapods. We show that taxa with female
heterogamety have a significantly more male-biased ASR (proportion of males: 0.55
± 0.01 (mean ± s.e.m.)) than taxa with male heterogamety (0.43 ± 0.01). The
genetic sex-determination system explains 24% of interspecific variation in ASRs 
in amphibians and 36% in reptiles. We consider several genetic factors that could
contribute to this pattern, including meiotic drive and sex-linked deleterious
mutations, but further work is needed to quantify their effects. Regardless of
the mechanism, the effects of the genetic sex-determination system on the adult
sex ratio are likely to have profound effects on the demography and social
behaviour of tetrapods.

Piezo proteins are evolutionarily conserved and functionally diverse
mechanosensitive cation channels. However, the overall structural architecture
and gating mechanisms of Piezo channels have remained unknown. Here we determine 
the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the full-length (2,547 amino acids)
mouse Piezo1 (Piezo1) at a resolution of 4.8 Å. Piezo1 forms a trimeric
propeller-like structure (about 900 kilodalton), with the extracellular domains
resembling three distal blades and a central cap. The transmembrane region has 14
apparently resolved segments per subunit. These segments form three peripheral
wings and a central pore module that encloses a potential ion-conducting pore.
The rather flexible extracellular blade domains are connected to the central
intracellular domain by three long beam-like structures. This trimeric
architecture suggests that Piezo1 may use its peripheral regions as force sensors
to gate the central ion-conducting pore.

Ice flow along land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) varies
considerably in response to fluctuating inputs of surface meltwater to the bed of
the ice sheet. Such inputs lubricate the ice-bed interface, transiently speeding 
up the flow of ice. Greater melting results in faster ice motion during summer,
but slower motion over the subsequent winter, owing to the evolution of an
efficient drainage system that enables water to drain from regions of the
ice-sheet bed that have a high basal water pressure. However, the impact of
hydrodynamic coupling on ice motion over decadal timescales remains poorly
constrained. Here we show that annual ice motion across an 8,000-km(2)
land-terminating region of the west GIS margin, extending to 1,100 m above sea
level, was 12% slower in 2007-14 compared with 1985-94, despite a 50% increase in
surface meltwater production. Our findings suggest that, over these three
decades, hydrodynamic coupling in this section of the ablation zone resulted in a
net slowdown of ice motion (not a speed-up, as previously postulated). Increases 
in meltwater production from projected climate warming may therefore further
reduce the motion of land-terminating margins of the GIS. Our findings suggest
that these sectors of the ice sheet are more resilient to the dynamic impacts of 
enhanced meltwater production than previously thought.

Reactions based on transition metals have found wide use in organic synthesis, in
particular for the functionalization of small molecules. However, there are very 
few reports of using transition-metal-based reactions to modify complex
biomolecules, which is due to the need for stringent reaction conditions (for
example, aqueous media, low temperature and mild pH) and the existence of
multiple reactive functional groups found in biomolecules. Here we report that
palladium(II) complexes can be used for efficient and highly selective cysteine
conjugation (bioconjugation) reactions that are rapid and robust under a range of
bio-compatible reaction conditions. The straightforward synthesis of the
palladium reagents from diverse and easily accessible aryl halide and
trifluoromethanesulfonate precursors makes the method highly practical, providing
access to a large structural space for protein modification. The resulting aryl
bioconjugates are stable towards acids, bases, oxidants and external thiol
nucleophiles. The broad utility of the bioconjugation platform was further
corroborated by the synthesis of new classes of stapled peptides and
antibody-drug conjugates. These palladium complexes show potential as benchtop
reagents for diverse bioconjugation applications.

The composition of the neutral gas comas of most comets is dominated by H2O, CO
and CO2, typically comprising as much as 95 per cent of the total gas density. In
addition, cometary comas have been found to contain a rich array of other
molecules, including sulfuric compounds and complex hydrocarbons. Molecular
oxygen (O2), however, despite its detection on other icy bodies such as the moons
of Jupiter and Saturn, has remained undetected in cometary comas. Here we report 
in situ measurement of O2 in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, with
local abundances ranging from one per cent to ten per cent relative to H2O and
with a mean value of 3.80 ± 0.85 per cent. Our observations indicate that the
O2/H2O ratio is isotropic in the coma and does not change systematically with
heliocentric distance. This suggests that primordial O2 was incorporated into the
nucleus during the comet's formation, which is unexpected given the low upper
limits from remote sensing observations. Current Solar System formation models do
not predict conditions that would allow this to occur.

and cancer.

The gut epithelium has remarkable self-renewal capacity that under homeostatic
conditions is driven by Wnt signalling in Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs).
However, the mechanisms underlying ISC regeneration after injury remain poorly
understood. The Hippo signalling pathway mediates tissue growth and is important 
for regeneration. Here we demonstrate in mice that Yap, a downstream
transcriptional effector of Hippo, is critical for recovery of intestinal
epithelium after exposure to ionizing radiation. Yap transiently reprograms
Lgr5(+) ISCs by suppressing Wnt signalling and excessive Paneth cell
differentiation, while promoting cell survival and inducing a regenerative
program that includes Egf pathway activation. Accordingly, growth of
Yap-deficient organoids is rescued by the Egfr ligand epiregulin, and we find
that non-cell-autonomous production of stromal epiregulin may compensate for Yap 
loss in vivo. Consistent with key roles for regenerative signalling in
tumorigenesis, we further demonstrate that Yap inactivation abolishes adenomas in
the Apc(Min) mouse model of colon cancer, and that Yap-driven expansion of
Apc(-/-) organoids requires the Egfr module of the Yap regenerative program.
Finally, we show that in vivo Yap is required for progression of early Apc mutant
tumour-initiating cells, suppresses their differentiation into Paneth cells, and 
induces a regenerative program and Egfr signalling. Our studies reveal that upon 
tissue injury, Yap reprograms Lgr5(+) ISCs by inhibiting the Wnt homeostatic
program, while inducing a regenerative program that includes activation of Egfr
signalling. Moreover, our findings reveal a key role for the Yap regenerative
pathway in driving cancer initiation.

How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses distractors is
unknown. Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in
executive function, its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention
have been hypothesized to control sensory selection. To test this idea and, more 
generally, dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a
cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this
cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally
precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting
visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical
manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions
with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we
found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit
PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN 
activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic
manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and
intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically
controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments
introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases
thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting
appropriate inputs for further processing.

Selective neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which,
counterintuitively, are often caused by mutations in widely expressed genes.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common hereditary peripheral
neuropathies, for which there are no effective therapies. A subtype of these
diseases--CMT type 2D (CMT2D)--is caused by dominant mutations in GARS, encoding 
the ubiquitously expressed enzyme glycyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (GlyRS). 
Despite the broad requirement of GlyRS for protein biosynthesis in all cells,
mutations in this gene cause a selective degeneration of peripheral axons,
leading to deficits in distal motor function. How mutations in GlyRS
(GlyRS(CMT2D)) are linked to motor neuron vulnerability has remained elusive.
Here we report that GlyRS(CMT2D) acquires a neomorphic binding activity that
directly antagonizes an essential signalling pathway for motor neuron survival.
We find that CMT2D mutations alter the conformation of GlyRS, enabling
GlyRS(CMT2D) to bind the neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) receptor. This aberrant interaction 
competitively interferes with the binding of the cognate ligand vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Nrp1. Genetic reduction of Nrp1 in mice
worsens CMT2D symptoms, whereas enhanced expression of VEGF improves motor
function. These findings link the selective pathology of CMT2D to the neomorphic 
binding activity of GlyRS(CMT2D) that antagonizes the VEGF-Nrp1 interaction, and 
indicate that the VEGF-Nrp1 signalling axis is an actionable target for treating 
CMT2D.

More than 50 years ago, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys
locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory: in any 
local-realist theory, the correlations between outcomes of measurements on
distant particles satisfy an inequality that can be violated if the particles are
entangled. Numerous Bell inequality tests have been reported; however, all
experiments reported so far required additional assumptions to obtain a
contradiction with local realism, resulting in 'loopholes'. Here we report a Bell
experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests
the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We use an event-ready scheme that
enables the generation of robust entanglement between distant electron spins
(estimated state fidelity of 0.92 ± 0.03). Efficient spin read-out avoids the
fair-sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random-basis
selection and spin read-out combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 kilometres 
ensure the required locality conditions. We performed 245 trials that tested the 
CHSH-Bell inequality S ≤ 2 and found S = 2.42 ± 0.20 (where S quantifies the
correlation between measurement outcomes). A null-hypothesis test yields a
probability of at most P = 0.039 that a local-realist model for space-like
separated sites could produce data with a violation at least as large as we
observe, even when allowing for memory in the devices. Our data hence imply
statistically significant rejection of the local-realist null hypothesis. This
conclusion may be further consolidated in future experiments; for instance,
reaching a value of P = 0.001 would require approximately 700 trials for an
observed S = 2.4. With improvements, our experiment could be used for testing
less-conventional theories, and for implementing device-independent
quantum-secure communication and randomness certification.

Enterococcus faecalis is both a common commensal of the human gastrointestinal
tract and a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. Systemic infections
with multidrug-resistant enterococci occur subsequent to gastrointestinal
colonization. Preventing colonization by multidrug-resistant E. faecalis could
therefore be a valuable approach towards limiting infection. However, little is
known about the mechanisms E. faecalis uses to colonize and compete for stable
gastrointestinal niches. Pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids encoding
bacteriocins are common among enterococcal strains and could modulate niche
competition among enterococci or between enterococci and the intestinal
microbiota. We developed a model of colonization of the mouse gut with E.
faecalis, without disrupting the microbiota, to evaluate the role of the
conjugative plasmid pPD1 expressing bacteriocin 21 (ref. 4) in enterococcal
colonization. Here we show that E. faecalis harbouring pPD1 replaces indigenous
enterococci and outcompetes E. faecalis lacking pPD1. Furthermore, in the
intestine, pPD1 is transferred to other E. faecalis strains by conjugation,
enhancing their survival. Colonization with an E. faecalis strain carrying a
conjugation-defective pPD1 mutant subsequently resulted in clearance of
vancomycin-resistant enterococci, without plasmid transfer. Therefore,
bacteriocin expression by commensal bacteria can influence niche competition in
the gastrointestinal tract, and bacteriocins, delivered by commensals that occupy
a precise intestinal bacterial niche, may be an effective therapeutic approach to
specifically eliminate intestinal colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria,
without profound disruption of the indigenous microbiota.

Neuroblastoma is a malignant paediatric tumour of the sympathetic nervous system.
Roughly half of these tumours regress spontaneously or are cured by limited
therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavourable clinical
course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has
remained largely elusive. Here we have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56
neuroblastomas (high-risk, n = 39; low-risk, n = 17) and discovered recurrent
genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region at 5p15.33 proximal of the 
telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only 
in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in a mutually exclusive fashion with
MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this
tumour type. In an extended case series (n = 217), TERT rearrangements defined a 
subgroup of high-risk tumours with particularly poor outcome. Despite a large
structural diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive
transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumours, TERT
expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumours, whereas alternative
lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN
alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism 
defining this subtype. The 5p15.33 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding
sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodelling 
and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT,
neuroblastoma cell lines bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both 
upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our
findings show that remodelling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional
silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in 
the centre of transformation in a large fraction of these tumours.

The hominin record from southern Asia for the early Late Pleistocene epoch is
scarce. Well-dated and well-preserved fossils older than ∼45,000 years that can
be unequivocally attributed to Homo sapiens are lacking. Here we present evidence
from the newly excavated Fuyan Cave in Daoxian (southern China). This site has
provided 47 human teeth dated to more than 80,000 years old, and with an inferred
maximum age of 120,000 years. The morphological and metric assessment of this
sample supports its unequivocal assignment to H. sapiens. The Daoxian sample is
more derived than any other anatomically modern humans, resembling middle-to-late
Late Pleistocene specimens and even contemporary humans. Our study shows that
fully modern morphologies were present in southern China 30,000-70,000 years
earlier than in the Levant and Europe. Our data fill a chronological and
geographical gap that is relevant for understanding when H. sapiens first
appeared in southern Asia. The Daoxian teeth also support the hypothesis that
during the same period, southern China was inhabited by more derived populations 
than central and northern China. This evidence is important for the study of
dispersal routes of modern humans. Finally, our results are relevant to exploring
the reasons for the relatively late entry of H. sapiens into Europe. Some studies
have investigated how the competition with H. sapiens may have caused
Neanderthals' extinction (see ref. 8 and references therein). Notably, although
fully modern humans were already present in southern China at least as early as
∼80,000 years ago, there is no evidence that they entered Europe before ∼45,000
years ago. This could indicate that H. neanderthalensis was indeed an additional 
ecological barrier for modern humans, who could only enter Europe when the demise
of Neanderthals had already started.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) has crucial roles in fatty acid metabolism and is an
attractive target for drug discovery against diabetes, cancer and other diseases.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACC (ScACC) is crucial for the production of
very-long-chain fatty acids and the maintenance of the nuclear envelope. ACC
contains biotin carboxylase (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT) activities, and its
biotin is linked covalently to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Most
eukaryotic ACCs are 250-kilodalton (kDa), multi-domain enzymes and function as
homodimers and higher oligomers. They contain a unique, 80-kDa central region
that shares no homology with other proteins. Although the structures of the BC,
CT and BCCP domains and other biotin-dependent carboxylase holoenzymes are known,
there is currently no structural information on the ACC holoenzyme. Here we
report the crystal structure of the full-length, 500-kDa holoenzyme dimer of
ScACC. The structure is remarkably different from that of the other
biotin-dependent carboxylases. The central region contains five domains and is
important for positioning the BC and CT domains for catalysis. The structure
unexpectedly reveals a dimer of the BC domain and extensive conformational
differences compared to the structure of the BC domain alone, which is a monomer.
These structural changes reveal why the BC domain alone is catalytically inactive
and define the molecular mechanism for the inhibition of eukaryotic ACC by the
natural product soraphen A and by phosphorylation of a Ser residue just before
the BC domain core in mammalian ACC. The BC and CT active sites are separated by 
80 Å, and the entire BCCP domain must translocate during catalysis.

Top-down prefrontal cortex inputs to the hippocampus have been hypothesized to be
important in memory consolidation, retrieval, and the pathophysiology of major
psychiatric diseases; however, no such direct projections have been identified
and functionally described. Here we report the discovery of a monosynaptic
prefrontal cortex (predominantly anterior cingulate) to hippocampus (CA3 to CA1
region) projection in mice, and find that optogenetic manipulation of this
projection (here termed AC-CA) is capable of eliciting contextual memory
retrieval. To explore the network mechanisms of this process, we developed and
applied tools to observe cellular-resolution neural activity in the hippocampus
while stimulating AC-CA projections during memory retrieval in mice behaving in
virtual-reality environments. Using this approach, we found that learning drives 
the emergence of a sparse class of neurons in CA2/CA3 that are highly correlated 
with the local network and that lead synchronous population activity events;
these neurons are then preferentially recruited by the AC-CA projection during
memory retrieval. These findings reveal a sparsely implemented memory retrieval
mechanism in the hippocampus that operates via direct top-down prefrontal input, 
with implications for the patterning and storage of salient memory
representations.

Riboswitches are non-coding RNA structures located in messenger RNAs that bind
endogenous ligands, such as a specific metabolite or ion, to regulate gene
expression. As such, riboswitches serve as a novel, yet largely unexploited,
class of emerging drug targets. Demonstrating this potential, however, has proven
difficult and is restricted to structurally similar antimetabolites and
semi-synthetic analogues of their cognate ligand, thus greatly restricting the
chemical space and selectivity sought for such inhibitors. Here we report the
discovery and characterization of ribocil, a highly selective chemical modulator 
of bacterial riboflavin riboswitches, which was identified in a phenotypic screen
and acts as a structurally distinct synthetic mimic of the natural ligand, flavin
mononucleotide, to repress riboswitch-mediated ribB gene expression and inhibit
bacterial cell growth. Our findings indicate that non-coding RNA structural
elements may be more broadly targeted by synthetic small molecules than
previously expected.

Intracellular lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria including
Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Burkholderia
thailandensis activates mouse caspase-11, causing pyroptotic cell death,
interleukin-1β processing, and lethal septic shock. How caspase-11 executes these
downstream signalling events is largely unknown. Here we show that gasdermin D is
essential for caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis and interleukin-1β maturation. A
forward genetic screen with ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized mice links Gsdmd to
the intracellular lipopolysaccharide response. Macrophages from Gsdmd(-/-) mice
generated by gene targeting also exhibit defective pyroptosis and interleukin-1β 
secretion induced by cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharide or Gram-negative bacteria. In
addition, Gsdmd(-/-) mice are protected from a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide.
Mechanistically, caspase-11 cleaves gasdermin D, and the resulting amino-terminal
fragment promotes both pyroptosis and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 in 
a cell-intrinsic manner. Our data identify gasdermin D as a critical target of
caspase-11 and a key mediator of the host response against Gram-negative
bacteria.

Inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, -4, -5 and -11) are critical for innate
defences. Caspase-1 is activated by ligands of various canonical inflammasomes,
and caspase-4, -5 and -11 directly recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharide, both
of which trigger pyroptosis. Despite the crucial role in immunity and endotoxic
shock, the mechanism for pyroptosis induction by inflammatory caspases is
unknown. Here we identify gasdermin D (Gsdmd) by genome-wide clustered regularly 
interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 nuclease screens of caspase-11- and 
caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis in mouse bone marrow macrophages. GSDMD-deficient
cells resisted the induction of pyroptosis by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide and
known canonical inflammasome ligands. Interleukin-1β release was also diminished 
in Gsdmd(-/-) cells, despite intact processing by caspase-1. Caspase-1 and
caspase-4/5/11 specifically cleaved the linker between the amino-terminal
gasdermin-N and carboxy-terminal gasdermin-C domains in GSDMD, which was required
and sufficient for pyroptosis. The cleavage released the intramolecular
inhibition on the gasdermin-N domain that showed intrinsic pyroptosis-inducing
activity. Other gasdermin family members were not cleaved by inflammatory
caspases but shared the autoinhibition; gain-of-function mutations in Gsdma3 that
cause alopecia and skin defects disrupted the autoinhibition, allowing its
gasdermin-N domain to trigger pyroptosis. These findings offer insight into
inflammasome-mediated immunity/diseases and also change our understanding of
pyroptosis and programmed necrosis.

The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) with sulfate controls the emission of
the greenhouse gas methane from the ocean floor. In marine sediments, AOM is
performed by dual-species consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME)
and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) inhabiting the methane-sulfate transition
zone. The biochemical pathways and biological adaptations enabling this globally 
relevant process are not fully understood. Here we study the syntrophic
interaction in thermophilic AOM (TAOM) between ANME-1 archaea and their
consortium partner SRB HotSeep-1 (ref. 6) at 60 °C to test the hypothesis of a
direct interspecies exchange of electrons. The activity of TAOM consortia was
compared to the first ANME-free culture of an AOM partner bacterium that grows
using hydrogen as the sole electron donor. The thermophilic ANME-1 do not produce
sufficient hydrogen to sustain the observed growth of the HotSeep-1 partner.
Enhancing the growth of the HotSeep-1 partner by hydrogen addition represses
methane oxidation and the metabolic activity of ANME-1. Further supporting the
hypothesis of direct electron transfer between the partners, we observe that
under TAOM conditions, both ANME and the HotSeep-1 bacteria overexpress genes for
extracellular cytochrome production and form cell-to-cell connections that
resemble the nanowire structures responsible for interspecies electron transfer
between syntrophic consortia of Geobacter. HotSeep-1 highly expresses genes for
pili production only during consortial growth using methane, and the
nanowire-like structures are absent in HotSeep-1 cells isolated with hydrogen.
These observations suggest that direct electron transfer is a principal mechanism
in TAOM, which may also explain the enigmatic functioning and specificity of
other methanotrophic ANME-SRB consortia.

Over a century of research into the origin of turbulence in wall-bounded shear
flows has resulted in a puzzling picture in which turbulence appears in a variety
of different states competing with laminar background flow. At moderate flow
speeds, turbulence is confined to localized patches; it is only at higher speeds 
that the entire flow becomes turbulent. The origin of the different states
encountered during this transition, the front dynamics of the turbulent regions
and the transformation to full turbulence have yet to be explained. By combining 
experiments, theory and computer simulations, here we uncover a bifurcation
scenario that explains the transformation to fully turbulent pipe flow and
describe the front dynamics of the different states encountered in the process.
Key to resolving this problem is the interpretation of the flow as a bistable
system with nonlinear propagation (advection) of turbulent fronts. These findings
bridge the gap between our understanding of the onset of turbulence and fully
turbulent flows.

Most stars become white dwarfs after they have exhausted their nuclear fuel (the 
Sun will be one such). Between one-quarter and one-half of white dwarfs have
elements heavier than helium in their atmospheres, even though these elements
ought to sink rapidly into the stellar interiors (unless they are occasionally
replenished). The abundance ratios of heavy elements in the atmospheres of white 
dwarfs are similar to the ratios in rocky bodies in the Solar System. This fact, 
together with the existence of warm, dusty debris disks surrounding about four
per cent of white dwarfs, suggests that rocky debris from the planetary systems
of white-dwarf progenitors occasionally pollutes the atmospheres of the stars.
The total accreted mass of this debris is sometimes comparable to the mass of
large asteroids in the Solar System. However, rocky, disintegrating bodies around
a white dwarf have not yet been observed. Here we report observations of a white 
dwarf--WD 1145+017--being transited by at least one, and probably several,
disintegrating planetesimals, with periods ranging from 4.5 hours to 4.9 hours.
The strongest transit signals occur every 4.5 hours and exhibit varying depths
(blocking up to 40 per cent of the star's brightness) and asymmetric profiles,
indicative of a small object with a cometary tail of dusty effluent material. The
star has a dusty debris disk, and the star's spectrum shows prominent lines from 
heavy elements such as magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron, and nickel. 
This system provides further evidence that the pollution of white dwarfs by heavy
elements might originate from disrupted rocky bodies such as asteroids and minor 
planets.

Tidal forces close to massive black holes can violently disrupt stars that make a
close approach. These extreme events are discovered via bright X-ray and
optical/ultraviolet flares in galactic centres. Prior studies based on modelling 
decaying flux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the
mass accretion rate. Here we report the detection of flows of hot, ionized gas in
high-resolution X-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event, ASASSN-14li in 
the galaxy PGC 043234. Variability within the absorption-dominated spectra
indicates that the gas is relatively close to the black hole. Narrow linewidths
indicate that the gas does not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low 
volume filling factor. Modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometres per
second are observed; these are below the escape speed from the radius set by
variability. The gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,
super-Eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament of
disrupted stellar gas near to the apocentre of an elliptical orbit. Flows of this
sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory and more recent numerical
simulations.

Which genetic alterations drive tumorigenesis and how they evolve over the course
of disease and therapy are central questions in cancer biology. Here we identify 
44 recurrently mutated genes and 11 recurrent somatic copy number variations
through whole-exome sequencing of 538 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and
matched germline DNA samples, 278 of which were collected in a prospective
clinical trial. These include previously unrecognized putative cancer drivers
(RPS15, IKZF3), and collectively identify RNA processing and export, MYC
activity, and MAPK signalling as central pathways involved in CLL. Clonality
analysis of this large data set further enabled reconstruction of temporal
relationships between driver events. Direct comparison between matched
pre-treatment and relapse samples from 59 patients demonstrated highly frequent
clonal evolution. Thus, large sequencing data sets of clinically informative
samples enable the discovery of novel genes associated with cancer, the network
of relationships between the driver events, and their impact on disease relapse
and clinical outcome.

Oncogenic activation of BRAF fuels cancer growth by constitutively promoting
RAS-independent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signalling.
Accordingly, RAF inhibitors have brought substantially improved personalized
treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, these targeted agents have also
revealed an unexpected consequence: stimulated growth of certain cancers.
Structurally diverse ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors can either inhibit or
paradoxically activate the MAPK pathway, depending whether activation is by BRAF 
mutation or by an upstream event, such as RAS mutation or receptor tyrosine
kinase activation. Here we have identified next-generation RAF inhibitors (dubbed
'paradox breakers') that suppress mutant BRAF cells without activating the MAPK
pathway in cells bearing upstream activation. In cells that express the same HRAS
mutation prevalent in squamous tumours from patients treated with RAF inhibitors,
the first-generation RAF inhibitor vemurafenib stimulated in vitro and in vivo
growth and induced expression of MAPK pathway response genes; by contrast the
paradox breakers PLX7904 and PLX8394 had no effect. Paradox breakers also
overcame several known mechanisms of resistance to first-generation RAF
inhibitors. Dissociating MAPK pathway inhibition from paradoxical activation
might yield both improved safety and more durable efficacy than first-generation 
RAF inhibitors, a concept currently undergoing human clinical evaluation with
PLX8394.

Sea-level rise can threaten the long-term sustainability of coastal communities
and valuable ecosystems such as coral reefs, salt marshes and mangroves. Mangrove
forests have the capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise and to avoid
inundation through vertical accretion of sediments, which allows them to maintain
wetland soil elevations suitable for plant growth. The Indo-Pacific region holds 
most of the world's mangrove forests, but sediment delivery in this region is
declining, owing to anthropogenic activities such as damming of rivers. This
decline is of particular concern because the Indo-Pacific region is expected to
have variable, but high, rates of future sea-level rise. Here we analyse recent
trends in mangrove surface elevation changes across the Indo-Pacific region using
data from a network of surface elevation table instruments. We find that sediment
availability can enable mangrove forests to maintain rates of soil-surface
elevation gain that match or exceed that of sea-level rise, but for 69 per cent
of our study sites the current rate of sea-level rise exceeded the soil surface
elevation gain. We also present a model based on our field data, which suggests
that mangrove forests at sites with low tidal range and low sediment supply could
be submerged as early as 2070.

It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate
extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide. Early results
suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities 
was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering 
more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities. However,
subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results. Here we use data from 46
experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether
biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We
show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of
climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged
events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity 
communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate
events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16-32 species was more
resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate
event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal
levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no
detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results
suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and
productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate
events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus
seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability, and restoration of biodiversity to
increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to
climate events.

response.

The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine 
(m(6)A), which has broad roles in RNA biology. In mammalian cells, the asymmetric
distribution of m(6)A along mRNAs results in relatively less methylation in the
5' untranslated region (5'UTR) compared to other regions. However, whether and
how 5'UTR methylation is regulated is poorly understood. Despite the crucial role
of the 5'UTR in translation initiation, very little is known about whether m(6)A 
modification influences mRNA translation. Here we show that in response to heat
shock stress, certain adenosines within the 5'UTR of newly transcribed mRNAs are 
preferentially methylated. We find that the dynamic 5'UTR methylation is a result
of stress-induced nuclear localization of YTHDF2, a well-characterized m(6)A
'reader'. Upon heat shock stress, the nuclear YTHDF2 preserves 5'UTR methylation 
of stress-induced transcripts by limiting the m(6)A 'eraser' FTO from
demethylation. Remarkably, the increased 5'UTR methylation in the form of m(6)A
promotes cap-independent translation initiation, providing a mechanism for
selective mRNA translation under heat shock stress. Using Hsp70 mRNA as an
example, we demonstrate that a single m(6)A modification site in the 5'UTR
enables translation initiation independent of the 5' end N(7)-methylguanosine
cap. The elucidation of the dynamic features of 5'UTR methylation and its
critical role in cap-independent translation not only expands the breadth of
physiological roles of m(6)A, but also uncovers a previously unappreciated
translational control mechanism in heat shock response.

Exciton-polaritons are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by strongly
interacting photons and excitons (electron-hole pairs) in semiconductor
microcavities. They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for
next-generation optoelectronic applications as well as for fundamental studies of
quantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly open 
(that is, non-Hermitian) quantum system, which requires constant pumping of
energy and continuously decays, releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the
exciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and
loss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far
been largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that
non-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral
degeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their
quantum transport, localization and dynamical properties. Using a spatially
structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton billiard--a
two-dimensional area enclosed by a curved potential barrier. Eigenmodes of this
billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies, known as
exceptional points. Such points can cause remarkable wave phenomena, such as
unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption and chiral modes. By
varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and anti-crossing of
energy levels and reveal the non-trivial topological modal structure exclusive to
non-Hermitian systems. We also observe mode switching and a topological Berry
phase for a parameter loop encircling the exceptional point. Our findings pave
the way to studies of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics of exciton-polaritons, which
may uncover novel operating principles for polariton-based devices.

Although reconstruction of the phylogeny of living birds has progressed
tremendously in the last decade, the evolutionary history of Neoaves--a clade
that encompasses nearly all living bird species--remains the greatest unresolved 
challenge in dinosaur systematics. Here we investigate avian phylogeny with an
unprecedented scale of data: >390,000 bases of genomic sequence data from each of
198 species of living birds, representing all major avian lineages, and two
crocodilian outgroups. Sequence data were collected using anchored hybrid
enrichment, yielding 259 nuclear loci with an average length of 1,523 bases for a
total data set of over 7.8 × 10(7) bases. Bayesian and maximum likelihood
analyses yielded highly supported and nearly identical phylogenetic trees for all
major avian lineages. Five major clades form successive sister groups to the rest
of Neoaves: (1) a clade including nightjars, other caprimulgiforms, swifts, and
hummingbirds; (2) a clade uniting cuckoos, bustards, and turacos with pigeons,
mesites, and sandgrouse; (3) cranes and their relatives; (4) a comprehensive
waterbird clade, including all diving, wading, and shorebirds; and (5) a
comprehensive landbird clade with the enigmatic hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) as 
the sister group to the rest. Neither of the two main, recently proposed Neoavian
clades--Columbea and Passerea--were supported as monophyletic. The results of our
divergence time analyses are congruent with the palaeontological record,
supporting a major radiation of crown birds in the wake of the
Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) mass extinction.

The human kidney contains up to 2 million epithelial nephrons responsible for
blood filtration. Regenerating the kidney requires the induction of the more than
20 distinct cell types required for excretion and the regulation of pH, and
electrolyte and fluid balance. We have previously described the simultaneous
induction of progenitors for both collecting duct and nephrons via the directed
differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells. Paradoxically, although both are
of intermediate mesoderm in origin, collecting duct and nephrons have distinct
temporospatial origins. Here we identify the developmental mechanism regulating
the preferential induction of collecting duct versus kidney mesenchyme
progenitors. Using this knowledge, we have generated kidney organoids that
contain nephrons associated with a collecting duct network surrounded by renal
interstitium and endothelial cells. Within these organoids, individual nephrons
segment into distal and proximal tubules, early loops of Henle, and glomeruli
containing podocytes elaborating foot processes and undergoing vascularization.
When transcription profiles of kidney organoids were compared to human fetal
tissues, they showed highest congruence with first trimester human kidney.
Furthermore, the proximal tubules endocytose dextran and differentially apoptose 
in response to cisplatin, a nephrotoxicant. Such kidney organoids represent
powerful models of the human organ for future applications, including
nephrotoxicity screening, disease modelling and as a source of cells for therapy.

Postnatal tissue quiescence is thought to be a default state in the absence of a 
proliferative stimulus such as injury. Although previous studies have
demonstrated that certain embryonic developmental programs are reactivated
aberrantly in adult organs to drive repair and regeneration, it is not well
understood how quiescence is maintained in organs such as the lung, which
displays a remarkably low level of cellular turnover. Here we demonstrate that
quiescence in the adult lung is an actively maintained state and is regulated by 
hedgehog signalling. Epithelial-specific deletion of sonic hedgehog (Shh) during 
postnatal homeostasis in the murine lung results in a proliferative expansion of 
the adjacent lung mesenchyme. Hedgehog signalling is initially downregulated
during the acute phase of epithelial injury as the mesenchyme proliferates in
response, but returns to baseline during injury resolution as quiescence is
restored. Activation of hedgehog during acute epithelial injury attenuates the
proliferative expansion of the lung mesenchyme, whereas inactivation of hedgehog 
signalling prevents the restoration of quiescence during injury resolution.
Finally, we show that hedgehog also regulates epithelial quiescence and
regeneration in response to injury via a mesenchymal feedback mechanism. These
results demonstrate that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions coordinated by
hedgehog actively maintain postnatal tissue homeostasis, and deregulation of
hedgehog during injury leads to aberrant repair and regeneration in the lung.

Photoreceptor proteins enable organisms to sense and respond to light. The newly 
discovered CarH-type photoreceptors use a vitamin B12 derivative,
adenosylcobalamin, as the light-sensing chromophore to mediate light-dependent
gene regulation. Here we present crystal structures of Thermus thermophilus CarH 
in all three relevant states: in the dark, both free and bound to operator DNA,
and after light exposure. These structures provide visualizations of how
adenosylcobalamin mediates CarH tetramer formation in the dark, how this tetramer
binds to the promoter -35 element to repress transcription, and how light
exposure leads to a large-scale conformational change that activates
transcription. In addition to the remarkable functional repurposing of
adenosylcobalamin from an enzyme cofactor to a light sensor, we find that nature 
also repurposed two independent protein modules in assembling CarH. These results
expand the biological role of vitamin B12 and provide fundamental insight into a 
new mode of light-dependent gene regulation.

Multicellular assemblages of microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature, and the
proximity afforded by aggregation is thought to permit intercellular metabolic
coupling that can accommodate otherwise unfavourable reactions. Consortia of
methane-oxidizing archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria are a well-known
environmental example of microbial co-aggregation; however, the coupling
mechanisms between these paired organisms is not well understood, despite the
attention given them because of the global significance of anaerobic methane
oxidation. Here we examined the influence of interspecies spatial positioning as 
it relates to biosynthetic activity within structurally diverse uncultured
methane-oxidizing consortia by measuring stable isotope incorporation for
individual archaeal and bacterial cells to constrain their potential metabolic
interactions. In contrast to conventional models of syntrophy based on the
passage of molecular intermediates, cellular activities were found to be
independent of both species intermixing and distance between syntrophic partners 
within consortia. A generalized model of electric conductivity between
co-associated archaea and bacteria best fit the empirical data. Combined with the
detection of large multi-haem cytochromes in the genomes of methanotrophic
archaea and the demonstration of redox-dependent staining of the matrix between
cells in consortia, these results provide evidence for syntrophic coupling
through direct electron transfer.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a frequent disease in which the genetic
alterations determining the clinicobiological behaviour are not fully understood.
Here we describe a comprehensive evaluation of the genomic landscape of 452 CLL
cases and 54 patients with monoclonal B-lymphocytosis, a precursor disorder. We
extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, 
ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding
regions, including the 3' region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events,
increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition,
mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression 
of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5. The accumulative number of
driver alterations (0 to ≥4) discriminated between patients with differences in
clinical behaviour. This study provides an integrated portrait of the CLL genomic
landscape, identifies new recurrent driver mutations of the disease, and suggests
clinical interventions that may improve the management of this neoplasia.

Execution of accurate eye movements depends critically on the cerebellum,
suggesting that the major output neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, may
predict motion of the eye. However, this encoding of action for rapid eye
movements (saccades) has remained unclear: Purkinje cells show little consistent 
modulation with respect to saccade amplitude or direction, and critically, their 
discharge lasts longer than the duration of a saccade. Here we analysed
Purkinje-cell discharge in the oculomotor vermis of behaving rhesus monkeys
(Macaca mulatta) and found neurons that increased or decreased their activity
during saccades. We estimated the combined effect of these two populations via
their projections to the caudal fastigial nucleus, and uncovered a simple-spike
population response that precisely predicted the real-time motion of the eye.
When we organized the Purkinje cells according to each cell's complex-spike
directional tuning, the simple-spike population response predicted both the
real-time speed and direction of saccade multiplicatively via a gain field. This 
suggests that the cerebellum predicts the real-time motion of the eye during
saccades via the combined inputs of Purkinje cells onto individual nucleus
neurons. A gain-field encoding of simple spikes emerges if the Purkinje cells
that project onto a nucleus neuron are not selected at random but share a common 
complex-spike property.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has improved the prospects for many individuals with
diseases affecting motor control, and recently it has shown promise for improving
cognitive function as well. Several studies in individuals with Alzheimer disease
and in amnesic rats have demonstrated that DBS targeted to the fimbria-fornix,
the region that appears to regulate hippocampal activity, can mitigate defects in
hippocampus-dependent memory. Despite these promising results, DBS has not been
tested for its ability to improve cognition in any childhood intellectual
disability disorder. Such disorders are a pressing concern: they affect as much
as 3% of the population and involve hundreds of different genes. We proposed that
stimulating the neural circuits that underlie learning and memory might provide a
more promising route to treating these otherwise intractable disorders than
seeking to adjust levels of one molecule at a time. We therefore studied the
effects of forniceal DBS in a well-characterized mouse model of Rett syndrome
(RTT), which is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females. Caused by 
mutations that impair the function of MeCP2 (ref. 6), RTT appears by the second
year of life in humans, causing profound impairment in cognitive, motor and
social skills, along with an array of neurological features. RTT mice, which
reproduce the broad phenotype of this disorder, also show clear deficits in
hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
Here we show that forniceal DBS in RTT mice rescues contextual fear memory as
well as spatial learning and memory. In parallel, forniceal DBS restores in vivo 
hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampal neurogenesis. These results
indicate that forniceal DBS might mitigate cognitive dysfunction in RTT.

Atmospheric warming is projected to increase global mean surface temperatures by 
0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial values by the end of this
century. If anthropogenic emissions continue unchecked, the warming increase may 
reach 8-10 degrees Celsius by 2300 (ref. 2). The contribution that large ice
sheets will make to sea-level rise under such warming scenarios is difficult to
quantify because the equilibrium-response timescale of ice sheets is longer than 
those of the atmosphere or ocean. Here we use a coupled ice-sheet/ice-shelf model
to show that if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above
present, collapse of the major Antarctic ice shelves triggers a centennial- to
millennial-scale response of the Antarctic ice sheet in which enhanced viscous
flow produces a long-term commitment (an unstoppable contribution) to sea-level
rise. Our simulations represent the response of the present-day Antarctic
ice-sheet system to the oceanic and climatic changes of four representative
concentration pathways (RCPs) from the Fifth Assessment Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We find that substantial Antarctic ice
loss can be prevented only by limiting greenhouse gas emissions to RCP 2.6
levels. Higher-emissions scenarios lead to ice loss from Antarctic that will
raise sea level by 0.6-3 metres by the year 2300. Our results imply that
greenhouse gas emissions in the next few decades will strongly influence the
long-term contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea level.

The double-gamma (γγ)-decay of a quantum system in an excited state is a
fundamental second-order process of quantum electrodynamics. In contrast to the
well-known single-gamma (γ)-decay, the γγ-decay is characterized by the
simultaneous emission of two γ quanta, each with a continuous energy spectrum. In
nuclear physics, this exotic decay mode has only been observed for transitions
between states with spin-parity quantum numbers J(π) = 0(+) (refs 1-3).
Single-gamma decays-the main experimental obstacle to observing the γγ-decay-are 
strictly forbidden for these 0(+) → 0(+) transitions. Here we report the
observation of the γγ-decay of an excited nuclear state (J(π) = 11/2(-)) that is 
directly competing with an allowed γ-decay (to ground state J(π) = 3/2(+)). The
branching ratio of the competitive γγ-decay of the 11/2(-) isomer of (137)Ba to
the ground state relative to its single γ-decay was determined to be (2.05 ±
0.37) × 10(-6). From the measured angular correlation and the shape of the energy
spectra of the individual γ-rays, the contributing combinations of
multipolarities of the γ radiation were determined. Transition matrix elements
calculated using the quasiparticle-phonon model reproduce our measurements well. 
The γγ-decay rate gives access to so far unexplored important nuclear structure
information, such as the generalized (off-diagonal) nuclear electric
polarizabilities and magnetic susceptibilities.

Sex differences in behaviour extend to cognitive-like processes such as learning,
but the underlying dimorphisms in neural circuit development and organization
that generate these behavioural differences are largely unknown. Here we define
at the single-cell level-from development, through neural circuit connectivity,
to function-the neural basis of a sex-specific learning in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that sexual conditioning, a form of associative
learning, requires a pair of male-specific interneurons whose progenitors are
fully differentiated glia. These neurons are generated during sexual maturation
and incorporated into pre-exisiting sex-shared circuits to couple chemotactic
responses to reproductive priorities. Our findings reveal a general role for glia
as neural progenitors across metazoan taxa and demonstrate that the addition of
sex-specific neuron types to brain circuits during sexual maturation is an
important mechanism for the generation of sexually dimorphic plasticity in
learning.

The Mesozoic era (252-66 million years ago), known as the domain of dinosaurs,
witnessed a remarkable ecomorphological diversity of early mammals. The key
mammalian characteristics originated during this period and were prerequisite for
their evolutionary success after extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million
years ago. Many ecomorphotypes familiar to modern mammal fauna evolved
independently early in mammalian evolutionary history. Here we report a
125-million-year-old eutriconodontan mammal from Spain with extraordinary
preservation of skin and pelage that extends the record of key mammalian
integumentary features into the Mesozoic era. The new mammalian specimen exhibits
such typical mammalian features as pelage, mane, pinna, and a variety of skin
structures: keratinous dermal scutes, protospines composed of hair-like tubules, 
and compound follicles with primary and secondary hairs. The skin structures of
this new Mesozoic mammal encompass the same combination of integumentary features
as those evolved independently in other crown Mammalia, with similarly broad
structural variations as in extant mammals. Soft tissues in the thorax and
abdomen (alveolar lungs and liver) suggest the presence of a muscular diaphragm. 
The eutriconodont has molariform tooth replacement, ossified Meckel's cartilage
of the middle ear, and specialized xenarthrous articulations of posterior dorsal 
vertebrae, convergent with extant xenarthran mammals, which strengthened the
vertebral column for locomotion.

Perhaps one of the greatest scientific challenges is to understand the human
brain. Here we review current methods in human neuroscience, highlighting the
ways that they have been used to study the neural bases of the human mind. We
begin with a consideration of different levels of description relevant to human
neuroscience, from molecules to large-scale networks, and then review the methods
that probe these levels and the ability of these methods to test hypotheses about
causal mechanisms. Functional MRI is considered in particular detail, as it has
been responsible for much of the recent growth of human neuroscience research. We
briefly review its inferential strengths and weaknesses and present examples of
new analytic approaches that allow inferences beyond simple localization of
psychological processes. Finally, we review the prospects for real-world
applications and new scientific challenges for human neuroscience.

An enhanced understanding of the molecular pathology of disease gained from
genomic studies is facilitating the development of treatments that target
discrete molecular subclasses of tumours. Considerable associated challenges
include how to advance and implement targeted drug-development strategies.
Precision medicine centres on delivering the most appropriate therapy to a
patient on the basis of clinical and molecular features of their disease. The
development of therapeutic agents that target molecular mechanisms is driving
innovation in clinical-trial strategies. Although progress has been made,
modifications to existing core paradigms in oncology drug development will be
required to realize fully the promise of precision medicine.

Recent clinical trials of gene therapy have shown remarkable therapeutic benefits
and an excellent safety record. They provide evidence for the long-sought promise
of gene therapy to deliver 'cures' for some otherwise terminal or severely
disabling conditions. Behind these advances lie improved vector designs that
enable the safe delivery of therapeutic genes to specific cells. Technologies for
editing genes and correcting inherited mutations, the engagement of stem cells to
regenerate tissues and the effective exploitation of powerful immune responses to
fight cancer are also contributing to the revitalization of gene therapy.

After decades of discovery, inherited variations have been identified in
approximately 20 genes that affect about 80 medications and are actionable in the
clinic. And some somatically acquired genetic variants direct the choice of
'targeted' anticancer drugs for individual patients. Current efforts that focus
on the processes required to appropriately act on pharmacogenomic variability in 
the clinic are moving away from discovery and towards implementation of an
evidenced-based strategy for improving the use of medications, thereby providing 
a cornerstone for precision medicine.

Precision medicine has the potential to profoundly improve the practice of
medicine. However, the advances required will take time to implement. Genetics is
already being used to direct clinical decision-making and its contribution is
likely to increase. To accelerate these advances, fundamental changes are needed 
in the infrastructure and mechanisms for data collection, storage and sharing.
This will create a continuously learning health-care system with seamless cycling
between clinical care and research. Patients must be educated about the benefits 
of sharing data. The building blocks for such a system are already forming and
they will accelerate the adoption of precision medicine.

A promising route to the synthesis of protein-mimetic materials that are capable 
of complex functions, such as molecular recognition and catalysis, is provided by
sequence-defined peptoid polymers--structural relatives of biologically occurring
polypeptides. Peptoids, which are relatively non-toxic and resistant to
degradation, can fold into defined structures through a combination of
sequence-dependent interactions. However, the range of possible structures that
are accessible to peptoids and other biological mimetics is unknown, and our
ability to design protein-like architectures from these polymer classes is
limited. Here we use molecular-dynamics simulations, together with scattering and
microscopy data, to determine the atomic-resolution structure of the recently
discovered peptoid nanosheet, an ordered supramolecular assembly that extends
macroscopically in only two dimensions. Our simulations show that nanosheets are 
structurally and dynamically heterogeneous, can be formed only from peptoids of
certain lengths, and are potentially porous to water and ions. Moreover, their
formation is enabled by the peptoids' adoption of a secondary structure that is
not seen in the natural world. This structure, a zigzag pattern that we call a
Σ('sigma')-strand, results from the ability of adjacent backbone monomers to
adopt opposed rotational states, thereby allowing the backbone to remain linear
and untwisted. Linear backbones tiled in a brick-like way form an extended
two-dimensional nanostructure, the Σ-sheet. The binary rotational-state motif of 
the Σ-strand is not seen in regular protein structures, which are usually built
from one type of rotational state. We also show that the concept of building
regular structures from multiple rotational states can be generalized beyond the 
peptoid nanosheet system.

Activation of oncogenes by mechanisms other than genetic aberrations such as
mutations, translocations, or amplifications is largely undefined. Here we report
a novel isoform of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) that is expressed in ∼11%
of melanomas and sporadically in other human cancer types, but not in normal
tissues. The novel ALK transcript initiates from a de novo alternative
transcription initiation (ATI) site in ALK intron 19, and was termed ALK(ATI). In
ALK(ATI)-expressing tumours, the ATI site is enriched for H3K4me3 and RNA
polymerase II, chromatin marks characteristic of active transcription initiation 
sites. ALK(ATI) is expressed from both ALK alleles, and no recurrent genetic
aberrations are found at the ALK locus, indicating that the transcriptional
activation is independent of genetic aberrations at the ALK locus. The ALK(ATI)
transcript encodes three proteins with molecular weights of 61.1, 60.8 and 58.7
kilodaltons, consisting primarily of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.
ALK(ATI) stimulates multiple oncogenic signalling pathways, drives
growth-factor-independent cell proliferation in vitro, and promotes tumorigenesis
in vivo in mouse models. ALK inhibitors can suppress the kinase activity of
ALK(ATI), suggesting that patients with ALK(ATI)-expressing tumours may benefit
from ALK inhibitors. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of oncogene
activation in cancer through de novo alternative transcription initiation.

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a distinct brain state characterized by
activated electroencephalogram and complete skeletal muscle paralysis, and is
associated with vivid dreams. Transection studies by Jouvet first demonstrated
that the brainstem is both necessary and sufficient for REM sleep generation, and
the neural circuits in the pons have since been studied extensively. The medulla 
also contains neurons that are active during REM sleep, but whether they play a
causal role in REM sleep generation remains unclear. Here we show that a
GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing) pathway originating from the ventral
medulla powerfully promotes REM sleep in mice. Optogenetic activation of ventral 
medulla GABAergic neurons rapidly and reliably initiated REM sleep episodes and
prolonged their durations, whereas inactivating these neurons had the opposite
effects. Optrode recordings from channelrhodopsin-2-tagged ventral medulla
GABAergic neurons showed that they were most active during REM sleep (REMmax),
and during wakefulness they were preferentially active during eating and
grooming. Furthermore, dual retrograde tracing showed that the rostral
projections to the pons and midbrain and caudal projections to the spinal cord
originate from separate ventral medulla neuron populations. Activating the
rostral GABAergic projections was sufficient for both the induction and
maintenance of REM sleep, which are probably mediated in part by inhibition of
REM-suppressing GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey. These
results identify a key component of the pontomedullary network controlling REM
sleep. The capability to induce REM sleep on command may offer a powerful tool
for investigating its functions.

Quantum computation requires qubits that can be coupled in a scalable manner,
together with universal and high-fidelity one- and two-qubit logic gates. Many
physical realizations of qubits exist, including single photons, trapped ions,
superconducting circuits, single defects or atoms in diamond and silicon, and
semiconductor quantum dots, with single-qubit fidelities that exceed the
stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Despite this,
high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid state that can be manufactured using
standard lithographic techniques have so far been limited to superconducting
qubits, owing to the difficulties of coupling qubits and dephasing in
semiconductor systems. Here we present a two-qubit logic gate, which uses single 
spins in isotopically enriched silicon and is realized by performing single- and 
two-qubit operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as
envisaged in the Loss-DiVincenzo proposal. We realize CNOT gates via
controlled-phase operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct
gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a
switchable exchange interaction that is used in the two-qubit controlled-phase
gate. By independently reading out both qubits, we measure clear anticorrelations
in the two-spin probabilities of the CNOT gate.

Enhancing repair of myelin is an important but still elusive therapeutic goal in 
many neurological disorders. In multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory demyelinating
disease, endogenous remyelination does occur but is frequently insufficient to
restore function. Both parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and
endogenous adult neural stem cells resident within the subventricular zone are
known sources of remyelinating cells. Here we characterize the contribution to
remyelination of a subset of adult neural stem cells, identified by their
expression of Gli1, a transcriptional effector of the sonic hedgehog pathway. We 
show that these cells are recruited from the subventricular zone to populate
demyelinated lesions in the forebrain but never enter healthy, white matter
tracts. Unexpectedly, recruitment of this pool of neural stem cells, and their
differentiation into oligodendrocytes, is significantly enhanced by genetic or
pharmacological inhibition of Gli1. Importantly, complete inhibition of canonical
hedgehog signalling was ineffective, indicating that the role of Gli1 both in
augmenting hedgehog signalling and in retarding myelination is specialized.
Indeed, inhibition of Gli1 improves the functional outcome in a
relapsing/remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and is
neuroprotective. Thus, endogenous neural stem cells can be mobilized for the
repair of demyelinated lesions by inhibiting Gli1, identifying a new therapeutic 
avenue for the treatment of demyelinating disorders.

The altered activity of the fructose transporter GLUT5, an isoform of the
facilitated-diffusion glucose transporter family, has been linked to disorders
such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLUT5 is also overexpressed in certain
tumour cells, and inhibitors are potential drugs for these conditions. Here we
describe the crystal structures of GLUT5 from Rattus norvegicus and Bos taurus in
open outward- and open inward-facing conformations, respectively. GLUT5 has a
major facilitator superfamily fold like other homologous monosaccharide
transporters. On the basis of a comparison of the inward-facing structures of
GLUT5 and human GLUT1, a ubiquitous glucose transporter, we show that a single
point mutation is enough to switch the substrate-binding preference of GLUT5 from
fructose to glucose. A comparison of the substrate-free structures of GLUT5 with 
occluded substrate-bound structures of Escherichia coli XylE suggests that, in
addition to global rocker-switch-like re-orientation of the bundles, local
asymmetric rearrangements of carboxy-terminal transmembrane bundle helices TM7
and TM10 underlie a 'gated-pore' transport mechanism in such monosaccharide
transporters.

The factors shaping cometary nuclei are still largely unknown, but could be the
result of concurrent effects of evolutionary and primordial processes. The
peculiar bilobed shape of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko may be the result of
the fusion of two objects that were once separate or the result of a localized
excavation by outgassing at the interface between the two lobes. Here we report
that the comet's major lobe is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of strata, up
to 650 metres thick, which are independent of an analogous stratified envelope on
the minor lobe. Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are closer 
to perpendicular to the strata than those calculated for the entire nucleus and
adjacent to the neck separating the two lobes. Therefore comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with
'onion-like' stratification, which formed before they merged. We conclude that
gentle, low-velocity collisions occurred between two fully formed kilometre-sized
cometesimals in the early stages of the Solar System. The notable structural
similarities between the two lobes of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko indicate
that the early-forming cometesimals experienced similar primordial stratified
accretion, even though they formed independently.

Humans prefer relatively equal distributions of resources, yet societies have
varying degrees of economic inequality. To investigate some of the possible
determinants and consequences of inequality, here we perform experiments
involving a networked public goods game in which subjects interact and gain or
lose wealth. Subjects (n = 1,462) were randomly assigned to have higher or lower 
initial endowments, and were embedded within social networks with three levels of
economic inequality (Gini coefficient = 0.0, 0.2, and 0.4). In addition, we
manipulated the visibility of the wealth of network neighbours. We show that
wealth visibility facilitates the downstream consequences of initial
inequality-in initially more unequal situations, wealth visibility leads to
greater inequality than when wealth is invisible. This result reflects a
heterogeneous response to visibility in richer versus poorer subjects. We also
find that making wealth visible has adverse welfare consequences, yielding lower 
levels of overall cooperation, inter-connectedness, and wealth. High initial
levels of economic inequality alone, however, have relatively few deleterious
welfare effects.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques,
which are predominantly composed of amyloid-β peptide. Two principal
physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-β generation from its
precursor, β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manner. Although
APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem 
to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo. Here we describe a
new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments
capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify
higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-η, in 
addition to the long-known CTF-α and CTF-β fragments generated by the α- and
β-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (β-site
APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-η generation is mediated in part by
membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as
η-secretase activity. η-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids
504-505 of APP695, releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this
ectodomain, CTF-η is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and
short Aη peptides (termed Aη-α and Aη-β). CTFs produced by η-secretase are
enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains.
Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust
accumulation of CTF-η and Aη-α. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor,
hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or
synthetic Aη-α was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation 
was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed
that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by Aη-α. These findings not
only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may
also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies
targeting APP processing.

The major facilitator superfamily glucose transporters, exemplified by human
GLUT1-4, have been central to the study of solute transport. Using lipidic cubic 
phase crystallization and microfocus X-ray diffraction, we determined the
structure of human GLUT3 in complex with D-glucose at 1.5 Å resolution in an
outward-occluded conformation. The high-resolution structure allows
discrimination of both α- and β-anomers of D-glucose. Two additional structures
of GLUT3 bound to the exofacial inhibitor maltose were obtained at 2.6 Å in the
outward-open and 2.4 Å in the outward-occluded states. In all three structures,
the ligands are predominantly coordinated by polar residues from the carboxy
terminal domain. Conformational transition from outward-open to outward-occluded 
entails a prominent local rearrangement of the extracellular part of
transmembrane segment TM7. Comparison of the outward-facing GLUT3 structures with
the inward-open GLUT1 provides insights into the alternating access cycle for
GLUTs, whereby the C-terminal domain provides the primary substrate-binding site 
and the amino-terminal domain undergoes rigid-body rotation with respect to the
C-terminal domain. Our studies provide an important framework for the mechanistic
and kinetic understanding of GLUTs and shed light on structure-guided ligand
design.

The Earth's inner core grows by the freezing of liquid iron at its surface. The
point in history at which this process initiated marks a step-change in the
thermal evolution of the planet. Recent computational and experimental studies
have presented radically differing estimates of the thermal conductivity of the
Earth's core, resulting in estimates of the timing of inner-core nucleation
ranging from less than half a billion to nearly two billion years ago. Recent
inner-core nucleation (high thermal conductivity) requires high outer-core
temperatures in the early Earth that complicate models of thermal evolution. The 
nucleation of the core leads to a different convective regime and potentially
different magnetic field structures that produce an observable signal in the
palaeomagnetic record and allow the date of inner-core nucleation to be estimated
directly. Previous studies searching for this signature have been hampered by the
paucity of palaeomagnetic intensity measurements, by the lack of an effective
means of assessing their reliability, and by shorter-timescale geomagnetic
variations. Here we examine results from an expanded Precambrian database of
palaeomagnetic intensity measurements selected using a new set of reliability
criteria. Our analysis provides intensity-based support for the dominant
dipolarity of the time-averaged Precambrian field, a crucial requirement for
palaeomagnetic reconstructions of continents. We also present firm evidence for
the existence of very long-term variations in geomagnetic strength. The most
prominent and robust transition in the record is an increase in both average
field strength and variability that is observed to occur between a billion and
1.5 billion years ago. This observation is most readily explained by the
nucleation of the inner core occurring during this interval; the timing would
tend to favour a modest value of core thermal conductivity and supports a simple 
thermal evolution model for the Earth.

Quantum critical systems derive their finite-temperature properties from the
influence of a zero-temperature quantum phase transition. The paradigm is
essential for understanding unconventional high-Tc superconductors and the
non-Fermi liquid properties of heavy fermion compounds. However, the microscopic 
origins of quantum phase transitions in complex materials are often debated. Here
we demonstrate experimentally, with support from numerical renormalization group 
calculations, a universal crossover from quantum critical non-Fermi liquid
behaviour to distinct Fermi liquid ground states in a highly controllable quantum
dot device. Our device realizes the non-Fermi liquid two-channel Kondo state,
based on a spin-1/2 impurity exchange-coupled equally to two independent
electronic reservoirs. On detuning the exchange couplings we observe the Fermi
liquid scale T*, at energies below which the spin is screened conventionally by
the more strongly coupled channel. We extract a quadratic dependence of T* on
gate voltage close to criticality, and validate an asymptotically exact
description of the universal crossover between strongly correlated non-Fermi
liquid and Fermi liquid states.

Many-body correlations and macroscopic quantum behaviours are fascinating
condensed matter problems. A powerful test-bed for the many-body concepts and
methods is the Kondo effect, which entails the coupling of a quantum impurity to 
a continuum of states. It is central in highly correlated systems and can be
explored with tunable nanostructures. Although Kondo physics is usually
associated with the hybridization of itinerant electrons with microscopic
magnetic moments, theory predicts that it can arise whenever degenerate quantum
states are coupled to a continuum. Here we demonstrate the previously elusive
'charge' Kondo effect in a hybrid metal-semiconductor implementation of a
single-electron transistor, with a quantum pseudospin of 1/2 constituted by two
degenerate macroscopic charge states of a metallic island. In contrast to other
Kondo nanostructures, each conduction channel connecting the island to an
electrode constitutes a distinct and fully tunable Kondo channel, thereby
providing unprecedented access to the two-channel Kondo effect and a clear path
to multi-channel Kondo physics. Using a weakly coupled probe, we find the
renormalization flow, as temperature is reduced, of two Kondo channels competing 
to screen the charge pseudospin. This provides a direct view of how the predicted
quantum phase transition develops across the symmetric quantum critical point.
Detuning the pseudospin away from degeneracy, we demonstrate, on a fully
characterized device, quantitative agreement with the predictions for the
finite-temperature crossover from quantum criticality.

In the 1980s, excess infrared emission was discovered around main-sequence stars;
subsequent direct-imaging observations revealed orbiting disks of cold dust to be
the source. These 'debris disks' were thought to be by-products of planet
formation because they often exhibited morphological and brightness asymmetries
that may result from gravitational perturbation by planets. This was proved to be
true for the β Pictoris system, in which the known planet generates an observable
warp in the disk. The nearby, young, unusually active late-type star AU
Microscopii hosts a well-studied edge-on debris disk; earlier observations in the
visible and near-infrared found asymmetric localized structures in the form of
intensity variations along the midplane of the disk beyond a distance of 20
astronomical units. Here we report high-contrast imaging that reveals a series of
five large-scale features in the southeast side of the disk, at projected
separations of 10-60 astronomical units, persisting over intervals of 1-4 years. 
All these features appear to move away from the star at projected speeds of 4-10 
kilometres per second, suggesting highly eccentric or unbound trajectories if
they are associated with physical entities. The origin, localization, morphology 
and rapid evolution of these features are difficult to reconcile with current
theories.

The high prevalence of sickle haemoglobin in Africa shows that malaria has been a
major force for human evolutionary selection, but surprisingly few other
polymorphisms have been proven to confer resistance to malaria in large
epidemiological studies. To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre
genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum
infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data
in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus 
close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for
erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that
provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence
interval = 0.60-0.76, P value = 9.5 × 10(-11)) and is linked to polymorphisms
that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, 
on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees. Taken together 
with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O, these
data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or
close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell
membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has
maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights
into the host-parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome 
of malaria infection.

Super-enhancers (SEs), which are composed of large clusters of enhancers densely 
loaded with the Mediator complex, transcription factors and chromatin regulators,
drive high expression of genes implicated in cell identity and disease, such as
lineage-controlling transcription factors and oncogenes. BRD4 and CDK7 are
positive regulators of SE-mediated transcription. By contrast, negative
regulators of SE-associated genes have not been well described. Here we show that
the Mediator-associated kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and CDK19
restrain increased activation of key SE-associated genes in acute myeloid
leukaemia (AML) cells. We report that the natural product cortistatin A (CA)
selectively inhibits Mediator kinases, has anti-leukaemic activity in vitro and
in vivo, and disproportionately induces upregulation of SE-associated genes in
CA-sensitive AML cell lines but not in CA-insensitive cell lines. In AML cells,
CA upregulated SE-associated genes with tumour suppressor and lineage-controlling
functions, including the transcription factors CEBPA, IRF8, IRF1 and ETV6 (refs
6-8). The BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 downregulated these SE-associated genes, yet
also has anti-leukaemic activity. Individually increasing or decreasing the
expression of these transcription factors suppressed AML cell growth, providing
evidence that leukaemia cells are sensitive to the dosage of SE-associated genes.
Our results demonstrate that Mediator kinases can negatively regulate
SE-associated gene expression in specific cell types, and can be
pharmacologically targeted as a therapeutic approach to AML.

HIV-1 Nef, a protein important for the development of AIDS, has
well-characterized effects on host membrane trafficking and receptor
downregulation. By an unidentified mechanism, Nef increases the intrinsic
infectivity of HIV-1 virions in a host-cell-dependent manner. Here we identify
the host transmembrane protein SERINC5, and to a lesser extent SERINC3, as a
potent inhibitor of HIV-1 particle infectivity that is counteracted by Nef.
SERINC5 localizes to the plasma membrane, where it is efficiently incorporated
into budding HIV-1 virions and impairs subsequent virion penetration of
susceptible target cells. Nef redirects SERINC5 to a Rab7-positive endosomal
compartment and thereby excludes it from HIV-1 particles. The ability to
counteract SERINC5 was conserved in Nef encoded by diverse primate
immunodeficiency viruses, as well as in the structurally unrelated glycosylated
Gag from murine leukaemia virus. These examples of functional conservation and
convergent evolution emphasize the fundamental importance of SERINC5 as a potent 
anti-retroviral factor.

HIV-1 Nef and the unrelated mouse leukaemia virus glycosylated Gag (glycoGag)
strongly enhance the infectivity of HIV-1 virions produced in certain cell types 
in a clathrin-dependent manner. Here we show that Nef and glycoGag prevent the
incorporation of the multipass transmembrane proteins serine incorporator 3
(SERINC3) and SERINC5 into HIV-1 virions to an extent that correlates with
infectivity enhancement. Silencing of both SERINC3 and SERINC5 precisely
phenocopied the effects of Nef and glycoGag on HIV-1 infectivity. The infectivity
of nef-deficient virions increased more than 100-fold when produced in
double-knockout human CD4(+) T cells that lack both SERINC3 and SERINC5, and
re-expression experiments confirmed that the absence of SERINC3 and SERINC5
accounted for the infectivity enhancement. Furthermore, SERINC3 and SERINC5
together restricted HIV-1 replication, and this restriction was evaded by Nef.
SERINC3 and SERINC5 are highly expressed in primary human HIV-1 target cells, and
inhibiting their downregulation by Nef is a potential strategy to combat
HIV/AIDS.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million
patients diagnosed annually. In late-stage colorectal cancer, the most commonly
used targeted therapies are the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, 
which prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Recent studies 
have identified alterations in KRAS and other genes as likely mechanisms of
primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these
efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be
present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of
sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in 
colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform
complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour
grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were
KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody
blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked 
therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified
genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as
potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in 
the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to
EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase
receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity 
to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome
in tumour graft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable
genes. These analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluating response to
targeted therapies in human cancer, highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to
anti-EGFR therapies, and delineate new avenues for intervention in managing
colorectal cancer.

Although all sensory circuits ascend to higher brain areas where stimuli are
represented in sparse, stimulus-specific activity patterns, relatively little is 
known about sensory coding on the descending side of neural circuits, as a
network converges. In insects, mushroom bodies have been an important model
system for studying sparse coding in the olfactory system, where this format is
important for accurate memory formation. In Drosophila, it has recently been
shown that the 2,000 Kenyon cells of the mushroom body converge onto a population
of only 34 mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), which fall into 21 anatomically 
distinct cell types. Here we provide the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive
view of olfactory representations at the fourth layer of the circuit, where we
find a clear transition in the principles of sensory coding. We show that MBON
tuning curves are highly correlated with one another. This is in sharp contrast
to the process of progressive decorrelation of tuning in the earlier layers of
the circuit. Instead, at the population level, odour representations are
reformatted so that positive and negative correlations arise between
representations of different odours. At the single-cell level, we show that
uniquely identifiable MBONs display profoundly different tuning across different 
animals, but that tuning of the same neuron across the two hemispheres of an
individual fly was nearly identical. Thus, individualized coordination of tuning 
arises at this level of the olfactory circuit. Furthermore, we find that this
individualization is an active process that requires a learning-related gene,
rutabaga. Ultimately, neural circuits have to flexibly map highly
stimulus-specific information in sparse layers onto a limited number of different
motor outputs. The reformatting of sensory representations we observe here may
mark the beginning of this sensory-motor transition in the olfactory system.

Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels of the Cys-loop receptor family are essential
mediators of fast neurotransmission throughout the nervous system and are
implicated in many neurological disorders. Available X-ray structures of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors provide tremendous insights into
the binding of agonists, the subsequent opening of the ion channel, and the
mechanism of channel activation. Yet the mechanism of inactivation by antagonists
remains unknown. Here we present a 3.0 Å X-ray structure of the human glycine
receptor-α3 homopentamer in complex with a high affinity, high-specificity
antagonist, strychnine. Our structure allows us to explore in detail the
molecular recognition of antagonists. Comparisons with previous structures reveal
a mechanism for antagonist-induced inactivation of Cys-loop receptors, involving 
an expansion of the orthosteric binding site in the extracellular domain that is 
coupled to closure of the ion pore in the transmembrane domain.

Carbohydrates are ubiquitous biological polymers that are important in a broad
range of biological processes. However, owing to their branched structures and
the presence of stereogenic centres at each glycosidic linkage between monomers, 
carbohydrates are harder to characterize than are peptides and oligonucleotides. 
Methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to
characterize glycosidic linkages, but this technique requires milligram amounts
of material and cannot detect small amounts of coexisting isomers. Mass
spectrometry, on the other hand, can provide information on carbohydrate
composition and connectivity for even small amounts of sample, but it cannot be
used to distinguish between stereoisomers. Here, we demonstrate that ion
mobility-mass spectrometry--a method that separates molecules according to their 
mass, charge, size, and shape--can unambiguously identify carbohydrate
linkage-isomers and stereoisomers. We analysed six synthetic carbohydrate isomers
that differ in composition, connectivity, or configuration. Our data show that
coexisting carbohydrate isomers can be identified, and relative concentrations of
the minor isomer as low as 0.1 per cent can be detected. In addition, the
analysis is rapid, and requires no derivatization and only small amounts of
sample. These results indicate that ion mobility-mass spectrometry is an
effective tool for the analysis of complex carbohydrates. This method could have 
an impact on the field of carbohydrate synthesis similar to that of the advent of
high-performance liquid chromatography on the field of peptide assembly in the
late 1970s.

The Trivers-Willard theory proposes that the sex ratio of offspring should vary
with maternal condition when it has sex-specific influences on offspring fitness.
In particular, mothers in good condition in polygynous and dimorphic species are 
predicted to produce an excess of sons, whereas mothers in poor condition should 
do the opposite. Despite the elegance of the theory, support for it has been
limited. Here we extend and generalize the Trivers-Willard theory to explain the 
disparity between predictions and observations of offspring sex ratio. In
polygynous species, males typically have higher mortality rates, different
age-specific reproductive schedules and more risk-prone life history tactics than
females; however, these differences are not currently incorporated into the
Trivers-Willard theory. Using two-sex models parameterized with data from
free-living mammal populations with contrasting levels of sex differences in
demography, we demonstrate how sex differences in life history traits over the
entire lifespan can lead to a wide range of sex allocation tactics, and show that
correlations between maternal condition and offspring sex ratio alone are
insufficient to conclude that mothers adaptively adjust offspring sex ratio.

Dilution of the cell cycle inhibitor Whi5 controls budding-yeast cell size.

Cell size fundamentally affects all biosynthetic processes by determining the
scale of organelles and influencing surface transport. Although extensive studies
have identified many mutations affecting cell size, the molecular mechanisms
underlying size control have remained elusive. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, size control occurs in G1 phase before Start, the point of
irreversible commitment to cell division. It was previously thought that activity
of the G1 cyclin Cln3 increased with cell size to trigger Start by initiating the
inhibition of the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 (refs 6-8). Here we show that
although Cln3 concentration does modulate the rate at which cells pass Start, its
synthesis increases in proportion to cell size so that its total concentration is
nearly constant during pre-Start G1. Rather than increasing Cln3 activity, we
identify decreasing Whi5 activity--due to the dilution of Whi5 by cell growth--as
a molecular mechanism through which cell size controls proliferation. Whi5 is
synthesized in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a largely size-independent
manner. This results in smaller daughter cells being born with higher Whi5
concentrations that extend their pre-Start G1 phase. Thus, at its most
fundamental level, size control in budding yeast results from the differential
scaling of Cln3 and Whi5 synthesis rates with cell size. More generally, our work
shows that differential size-dependency of protein synthesis can provide an
elegant mechanism to coordinate cellular functions with growth.

Since the year 2000, a concerted campaign against malaria has led to
unprecedented levels of intervention coverage across sub-Saharan Africa.
Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control
planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied
epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence
of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current
disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with
detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate
trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease
control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in
endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40% between
2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542-753 credible 
interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most
widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68% of cases
averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have 
substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing 
access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of
insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control
strategies.

The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (GlyR) mediates inhibitory synaptic
transmission in the spinal cord and brainstem and is linked to neurological
disorders, including autism and hyperekplexia. Understanding of molecular
mechanisms and pharmacology of glycine receptors has been hindered by a lack of
high-resolution structures. Here we report electron cryo-microscopy structures of
the zebrafish α1 GlyR with strychnine, glycine, or glycine and ivermectin
(glycine/ivermectin). Strychnine arrests the receptor in an antagonist-bound
closed ion channel state, glycine stabilizes the receptor in an agonist-bound
open channel state, and the glycine/ivermectin complex adopts a potentially
desensitized or partially open state. Relative to the glycine-bound state,
strychnine expands the agonist-binding pocket via outward movement of the C loop,
promotes rearrangement of the extracellular and transmembrane domain 'wrist'
interface, and leads to rotation of the transmembrane domain towards the pore
axis, occluding the ion conduction pathway. These structures illuminate the GlyR 
mechanism and define a rubric to interpret structures of Cys-loop receptors.

Glacial erosion is fundamental to our understanding of the role of Cenozoic-era
climate change in the development of topography worldwide, yet the factors that
control the rate of erosion by ice remain poorly understood. In many tectonically
active mountain ranges, glaciers have been inferred to be highly erosive, and
conditions of glaciation are used to explain both the marked relief typical of
alpine settings and the limit on mountain heights above the snowline, that is,
the glacial buzzsaw. In other high-latitude regions, glacial erosion is presumed 
to be minimal, where a mantle of cold ice effectively protects landscapes from
erosion. Glacial erosion rates are expected to increase with decreasing latitude,
owing to the climatic control on basal temperature and the production of
meltwater, which promotes glacial sliding, erosion and sediment transfer. This
relationship between climate, glacier dynamics and erosion rate is the focus of
recent numerical modelling, yet it is qualitative and lacks an empirical
database. Here we present a comprehensive data set that permits explicit
examination of the factors controlling glacier erosion across climatic regimes.
We report contemporary ice fluxes, sliding speeds and erosion rates inferred from
sediment yields from 15 outlet glaciers spanning 19 degrees of latitude from
Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula. Although this broad region has a relatively
uniform tectonic and geologic history, the thermal regimes of its glaciers range 
from temperate to polar. We find that basin-averaged erosion rates vary by three 
orders of magnitude over this latitudinal transect. Our findings imply that
climate and the glacier thermal regime control erosion rates more than do extent 
of ice cover, ice flux or sliding speeds.

The fast growth of information technology has been sustained by continuous
scaling down of the silicon-based metal-oxide field-effect transistor. However,
such technology faces two major challenges to further scaling. First, the device 
electrostatics (the ability of the transistor's gate electrode to control its
channel potential) are degraded when the channel length is decreased, using
conventional bulk materials such as silicon as the channel. Recently,
two-dimensional semiconducting materials have emerged as promising candidates to 
replace silicon, as they can maintain excellent device electrostatics even at
much reduced channel lengths. The second, more severe, challenge is that the
supply voltage can no longer be scaled down by the same factor as the transistor 
dimensions because of the fundamental thermionic limitation of the steepness of
turn-on characteristics, or subthreshold swing. To enable scaling to continue
without a power penalty, a different transistor mechanism is required to obtain
subthermionic subthreshold swing, such as band-to-band tunnelling. Here we
demonstrate band-to-band tunnel field-effect transistors (tunnel-FETs), based on 
a two-dimensional semiconductor, that exhibit steep turn-on; subthreshold swing
is a minimum of 3.9 millivolts per decade and an average of 31.1 millivolts per
decade for four decades of drain current at room temperature. By using highly
doped germanium as the source and atomically thin molybdenum disulfide as the
channel, a vertical heterostructure is built with excellent electrostatics, a
strain-free heterointerface, a low tunnelling barrier, and a large tunnelling
area. Our atomically thin and layered semiconducting-channel tunnel-FET
(ATLAS-TFET) is the only planar architecture tunnel-FET to achieve subthermionic 
subthreshold swing over four decades of drain current, as recommended in ref. 17,
and is also the only tunnel-FET (in any architecture) to achieve this at a low
power-supply voltage of 0.1 volts. Our device is at present the thinnest-channel 
subthermionic transistor, and has the potential to open up new avenues for
ultra-dense and low-power integrated circuits, as well as for ultra-sensitive
biosensors and gas sensors.

Structural variants are implicated in numerous diseases and make up the majority 
of varying nucleotides among human genomes. Here we describe an integrated set of
eight structural variant classes comprising both balanced and unbalanced
variants, which we constructed using short-read DNA sequencing data and
statistically phased onto haplotype blocks in 26 human populations. Analysing
this set, we identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting
population stratification and describe naturally occurring homozygous gene
knockouts that suggest the dispensability of a variety of human genes. We
demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by
genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression
quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of
structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject
to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with
multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events. 
Our catalogue will enhance future studies into structural variant demography,
functional impact and disease association.

The 1000 Genomes Project set out to provide a comprehensive description of common
human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of
individuals from multiple populations. Here we report completion of the project, 
having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a
combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and
dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic
variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000
structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource
includes >99% of SNP variants with a frequency of >1% for a variety of
ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global
sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.

CRISPR-Cas immunity in prokaryotes.

York, New York 10065, USA.

Prokaryotic organisms are threatened by a large array of viruses and have
developed numerous defence strategies. Among these, only clustered, regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems provide adaptive
immunity against foreign elements. Upon viral injection, a small sequence of the 
viral genome, known as a spacer, is integrated into the CRISPR locus to immunize 
the host cell. Spacers are transcribed into small RNA guides that direct the
cleavage of the viral DNA by Cas nucleases. Immunization through spacer
acquisition enables a unique form of evolution whereby a population not only
rapidly acquires resistance to its predators but also passes this resistance
mechanism vertically to its progeny.

Nitrogenases are the enzymes by which certain microorganisms convert atmospheric 
dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia, thereby providing essential nitrogen atoms for higher
organisms. The most common nitrogenases reduce atmospheric N2 at the FeMo
cofactor, a sulfur-rich iron-molybdenum cluster (FeMoco). The central iron sites 
that are coordinated to sulfur and carbon atoms in FeMoco have been proposed to
be the substrate binding sites, on the basis of kinetic and spectroscopic
studies. In the resting state, the central iron sites each have bonds to three
sulfur atoms and one carbon atom. Addition of electrons to the resting state
causes the FeMoco to react with N2, but the geometry and bonding environment of
N2-bound species remain unknown. Here we describe a synthetic complex with a
sulfur-rich coordination sphere that, upon reduction, breaks an Fe-S bond and
binds N2. The product is the first synthetic Fe-N2 complex in which iron has
bonds to sulfur and carbon atoms, providing a model for N2 coordination in the
FeMoco. Our results demonstrate that breaking an Fe-S bond is a chemically
reasonable route to N2 binding in the FeMoco, and show structural and
spectroscopic details for weakened N2 on a sulfur-rich iron site.

New genomic and fossil data illuminate the origin of enamel.

Enamel, the hardest vertebrate tissue, covers the teeth of almost all
sarcopterygians (lobe-finned bony fishes and tetrapods) as well as the scales and
dermal bones of many fossil lobe-fins. Enamel deposition requires an organic
matrix containing the unique enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) amelogenin (AMEL),
enamelin (ENAM) and ameloblastin (AMBN). Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes)
lack both enamel and EMP genes. Many fossil and a few living non-teleost
actinopterygians (ray-finned bony fishes) such as the gar, Lepisosteus, have
scales and dermal bones covered with a proposed enamel homologue called ganoine. 
However, no gene or transcript data for EMPs have been described from
actinopterygians. Here we show that Psarolepis romeri, a bony fish from the the
Early Devonian period, combines enamel-covered dermal odontodes on scales and
skull bones with teeth of naked dentine, and that Lepisosteus oculatus (the
spotted gar) has enam and ambn genes that are expressed in the skin, probably
associated with ganoine formation. The genetic evidence strengthens the
hypothesis that ganoine is homologous with enamel. The fossil evidence, further
supported by the Silurian bony fish Andreolepis, which has enamel-covered scales 
but teeth and odontodes on its dermal bones made of naked dentine, indicates that
this tissue originated on the dermal skeleton, probably on the scales. It
subsequently underwent heterotopic expansion across two highly conserved
patterning boundaries (scales/head-shoulder and dermal/oral) within the odontode 
skeleton.

Despite major advances in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of
cancer, metastasis remains the cause of >90% of cancer-related mortality.
Understanding metastasis initiation and progression is critical to developing new
therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent metastatic disease. Prevailing
theories hypothesize that metastases are seeded by rare tumour cells with unique 
properties, which may function like stem cells in their ability to initiate and
propagate metastatic tumours. However, the identity of metastasis-initiating
cells in human breast cancer remains elusive, and whether metastases are
hierarchically organized is unknown. Here we show at the single-cell level that
early stage metastatic cells possess a distinct stem-like gene expression
signature. To identify and isolate metastatic cells from patient-derived
xenograft models of human breast cancer, we developed a highly sensitive
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based assay, which allowed us to
enumerate metastatic cells in mouse peripheral tissues. We compared gene
signatures in metastatic cells from tissues with low versus high metastatic
burden. Metastatic cells from low-burden tissues were distinct owing to their
increased expression of stem cell, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
pro-survival, and dormancy-associated genes. By contrast, metastatic cells from
high-burden tissues were similar to primary tumour cells, which were more
heterogeneous and expressed higher levels of luminal differentiation genes.
Transplantation of stem-like metastatic cells from low-burden tissues showed that
they have considerable tumour-initiating capacity, and can differentiate to
produce luminal-like cancer cells. Progression to high metastatic burden was
associated with increased proliferation and MYC expression, which could be
attenuated by treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. These
findings support a hierarchical model for metastasis, in which metastases are
initiated by stem-like cells that proliferate and differentiate to produce
advanced metastatic disease.

Nuclear pore complexes are fundamental components of all eukaryotic cells that
mediate nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Determining their 110-megadalton structure
imposes a formidable challenge and requires in situ structural biology
approaches. Of approximately 30 nucleoporins (Nups), 15 are structured and form
the Y and inner-ring complexes. These two major scaffolding modules assemble in
multiple copies into an eight-fold rotationally symmetric structure that fuses
the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form a central channel of ~60 nm in
diameter. The scaffold is decorated with transport-channel Nups that often
contain phenylalanine-repeat sequences and mediate the interaction with cargo
complexes. Although the architectural arrangement of parts of the Y complex has
been elucidated, it is unclear how exactly it oligomerizes in situ. Here we
combine cryo-electron tomography with mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis,
perturbation experiments and structural modelling to generate, to our knowledge, 
the most comprehensive architectural model of the human nuclear pore complex to
date. Our data suggest previously unknown protein interfaces across Y complexes
and to inner-ring complex members. We show that the transport-channel Nup358
(also known as Ranbp2) has a previously unanticipated role in Y-complex
oligomerization. Our findings blur the established boundaries between scaffold
and transport-channel Nups. We conclude that, similar to coated vesicles, several
copies of the same structural building block--although compositionally
identical--engage in different local sets of interactions and conformations.

Earlier spring leaf unfolding is a frequently observed response of plants to
climate warming. Many deciduous tree species require chilling for dormancy
release, and warming-related reductions in chilling may counteract the advance of
leaf unfolding in response to warming. Empirical evidence for this, however, is
limited to saplings or twigs in climate-controlled chambers. Using long-term in
situ observations of leaf unfolding for seven dominant European tree species at
1,245 sites, here we show that the apparent response of leaf unfolding to climate
warming (ST, expressed in days advance of leaf unfolding per °C warming) has
significantly decreased from 1980 to 2013 in all monitored tree species. Averaged
across all species and sites, ST decreased by 40% from 4.0 ± 1.8 days °C(-1)
during 1980-1994 to 2.3 ± 1.6 days °C(-1) during 1999-2013. The declining ST was 
also simulated by chilling-based phenology models, albeit with a weaker decline
(24-30%) than observed in situ. The reduction in ST is likely to be partly
attributable to reduced chilling. Nonetheless, other mechanisms may also have a
role, such as 'photoperiod limitation' mechanisms that may become ultimately
limiting when leaf unfolding dates occur too early in the season. Our results
provide empirical evidence for a declining ST, but also suggest that the
predicted strong winter warming in the future may further reduce ST and therefore
result in a slowdown in the advance of tree spring phenology.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in a perivascular niche but the specific 
location of this niche remains controversial. HSCs are rare and few can be found 
in thin tissue sections or upon live imaging, making it difficult to
comprehensively localize dividing and non-dividing HSCs. Here, using a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in for the gene Ctnnal1 in mice (hereafter
denoted as α-catulin(GFP)), we discover that α-catulin(GFP) is expressed by only 
0.02% of bone marrow haematopoietic cells, including almost all HSCs. We find
that approximately 30% of α-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells give long-term
multilineage reconstitution of irradiated mice, indicating that
α-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells are comparable in HSC purity to cells obtained
using the best markers currently available. We optically cleared the bone marrow 
to perform deep confocal imaging, allowing us to image thousands of
α-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells and to digitally reconstruct large segments of
bone marrow. The distribution of α-catulin-GFP(+)c-kit(+) cells indicated that
HSCs were more common in central marrow than near bone surfaces, and in the
diaphysis relative to the metaphysis. Nearly all HSCs contacted leptin receptor
positive (Lepr(+)) and Cxcl12(high) niche cells, and approximately 85% of HSCs
were within 10 μm of a sinusoidal blood vessel. Most HSCs, both dividing
(Ki-67(+)) and non-dividing (Ki-67(-)), were distant from arterioles, transition 
zone vessels, and bone surfaces. Dividing and non-dividing HSCs thus reside
mainly in perisinusoidal niches with Lepr(+)Cxcl12(high) cells throughout the
bone marrow.

The battle for survival between bacteria and the viruses that infect them
(phages) has led to the evolution of many bacterial defence systems and
phage-encoded antagonists of these systems. Clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes comprise an
adaptive immune system that is one of the most widespread means by which bacteria
defend themselves against phages. We identified the first examples of proteins
produced by phages that inhibit a CRISPR-Cas system. Here we performed
biochemical and in vivo investigations of three of these anti-CRISPR proteins,
and show that each inhibits CRISPR-Cas activity through a distinct mechanism. Two
block the DNA-binding activity of the CRISPR-Cas complex, yet do this by
interacting with different protein subunits, and using steric or non-steric modes
of inhibition. The third anti-CRISPR protein operates by binding to the Cas3
helicase-nuclease and preventing its recruitment to the DNA-bound CRISPR-Cas
complex. In vivo, this anti-CRISPR can convert the CRISPR-Cas system into a
transcriptional repressor, providing the first example-to our knowledge-of
modulation of CRISPR-Cas activity by a protein interactor. The diverse sequences 
and mechanisms of action of these anti-CRISPR proteins imply an independent
evolution, and foreshadow the existence of other means by which proteins may
alter CRISPR-Cas function.

Influenza A viruses pose a major public health threat by causing seasonal
epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Their epidemiological success relies on
airborne transmission from person to person; however, the viral properties
governing airborne transmission of influenza A viruses are complex. Influenza A
virus infection is mediated via binding of the viral haemagglutinin (HA) to
terminally attached α2,3 or α2,6 sialic acids on cell surface glycoproteins.
Human influenza A viruses preferentially bind α2,6-linked sialic acids whereas
avian influenza A viruses bind α2,3-linked sialic acids on complex glycans on
airway epithelial cells. Historically, influenza A viruses with preferential
association with α2,3-linked sialic acids have not been transmitted efficiently
by the airborne route in ferrets. Here we observe efficient airborne transmission
of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 (H1N1pdm) virus (A/California/07/2009) engineered to
preferentially bind α2,3-linked sialic acids. Airborne transmission was
associated with rapid selection of virus with a change at a single HA site that
conferred binding to long-chain α2,6-linked sialic acids, without loss of
α2,3-linked sialic acid binding. The transmissible virus emerged in
experimentally infected ferrets within 24 hours after infection and was
remarkably enriched in the soft palate, where long-chain α2,6-linked sialic acids
predominate on the nasopharyngeal surface. Notably, presence of long-chain
α2,6-linked sialic acids is conserved in ferret, pig and human soft palate. Using
a loss-of-function approach with this one virus, we demonstrate that the ferret
soft palate, a tissue not normally sampled in animal models of influenza, rapidly
selects for transmissible influenza A viruses with human receptor (α2,6-linked
sialic acids) preference.

Magnesium is a lightweight structural metal but it exhibits low
ductility-connected with unusual, mechanistically unexplained, dislocation and
plasticity phenomena-which makes it difficult to form and use in energy-saving
lightweight structures. We employ long-time molecular dynamics simulations
utilizing a density-functional-theory-validated interatomic potential, and reveal
the fundamental origins of the previously unexplained phenomena. Here we show
that the key 〈c + a〉 dislocation (where 〈c + a〉 indicates the magnitude and
direction of slip) is metastable on easy-glide pyramidal II planes; we find that 
it undergoes a thermally activated, stress-dependent transition to one of three
lower-energy, basal-dissociated immobile dislocation structures, which cannot
contribute to plastic straining and that serve as strong obstacles to the motion 
of all other dislocations. This transition is intrinsic to magnesium, driven by
reduction in dislocation energy and predicted to occur at very high frequency at 
room temperature, thus eliminating all major dislocation slip systems able to
contribute to c-axis strain and leading to the high hardening and low ductility
of magnesium. Enhanced ductility can thus be achieved by increasing the time and 
temperature at which the transition from the easy-glide metastable dislocation to
the immobile basal-dissociated structures occurs. Our results provide the
underlying insights needed to guide the design of ductile magnesium alloys.

Development of functional nanoparticles can be encumbered by unanticipated
material properties and biological events, which can affect nanoparticle
effectiveness in complex, physiologically relevant systems. Despite the advances 
in bottom-up nanoengineering and surface chemistry, reductionist
functionalization approaches remain inadequate in replicating the complex
interfaces present in nature and cannot avoid exposure of foreign materials. Here
we report on the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles enclosed in the plasma
membrane of human platelets, which are a unique population of cellular fragments 
that adhere to a variety of disease-relevant substrates. The resulting
nanoparticles possess a right-side-out unilamellar membrane coating
functionalized with immunomodulatory and adhesion antigens associated with
platelets. Compared to uncoated particles, the platelet membrane-cloaked
nanoparticles have reduced cellular uptake by macrophage-like cells and lack
particle-induced complement activation in autologous human plasma. The cloaked
nanoparticles also display platelet-mimicking properties such as selective
adhesion to damaged human and rodent vasculatures as well as enhanced binding to 
platelet-adhering pathogens. In an experimental rat model of coronary restenosis 
and a mouse model of systemic bacterial infection, docetaxel and vancomycin,
respectively, show enhanced therapeutic efficacy when delivered by the
platelet-mimetic nanoparticles. The multifaceted biointerfacing enabled by the
platelet membrane cloaking method provides a new approach in developing
functional nanoparticles for disease-targeted delivery.

The contribution of rare and low-frequency variants to human traits is largely
unexplored. Here we describe insights from sequencing whole genomes (low read
depth, 7×) or exomes (high read depth, 80×) of nearly 10,000 individuals from
population-based and disease collections. In extensively phenotyped cohorts we
characterize over 24 million novel sequence variants, generate a highly accurate 
imputation reference panel and identify novel alleles associated with levels of
triglycerides (APOB), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDLR and RGAG1) from single-marker and rare variant aggregation
tests. We describe population structure and functional annotation of rare and
low-frequency variants, use the data to estimate the benefits of sequencing for
association studies, and summarize lessons from disease-specific collections.
Finally, we make available an extensive resource, including individual-level
genetic and phenotypic data and web-based tools to facilitate the exploration of 
association results.

The extent to which low-frequency (minor allele frequency (MAF) between 1-5%) and
rare (MAF ≤ 1%) variants contribute to complex traits and disease in the general 
population is mainly unknown. Bone mineral density (BMD) is highly heritable, a
major predictor of osteoporotic fractures, and has been previously associated
with common genetic variants, as well as rare, population-specific, coding
variants. Here we identify novel non-coding genetic variants with large effects
on BMD (ntotal = 53,236) and fracture (ntotal = 508,253) in individuals of
European ancestry from the general population. Associations for BMD were derived 
from whole-genome sequencing (n = 2,882 from UK10K (ref. 10); a population-based 
genome sequencing consortium), whole-exome sequencing (n = 3,549), deep
imputation of genotyped samples using a combined UK10K/1000 Genomes reference
panel (n = 26,534), and de novo replication genotyping (n = 20,271). We
identified a low-frequency non-coding variant near a novel locus, EN1, with an
effect size fourfold larger than the mean of previously reported common variants 
for lumbar spine BMD (rs11692564(T), MAF = 1.6%, replication effect size = +0.20 
s.d., Pmeta = 2 × 10(-14)), which was also associated with a decreased risk of
fracture (odds ratio = 0.85; P = 2 × 10(-11); ncases = 98,742 and
ncontrols = 409,511). Using an En1(cre/flox) mouse model, we observed that
conditional loss of En1 results in low bone mass, probably as a consequence of
high bone turnover. We also identified a novel low-frequency non-coding variant
with large effects on BMD near WNT16 (rs148771817(T), MAF = 1.2%, replication
effect size = +0.41 s.d., Pmeta = 1 × 10(-11)). In general, there was an excess
of association signals arising from deleterious coding and conserved non-coding
variants. These findings provide evidence that low-frequency non-coding variants 
have large effects on BMD and fracture, thereby providing rationale for
whole-genome sequencing and improved imputation reference panels to study the
genetic architecture of complex traits and disease in the general population.

Metazoan development depends on the accurate execution of differentiation
programs that allow pluripotent stem cells to adopt specific fates.
Differentiation requires changes to chromatin architecture and transcriptional
networks, yet whether other regulatory events support cell-fate determination is 
less well understood. Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 in complex with 
its vertebrate-specific substrate adaptor KBTBD8 (CUL3(KBTBD8)) as an essential
regulator of human and Xenopus tropicalis neural crest specification.
CUL3(KBTBD8) monoubiquitylates NOLC1 and its paralogue TCOF1, the mutation of
which underlies the neurocristopathy Treacher Collins syndrome. Ubiquitylation
drives formation of a TCOF1-NOLC1 platform that connects RNA polymerase I with
ribosome modification enzymes and remodels the translational program of
differentiating cells in favour of neural crest specification. We conclude that
ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation is an important feature of
cell-fate determination.

The quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons offers an additional
degree of freedom and topological protection from noise. Photonic OAM states have
therefore been exploited in various applications ranging from studies of quantum 
entanglement and quantum information science to imaging. The OAM states of
electron beams have been shown to be similarly useful, for example in rotating
nanoparticles and determining the chirality of crystals. However, although
neutrons--as massive, penetrating and neutral particles--are important in
materials characterization, quantum information and studies of the foundations of
quantum mechanics, OAM control of neutrons has yet to be achieved. Here, we
demonstrate OAM control of neutrons using macroscopic spiral phase plates that
apply a 'twist' to an input neutron beam. The twisted neutron beams are analysed 
with neutron interferometry. Our techniques, applied to spatially incoherent
beams, demonstrate both the addition of quantum angular momenta along the
direction of propagation, effected by multiple spiral phase plates, and the
conservation of topological charge with respect to uniform phase fluctuations.
Neutron-based studies of quantum information science, the foundations of quantum 
mechanics, and scattering and imaging of magnetic, superconducting and chiral
materials have until now been limited to three degrees of freedom: spin, path and
energy. The optimization of OAM control, leading to well defined values of OAM,
would provide an additional quantized degree of freedom for such studies.

Observations of cometary nuclei have revealed a very limited amount of surface
water ice, which is insufficient to explain the observed water outgassing. This
was clearly demonstrated on comet 9P/Tempel 1, where the dust jets (driven by
volatiles) were only partially correlated with the exposed ice regions. The
observations of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have revealed that activity has a
diurnal variation in intensity arising from changing insolation conditions. It
was previously concluded that water vapour was generated in ice-rich subsurface
layers with a transport mechanism linked to solar illumination, but that has not 
hitherto been observed. Periodic condensations of water vapour very close to, or 
on, the surface were suggested to explain short-lived outbursts seen near sunrise
on comet 9P/Tempel 1. Here we report observations of water ice on the surface of 
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, appearing and disappearing in a cyclic pattern
that follows local illumination conditions, providing a source of localized
activity. This water cycle appears to be an important process in the evolution of
the comet, leading to cyclical modification of the relative abundance of water
ice on its surface.

Submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshift are the most luminous, heavily
star-forming galaxies in the Universe and are characterized by prodigious
emission in the far-infrared, with a flux of at least five millijanskys at a
wavelength of 850 micrometres. They reside in haloes with masses about 10(13)
times that of the Sun, have low gas fractions compared to main-sequence disks at 
a comparable redshift, trace complex environments and are not easily observable
at optical wavelengths. Their physical origin remains unclear. Simulations have
been able to form galaxies with the requisite luminosities, but have otherwise
been unable to simultaneously match the stellar masses, star formation rates, gas
fractions and environments. Here we report a cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy
formation simulation that is able to form a submillimetre galaxy that
simultaneously satisfies the broad range of observed physical constraints. We
find that groups of galaxies residing in massive dark matter haloes have
increasing rates of star formation that peak at collective rates of about
500-1,000 solar masses per year at redshifts of two to three, by which time the
interstellar medium is sufficiently enriched with metals that the region may be
observed as a submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates are
fuelled in part by the infall of a reservoir gas supply enabled by stellar
feedback at earlier times, not through major mergers. With a lifetime of nearly a
billion years, our simulations show that the submillimetre-bright phase of
high-redshift galaxies is prolonged and associated with significant mass buildup 
in early-Universe proto-clusters, and that many submillimetre-bright galaxies are
composed of numerous unresolved components (for which there is some observational
evidence).

Stem cells self-renew and generate specialized progeny through differentiation,
but vary in the range of cells and tissues they generate, a property called
developmental potency. Pluripotent stem cells produce all cells of an organism,
while multipotent or unipotent stem cells regenerate only specific lineages or
tissues. Defining stem-cell potency relies upon functional assays and diagnostic 
transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic states. Here we describe functional and
molecular hallmarks of pluripotent stem cells, propose a checklist for their
evaluation, and illustrate how forensic genomics can validate their provenance.

Alkaloids, secondary metabolites that contain basic nitrogen atoms, are some of
the most well-known biologically active natural products in chemistry and
medicine. Although efficient laboratory synthesis of alkaloids would enable the
study and optimization of their biological properties, their preparation is often
complicated by the basicity and nucleophilicity of nitrogen, its susceptibility
to oxidation, and its ability to alter reaction outcomes in unexpected ways--for 
example, through stereochemical instability and neighbouring group participation.
Efforts to address these issues have led to the invention of a large number of
protecting groups that temper the reactivity of nitrogen; however, the use of
protecting groups typically introduces additional steps and obstacles into the
synthetic route. Alternatively, the use of aromatic nitrogen heterocycles as
synthetic precursors can attenuate the reactivity of nitrogen and streamline
synthetic strategies. Here we use such an approach to achieve a synthesis of the 
complex anti-HIV alkaloid (+)-batzelladine B in nine steps (longest linear
sequence) from simple pyrrole-based starting materials. The route uses several
key transformations that would be challenging or impossible to implement using
saturated nitrogen heterocycles and highlights some of the advantages of
beginning with aromatic reagents.

The elucidation of factors that activate the regeneration of the adult mammalian 
heart is of major scientific and therapeutic importance. Here we found that
epicardial cells contain a potent cardiogenic activity identified as
follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1). Epicardial Fstl1 declines following myocardial
infarction and is replaced by myocardial expression. Myocardial Fstl1 does not
promote regeneration, either basally or upon transgenic overexpression.
Application of the human Fstl1 protein (FSTL1) via an epicardial patch stimulates
cell cycle entry and division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes, improving cardiac
function and survival in mouse and swine models of myocardial infarction. The
data suggest that the loss of epicardial FSTL1 is a maladaptive response to
injury, and that its restoration would be an effective way to reverse myocardial 
death and remodelling following myocardial infarction in humans.

It is commonly assumed, but has rarely been demonstrated, that sex differences in
behaviour arise from sexual dimorphism in the underlying neural circuits.
Parental care is a complex stereotypic behaviour towards offspring that is shared
by numerous species. Mice display profound sex differences in offspring-directed 
behaviours. At their first encounter, virgin females behave maternally towards
alien pups while males will usually ignore the pups or attack them. Here we show 
that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons in the anteroventral
periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the mouse hypothalamus are more numerous in
mothers than in virgin females and males, and govern parental behaviours in a
sex-specific manner. In females, ablating the AVPV TH(+) neurons impairs maternal
behaviour whereas optogenetic stimulation or increased TH expression in these
cells enhance maternal care. In males, however, this same neuronal cluster has no
effect on parental care but rather suppresses inter-male aggression. Furthermore,
optogenetic activation or increased TH expression in the AVPV TH(+) neurons of
female mice increases circulating oxytocin, whereas their ablation reduces
oxytocin levels. Finally, we show that AVPV TH(+) neurons relay a monosynaptic
input to oxytocin-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Our findings
uncover a previously unknown role for this neuronal population in the control of 
maternal care and oxytocin secretion, and provide evidence for a causal
relationship between sexual dimorphism in the adult brain and sex differences in 
parental behaviour.

Blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils provide immune protection against pathogens, 
but may also promote tissue injury in inflammatory diseases. Although neutrophils
are generally considered to be a relatively homogeneous population, evidence for 
heterogeneity is emerging. Under steady-state conditions, neutrophil
heterogeneity may arise from ageing and replenishment by newly released
neutrophils from the bone marrow. Aged neutrophils upregulate CXCR4, a receptor
allowing their clearance in the bone marrow, with feedback inhibition of
neutrophil production via the IL-17/G-CSF axis, and rhythmic modulation of the
haematopoietic stem-cell niche. The aged subset also expresses low levels of
L-selectin. Previous studies have suggested that in vitro-aged neutrophils
exhibit impaired migration and reduced pro-inflammatory properties. Here, using
in vivo ageing analyses in mice, we show that neutrophil pro-inflammatory
activity correlates positively with their ageing whilst in circulation. Aged
neutrophils represent an overly active subset exhibiting enhanced αMβ2 integrin
activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation under inflammatory
conditions. Neutrophil ageing is driven by the microbiota via Toll-like receptor 
and myeloid differentiation factor 88-mediated signalling pathways. Depletion of 
the microbiota significantly reduces the number of circulating aged neutrophils
and dramatically improves the pathogenesis and inflammation-related organ damage 
in models of sickle-cell disease or endotoxin-induced septic shock. These results
identify a role for the microbiota in regulating a disease-promoting neutrophil
subset.

Understanding how species respond to climate change is critical for forecasting
the future dynamics and distribution of pests, diseases and biological diversity.
Although ecologists have long acknowledged species' direct physiological and
demographic responses to climate, more recent work suggests that these direct
responses can be overwhelmed by indirect effects mediated via other interacting
community members. Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of
community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species
combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate. Empirical tests of this 
prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing
interactions between competitors that co-occur today. To explore how species'
responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track
climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along 
a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were
transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their
performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards 
from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on
competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants 
under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the
competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no
effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the
leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional
similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for
novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species' responses to 
climate change accurately.

Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML), bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors 
are being explored as a promising therapeutic avenue in numerous cancers. While
clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological
malignancies, mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly
understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance
in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive
MLL-AF9;Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic
transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant mouse and human leukaemias.
Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in
other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does
not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates
the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key
targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC
repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant
leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC
transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT
signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance
in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and
self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal
that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, 
involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in
response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT
signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET
resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs
as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and,
potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.

Bromodomain and extra terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are first-in-class
targeted therapies that deliver a new therapeutic opportunity by directly
targeting bromodomain proteins that bind acetylated chromatin marks. Early
clinical trials have shown promise, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia, and
therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms is crucial to optimize the
clinical efficacy of these drugs. Here we use primary mouse haematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells immortalized with the fusion protein MLL-AF9 to generate
several single-cell clones that demonstrate resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to 
the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers
cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as
resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated
through increased drug efflux or metabolism, but is shown to emerge from
leukaemia stem cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Chromatin-bound BRD4 is globally
reduced in resistant cells, whereas the expression of key target genes such as
Myc remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to
regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors, in
human and mouse leukaemia cells, is in part a consequence of increased
Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and negative regulation of this pathway results in
restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Together, these
findings provide new insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukaemia,
highlight potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors, and identify
strategies that may enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted
therapies.

hotspot track.

Hotspots are anomalous regions of volcanism at Earth's surface that show no
obvious association with tectonic plate boundaries. Classic examples include the 
Hawaiian-Emperor chain and the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain province. The
majority are believed to form as Earth's tectonic plates move over long-lived
mantle plumes: buoyant upwellings that bring hot material from Earth's deep
mantle to its surface. It has long been recognized that lithospheric thickness
limits the rise height of plumes and, thereby, their minimum melting pressure. It
should, therefore, have a controlling influence on the geochemistry of
plume-related magmas, although unambiguous evidence of this has, so far, been
lacking. Here we integrate observational constraints from surface geology,
geochronology, plate-motion reconstructions, geochemistry and seismology to
ascertain plume melting depths beneath Earth's longest continental hotspot track,
a 2,000-kilometre-long track in eastern Australia that displays a record of
volcanic activity between 33 and 9 million years ago, which we call the Cosgrove 
track. Our analyses highlight a strong correlation between lithospheric thickness
and magma composition along this track, with: (1) standard basaltic compositions 
in regions where lithospheric thickness is less than 110 kilometres; (2) volcanic
gaps in regions where lithospheric thickness exceeds 150 kilometres; and (3)
low-volume, leucitite-bearing volcanism in regions of intermediate lithospheric
thickness. Trace-element concentrations from samples along this track support the
notion that these compositional variations result from different degrees of
partial melting, which is controlled by the thickness of overlying lithosphere.
Our results place the first observational constraints on the sub-continental
melting depth of mantle plumes and provide direct evidence that lithospheric
thickness has a dominant influence on the volume and chemical composition of
plume-derived magmas.

Somaclonal variation arises in plants and animals when differentiated somatic
cells are induced into a pluripotent state, but the resulting clones differ from 
each other and from their parents. In agriculture, somaclonal variation has
hindered the micropropagation of elite hybrids and genetically modified crops,
but the mechanism responsible remains unknown. The oil palm fruit 'mantled'
abnormality is a somaclonal variant arising from tissue culture that drastically 
reduces yield, and has largely halted efforts to clone elite hybrids for oil
production. Widely regarded as an epigenetic phenomenon, 'mantling' has defied
explanation, but here we identify the MANTLED locus using epigenome-wide
association studies of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis. DNA
hypomethylation of a LINE retrotransposon related to rice Karma, in the intron of
the homeotic gene DEFICIENS, is common to all mantled clones and is associated
with alternative splicing and premature termination. Dense methylation near the
Karma splice site (termed the Good Karma epiallele) predicts normal fruit set,
whereas hypomethylation (the Bad Karma epiallele) predicts homeotic
transformation, parthenocarpy and marked loss of yield. Loss of Karma methylation
and of small RNA in tissue culture contributes to the origin of mantled, while
restoration in spontaneous revertants accounts for non-Mendelian inheritance. The
ability to predict and cull mantling at the plantlet stage will facilitate the
introduction of higher performing clones and optimize environmentally sensitive
land resources.

The protein α-synuclein is the main component of Lewy bodies, the
neuron-associated aggregates seen in Parkinson disease and other
neurodegenerative pathologies. An 11-residue segment, which we term NACore,
appears to be responsible for amyloid formation and cytotoxicity of human
α-synuclein. Here we describe crystals of NACore that have dimensions smaller
than the wavelength of visible light and thus are invisible by optical
microscopy. As the crystals are thousands of times too small for structure
determination by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we use micro-electron diffraction
to determine the structure at atomic resolution. The 1.4 Å resolution structure
demonstrates that this method can determine previously unknown protein structures
and here yields, to our knowledge, the highest resolution achieved by any
cryo-electron microscopy method to date. The structure exhibits protofibrils
built of pairs of face-to-face β-sheets. X-ray fibre diffraction patterns show
the similarity of NACore to toxic fibrils of full-length α-synuclein. The NACore 
structure, together with that of a second segment, inspires a model for most of
the ordered portion of the toxic, full-length α-synuclein fibril, presenting
opportunities for the design of inhibitors of α-synuclein fibrils.

ribosomal subunit, initiator transfer RNA and initiation factors (eIF) 2, 3, 1
and 1A, attach to the 5'-terminal region of messenger RNA and scan along it to
the initiation codon. Scanning on structured mRNAs also requires the DExH-box
protein DHX29. Mammalian eIF3 contains 13 subunits and participates in nearly all
steps of translation initiation. Eight subunits having PCI (proteasome, COP9
signalosome, eIF3) or MPN (Mpr1, Pad1, amino-terminal) domains constitute the
structural core of eIF3, to which five peripheral subunits are flexibly linked.
Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of eIF3 in the context of
the DHX29-bound 43S complex, showing the PCI/MPN core at ∼6 Å resolution. It
reveals the organization of the individual subunits and their interactions with
components of the 43S complex. We were able to build near-complete
polyalanine-level models of the eIF3 PCI/MPN core and of two peripheral subunits.
The implications for understanding mRNA ribosomal attachment and scanning are
discussed.

To contend with hazards posed by environmental fluoride, microorganisms export
this anion through F(-)-specific ion channels of the Fluc family. Since the
recent discovery of Fluc channels, numerous idiosyncratic features of these
proteins have been unearthed, including strong selectivity for F(-) over Cl(-)
and dual-topology dimeric assembly. To understand the chemical basis for F(-)
permeation and how the antiparallel subunits convene to form a F(-)-selective
pore, here we solve the crystal structures of two bacterial Fluc homologues in
complex with three different monobody inhibitors, with and without F(-) present, 
to a maximum resolution of 2.1 Å. The structures reveal a surprising
'double-barrelled' channel architecture in which two F(-) ion pathways span the
membrane, and the dual-topology arrangement includes a centrally coordinated
cation, most likely Na(+). F(-) selectivity is proposed to arise from the very
narrow pores and an unusual anion coordination that exploits the quadrupolar
edges of conserved phenylalanine rings.

Assessment of the global burden of disease is based on epidemiological cohort
studies that connect premature mortality to a wide range of causes, including the
long-term health impacts of ozone and fine particulate matter with a diameter
smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5). It has proved difficult to quantify
premature mortality related to air pollution, notably in regions where air
quality is not monitored, and also because the toxicity of particles from various
sources may vary. Here we use a global atmospheric chemistry model to investigate
the link between premature mortality and seven emission source categories in
urban and rural environments. In accord with the global burden of disease for
2010 (ref. 5), we calculate that outdoor air pollution, mostly by PM2.5, leads to
3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.61-4.81) million premature deaths per year
worldwide, predominantly in Asia. We primarily assume that all particles are
equally toxic, but also include a sensitivity study that accounts for
differential toxicity. We find that emissions from residential energy use such as
heating and cooking, prevalent in India and China, have the largest impact on
premature mortality globally, being even more dominant if carbonaceous particles 
are assumed to be most toxic. Whereas in much of the USA and in a few other
countries emissions from traffic and power generation are important, in eastern
USA, Europe, Russia and East Asia agricultural emissions make the largest
relative contribution to PM2.5, with the estimate of overall health impact
depending on assumptions regarding particle toxicity. Model projections based on 
a business-as-usual emission scenario indicate that the contribution of outdoor
air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050.

Ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials exhibit long-range order of
atomic-scale electric or magnetic dipoles that can be switched by applying an
appropriate electric or magnetic field, respectively. Both switching phenomena
form the basis of non-volatile random access memory, but in the ferroelectric
case, this involves destructive electrical reading and in the magnetic case, a
high writing energy is required. In principle, low-power and high-density
information storage that combines fast electrical writing and magnetic reading
can be realized with magnetoelectric multiferroic materials. These materials not 
only simultaneously display ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, but also enable 
magnetic moments to be induced by an external electric field, or electric
polarization by a magnetic field. However, synthesizing bulk materials with both 
long-range orders at room temperature in a single crystalline structure is
challenging because conventional ferroelectricity requires closed-shell d(0) or
s(2) cations, whereas ferromagnetic order requires open-shell d(n) configurations
with unpaired electrons. These opposing requirements pose considerable
difficulties for atomic-scale design strategies such as magnetic ion substitution
into ferroelectrics. One material that exhibits both ferroelectric and magnetic
order is BiFeO3, but its cycloidal magnetic structure precludes bulk
magnetization and linear magnetoelectric coupling. A solid solution of a
ferroelectric and a spin-glass perovskite combines switchable polarization with
glassy magnetization, although it lacks long-range magnetic order. Crystal
engineering of a layered perovskite has recently resulted in room-temperature
polar ferromagnets, but the electrical polarization has not been switchable. Here
we combine ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism at room temperature in a bulk
perovskite oxide, by constructing a percolating network of magnetic ions with
strong superexchange interactions within a structural scaffold exhibiting polar
lattice symmetries at a morphotropic phase boundary (the compositional boundary
between two polar phases with different polarization directions, exemplified by
the PbZrO3-PbTiO3 system) that both enhances polarization switching and permits
canting of the ordered magnetic moments. We expect this strategy to allow the
generation of a range of tunable multiferroic materials.

It has recently been established that the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc)
superconducting state coexists with short-range charge-density-wave order and
quenched disorder arising from dopants and strain. This complex, multiscale phase
separation invites the development of theories of high-temperature
superconductivity that include complexity. The nature of the spatial interplay
between charge and dopant order that provides a basis for nanoscale phase
separation remains a key open question, because experiments have yet to probe the
unknown spatial distribution at both the nanoscale and mesoscale (between atomic 
and macroscopic scale). Here we report micro X-ray diffraction imaging of the
spatial distribution of both short-range charge-density-wave 'puddles' (domains
with only a few wavelengths) and quenched disorder in HgBa2CuO4 + y, the
single-layer cuprate with the highest Tc, 95 kelvin (refs 26-28). We found that
the charge-density-wave puddles, like the steam bubbles in boiling water, have a 
fat-tailed size distribution that is typical of self-organization near a critical
point. However, the quenched disorder, which arises from oxygen interstitials,
has a distribution that is contrary to the usually assumed random, uncorrelated
distribution. The interstitial-oxygen-rich domains are spatially anticorrelated
with the charge-density-wave domains, because higher doping does not favour the
stripy charge-density-wave puddles, leading to a complex emergent geometry of the
spatial landscape for superconductivity.

Relativistic boost as the cause of periodicity in a massive black-hole binary
candidate.

Because most large galaxies contain a central black hole, and galaxies often
merge, black-hole binaries are expected to be common in galactic nuclei. Although
they cannot be imaged, periodicities in the light curves of quasars have been
interpreted as evidence for binaries, most recently in PG 1302-102, which has a
short rest-frame optical period of four years (ref. 6). If the orbital period of 
the black-hole binary matches this value, then for the range of estimated
black-hole masses, the components would be separated by 0.007-0.017 parsecs,
implying relativistic orbital speeds. There has been much debate over whether
black-hole orbits could be smaller than one parsec (ref. 7). Here we report that 
the amplitude and the sinusoid-like shape of the variability of the light curve
of PG 1302-102 can be fitted by relativistic Doppler boosting of emission from a 
compact, steadily accreting, unequal-mass binary. We predict that brightness
variations in the ultraviolet light curve track those in the optical, but with a 
two to three times larger amplitude. This prediction is relatively insensitive to
the details of the emission process, and is consistent with archival ultraviolet 
data. Follow-up ultraviolet and optical observations in the next few years can
further test this prediction and confirm the existence of a binary black hole in 
the relativistic regime.

Thousands of putative biosynthetic genes in Arabidopsis thaliana have no known
function, which suggests that there are numerous molecules contributing to plant 
fitness that have not yet been discovered. Prime among these uncharacterized
genes are cytochromes P450 upregulated in response to pathogens. Here we start
with a single pathogen-induced P450 (ref. 5), CYP82C2, and use a combination of
untargeted metabolomics and coexpression analysis to uncover the complete
biosynthetic pathway to 4-hydroxyindole-3-carbonyl nitrile (4-OH-ICN), a
previously unknown Arabidopsis metabolite. This metabolite harbours cyanogenic
functionality that is unprecedented in plants and exceedingly rare in nature;
furthermore, the aryl cyanohydrin intermediate in the 4-OH-ICN pathway reveals a 
latent capacity for cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. By
expressing 4-OH-ICN biosynthetic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
Nicotiana benthamiana, we reconstitute the complete pathway in vitro and in vivo 
and validate the functions of its enzymes. Arabidopsis 4-OH-ICN pathway mutants
show increased susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae,
consistent with a role in inducible pathogen defence. Arabidopsis has been the
pre-eminent model system for studying the role of small molecules in plant innate
immunity; our results uncover a new branch of indole metabolism distinct from the
canonical camalexin pathway, and support a role for this pathway in the
Arabidopsis defence response. These results establish a more complete framework
for understanding how the model plant Arabidopsis uses small molecules in
pathogen defence.

The Dirac cone underlies many unique electronic properties of graphene and
topological insulators, and its band structure--two conical bands touching at a
single point--has also been realized for photons in waveguide arrays, atoms in
optical lattices, and through accidental degeneracy. Deformation of the Dirac
cone often reveals intriguing properties; an example is the quantum Hall effect, 
where a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau
levels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point, also known as 
the parity-time symmetry breaking point, where two resonances coincide in both
their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive
phenomena such as loss-induced transparency, unidirectional transmission or
reflection, and lasers with reversed pump dependence or single-mode operation.
Dirac cones and exceptional points are connected: it was theoretically suggested 
that certain non-Hermitian perturbations can deform a Dirac cone and spawn a ring
of exceptional points. Here we experimentally demonstrate such an 'exceptional
ring' in a photonic crystal slab. Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the
photonic crystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical
band structure of a Dirac cone resulting from accidental degeneracy, whereas the 
complex eigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band
enclosed by an exceptional ring. This deformation arises from the dissimilar
radiation rates of dipole and quadrupole resonances, which play a role analogous 
to the loss and gain in parity-time symmetric systems. Our results indicate that 
the radiation existing in any open system can fundamentally alter its physical
properties in ways previously expected only in the presence of material loss and 
gain.

Dendritic spines are the major loci of synaptic plasticity and are considered as 
possible structural correlates of memory. Nonetheless, systematic manipulation of
specific subsets of spines in the cortex has been unattainable, and thus, the
link between spines and memory has been correlational. We developed a novel
synaptic optoprobe, AS-PaRac1 (activated synapse targeting photoactivatable
Rac1), that can label recently potentiated spines specifically, and induce the
selective shrinkage of AS-PaRac1-containing spines. In vivo imaging of AS-PaRac1 
revealed that a motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling in a
small subset of neurons. The acquired motor learning was disrupted by the optical
shrinkage of the potentiated spines, whereas it was not affected by the identical
manipulation of spines evoked by a distinct motor task in the same cortical
region. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a newly acquired motor skill
depends on the formation of a task-specific dense synaptic ensemble.

Macromolecular complexes are essential to conserved biological processes, but
their prevalence across animals is unclear. By combining extensive biochemical
fractionation with quantitative mass spectrometry, here we directly examined the 
composition of soluble multiprotein complexes among diverse metazoan models.
Using an integrative approach, we generated a draft conservation map consisting
of more than one million putative high-confidence co-complex interactions for
species with fully sequenced genomes that encompasses functional modules present 
broadly across all extant animals. Clustering reveals a spectrum of conservation,
ranging from ancient eukaryotic assemblies that have probably served cellular
housekeeping roles for at least one billion years, ancestral complexes that have 
accrued contemporary components, and rarer metazoan innovations linked to
multicellularity. We validated these projections by independent co-fractionation 
experiments in evolutionarily distant species, affinity purification and
functional analyses. The comprehensiveness, centrality and modularity of these
reconstructed interactomes reflect their fundamental mechanistic importance and
adaptive value to animal cell systems.

Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity for an individual genotype to produce
different phenotypes in response to environmental variation. Most traits are
plastic, but the degree to which plasticity is adaptive or non-adaptive depends
on whether environmentally induced phenotypes are closer or further away from the
local optimum. Existing theories make conflicting predictions about whether
plasticity constrains or facilitates adaptive evolution. Debate persists because 
few empirical studies have tested the relationship between initial plasticity and
subsequent adaptive evolution in natural populations. Here we show that the
direction of plasticity in gene expression is generally opposite to the direction
of adaptive evolution. We experimentally transplanted Trinidadian guppies
(Poecilia reticulata) adapted to living with cichlid predators to cichlid-free
streams, and tested for evolutionary divergence in brain gene expression patterns
after three to four generations. We find 135 transcripts that evolved parallel
changes in expression within the replicated introduction populations. These
changes are in the same direction exhibited in a native cichlid-free population, 
suggesting rapid adaptive evolution. We find 89% of these transcripts exhibited
non-adaptive plastic changes in expression when the source population was reared 
in the absence of predators, as they are in the opposite direction to the evolved
changes. By contrast, the remaining transcripts exhibiting adaptive plasticity
show reduced population divergence. Furthermore, the most plastic transcripts in 
the source population evolved reduced plasticity in the introduction populations,
suggesting strong selection against non-adaptive plasticity. These results
support models predicting that adaptive plasticity constrains evolution, whereas 
non-adaptive plasticity potentiates evolution by increasing the strength of
directional selection. The role of non-adaptive plasticity in evolution has
received relatively little attention; however, our results suggest that it may be
an important mechanism that predicts evolutionary responses to new environments.

MYC (also known as c-MYC) overexpression or hyperactivation is one of the most
common drivers of human cancer. Despite intensive study, the MYC oncogene remains
recalcitrant to therapeutic inhibition. MYC is a transcription factor, and many
of its pro-tumorigenic functions have been attributed to its ability to regulate 
gene expression programs. Notably, oncogenic MYC activation has also been shown
to increase total RNA and protein production in many tissue and disease contexts.
While such increases in RNA and protein production may endow cancer cells with
pro-tumour hallmarks, this increase in synthesis may also generate new or
heightened burden on MYC-driven cancer cells to process these macromolecules
properly. Here we discover that the spliceosome is a new target of oncogenic
stress in MYC-driven cancers. We identify BUD31 as a MYC-synthetic lethal gene in
human mammary epithelial cells, and demonstrate that BUD31 is a component of the 
core spliceosome required for its assembly and catalytic activity. Core
spliceosomal factors (such as SF3B1 and U2AF1) associated with BUD31 are also
required to tolerate oncogenic MYC. Notably, MYC hyperactivation induces an
increase in total precursor messenger RNA synthesis, suggesting an increased
burden on the core spliceosome to process pre-mRNA. In contrast to normal cells, 
partial inhibition of the spliceosome in MYC-hyperactivated cells leads to global
intron retention, widespread defects in pre-mRNA maturation, and deregulation of 
many essential cell processes. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of 
the spliceosome in vivo impairs survival, tumorigenicity and metastatic
proclivity of MYC-dependent breast cancers. Collectively, these data suggest that
oncogenic MYC confers a collateral stress on splicing, and that components of the
spliceosome may be therapeutic entry points for aggressive MYC-driven cancers.

Whether cancer is maintained by a small number of stem cells or is composed of
proliferating cells with approximate phenotypic equivalency is a central question
in cancer biology. In the stem cell hypothesis, relapse after treatment may occur
by failure to eradicate cancer stem cells. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is
quintessential to this hypothesis. CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that
results from dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the fusion oncoprotein
BCR-ABL. During the chronic phase, this sole genetic abnormality (chromosomal
translocation Ph(+): t(9;22)(q34;q11)) at the stem cell level causes increased
proliferation of myeloid cells without loss of their capacity to differentiate.
Without treatment, most patients progress to the blast phase when additional
oncogenic mutations result in a fatal acute leukaemia made of proliferating
immature cells. Imatinib mesylate and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
that target the kinase activity of BCR-ABL have improved patient survival
markedly. However, fewer than 10% of patients reach the stage of complete
molecular response (CMR), defined as the point when BCR-ABL transcripts become
undetectable in blood cells. Failure to reach CMR results from the inability of
TKIs to eradicate quiescent CML leukaemia stem cells (LSCs). Here we show that
the residual CML LSC pool can be gradually purged by the glitazones, antidiabetic
drugs that are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). 
We found that activation of PPARγ by the glitazones decreases expression of STAT5
and its downstream targets HIF2α and CITED2, which are key guardians of the
quiescence and stemness of CML LSCs. When pioglitazone was given temporarily to
three CML patients in chronic residual disease in spite of continuous treatment
with imatinib, all of them achieved sustained CMR, up to 4.7 years after
withdrawal of pioglitazone. This suggests that clinically relevant cancer
eradication may become a generally attainable goal by combination therapy that
erodes the cancer stem cell pool.

In all domains of life, DNA synthesis occurs bidirectionally from replication
origins. Despite variable rates of replication fork progression, fork convergence
often occurs at specific sites. Escherichia coli sets a 'replication fork trap'
that allows the first arriving fork to enter but not to leave the terminus
region. The trap is set by oppositely oriented Tus-bound Ter sites that block
forks on approach from only one direction. However, the efficiency of fork
blockage by Tus-Ter does not exceed 50% in vivo despite its apparent ability to
almost permanently arrest replication forks in vitro. Here we use data from
single-molecule DNA replication assays and structural studies to show that both
polarity and fork-arrest efficiency are determined by a competition between rates
of Tus displacement and rearrangement of Tus-Ter interactions that leads to
blockage of slower moving replisomes by two distinct mechanisms. To our knowledge
this is the first example where intrinsic differences in rates of individual
replisomes have different biological outcomes.

Eukaryotic DNA replication terminates when replisomes from adjacent replication
origins converge. Termination involves local completion of DNA synthesis,
decatenation of daughter molecules and replisome disassembly. Termination has
been difficult to study because termination events are generally asynchronous and
sequence nonspecific. To overcome these challenges, we paused converging
replisomes with a site-specific barrier in Xenopus egg extracts. Upon removal of 
the barrier, forks underwent synchronous and site-specific termination, allowing 
mechanistic dissection of this process. We show that DNA synthesis does not slow 
detectably as forks approach each other, and that leading strands pass each other
unhindered before undergoing ligation to downstream lagging strands. Dissociation
of the replicative CMG helicase (comprising CDC45, MCM2-7 and GINS) occurs only
after the final ligation step, and is not required for completion of DNA
synthesis, strongly suggesting that converging CMGs pass one another and
dissociate from double-stranded DNA. This termination mechanism allows rapid
completion of DNA synthesis while avoiding premature replisome disassembly.

Integrator is a multi-subunit complex stably associated with the carboxy-terminal
domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Integrator is endowed with a core
catalytic RNA endonuclease activity, which is required for the 3'-end processing 
of non-polyadenylated, RNAPII-dependent, uridylate-rich, small nuclear RNA genes.
Here we examine the requirement of Integrator in the biogenesis of transcripts
derived from distal regulatory elements (enhancers) involved in tissue- and
temporal-specific regulation of gene expression in metazoans. Integrator is
recruited to enhancers and super-enhancers in a stimulus-dependent manner.
Functional depletion of Integrator subunits diminishes the signal-dependent
induction of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and abrogates stimulus-induced
enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Global nuclear run-on and RNAPII profiling
reveals a role for Integrator in 3'-end cleavage of eRNA primary transcripts
leading to transcriptional termination. In the absence of Integrator, eRNAs
remain bound to RNAPII and their primary transcripts accumulate. Notably, the
induction of eRNAs and gene expression responsiveness requires the catalytic
activity of Integrator complex. We propose a role for Integrator in biogenesis of
eRNAs and enhancer function in metazoans.

The mechanochemical protein dynamin is the prototype of the dynamin superfamily
of large GTPases, which shape and remodel membranes in diverse cellular
processes. Dynamin forms predominantly tetramers in the cytosol, which
oligomerize at the neck of clathrin-coated vesicles to mediate constriction and
subsequent scission of the membrane. Previous studies have described the
architecture of dynamin dimers, but the molecular determinants for dynamin
assembly and its regulation have remained unclear. Here we present the crystal
structure of the human dynamin tetramer in the nucleotide-free state. Combining
structural data with mutational studies, oligomerization measurements and Markov 
state models of molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest a mechanism by which
oligomerization of dynamin is linked to the release of intramolecular
autoinhibitory interactions. We elucidate how mutations that interfere with
tetramer formation and autoinhibition can lead to the congenital muscle disorders
Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and centronuclear myopathy, respectively. Notably,
the bent shape of the tetramer explains how dynamin assembles into a right-handed
helical oligomer of defined diameter, which has direct implications for its
function in membrane constriction.

Epigenetic modifiers have fundamental roles in defining unique cellular identity 
through the establishment and maintenance of lineage-specific chromatin and
methylation status. Several DNA modifications such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC) are catalysed by the ten eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine
dioxygenase family members, and the roles of Tet proteins in regulating chromatin
architecture and gene transcription independently of DNA methylation have been
gradually uncovered. However, the regulation of immunity and inflammation by Tet 
proteins independent of their role in modulating DNA methylation remains largely 
unknown. Here we show that Tet2 selectively mediates active repression of
interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcription during inflammation resolution in innate
myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Loss of Tet2 resulted
in the upregulation of several inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, at late
phase during the response to lipopolysaccharide challenge. Tet2-deficient mice
were more susceptible to endotoxin shock and dextran-sulfate-sodium-induced
colitis, displaying a more severe inflammatory phenotype and increased IL-6
production compared to wild-type mice. IκBζ, an IL-6-specific transcription
factor, mediated specific targeting of Tet2 to the Il6 promoter, further
indicating opposite regulatory roles of IκBζ at initial and resolution phases of 
inflammation. For the repression mechanism, independent of DNA methylation and
hydroxymethylation, Tet2 recruited Hdac2 and repressed transcription of Il6 via
histone deacetylation. We provide mechanistic evidence for the gene-specific
transcription repression activity of Tet2 via histone deacetylation and for the
prevention of constant transcription activation at the chromatin level for
resolving inflammation.

More than two hundred individuals developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
worldwide as a result of treatment, typically in childhood, with human cadaveric 
pituitary-derived growth hormone contaminated with prions. Although such
treatment ceased in 1985, iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) continues to emerge because of
the prolonged incubation periods seen in human prion infections. Unexpectedly, in
an autopsy study of eight individuals with iCJD, aged 36-51 years, in four we
found moderate to severe grey matter and vascular amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. The
Aβ deposition in the grey matter was typical of that seen in Alzheimer's disease 
and Aβ in the blood vessel walls was characteristic of cerebral amyloid
angiopathy and did not co-localize with prion protein deposition. None of these
patients had pathogenic mutations, APOE ε4 or other high-risk alleles associated 
with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Examination of a series of 116 patients
with other prion diseases from a prospective observational cohort study showed
minimal or no Aβ pathology in cases of similar age range, or a decade older,
without APOE ε4 risk alleles. We also analysed pituitary glands from individuals 
with Aβ pathology and found marked Aβ deposition in multiple cases. Experimental 
seeding of Aβ pathology has been previously demonstrated in primates and
transgenic mice by central nervous system or peripheral inoculation with
Alzheimer's disease brain homogenate. The marked deposition of parenchymal and
vascular Aβ in these relatively young patients with iCJD, in contrast with other 
prion disease patients and population controls, is consistent with iatrogenic
transmission of Aβ pathology in addition to CJD and suggests that healthy exposed
individuals may also be at risk of iatrogenic Alzheimer's disease and cerebral
amyloid angiopathy. These findings should also prompt investigation of whether
other known iatrogenic routes of prion transmission may also be relevant to Aβ
and other proteopathic seeds associated with neurodegenerative and other human
diseases.

The amount of ice present in clouds can affect cloud lifetime, precipitation and 
radiative properties. The formation of ice in clouds is facilitated by the
presence of airborne ice-nucleating particles. Sea spray is one of the major
global sources of atmospheric particles, but it is unclear to what extent these
particles are capable of nucleating ice. Sea-spray aerosol contains large amounts
of organic material that is ejected into the atmosphere during bubble bursting at
the organically enriched sea-air interface or sea surface microlayer. Here we
show that organic material in the sea surface microlayer nucleates ice under
conditions relevant for mixed-phase cloud and high-altitude ice cloud formation. 
The ice-nucleating material is probably biogenic and less than approximately 0.2 
micrometres in size. We find that exudates separated from cells of the marine
diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana nucleate ice, and propose that organic material
associated with phytoplankton cell exudates is a likely candidate for the
observed ice-nucleating ability of the microlayer samples. Global model
simulations of marine organic aerosol, in combination with our measurements,
suggest that marine organic material may be an important source of ice-nucleating
particles in remote marine environments such as the Southern Ocean, North Pacific
Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean.

Understanding stellar birth requires observations of the clouds in which they
form. These clouds are dense and self-gravitating, and in all existing
observations they are molecular, with H2 the dominant species and carbon monoxide
(CO) the best available tracer. When the abundances of carbon and oxygen are low 
compared with that of hydrogen, and the opacity from dust is also low, as in
primeval galaxies and local dwarf irregular galaxies, CO forms slowly and is
easily destroyed, so it is difficult for it to accumulate inside dense clouds.
Here we report interferometric observations of CO clouds in the local group dwarf
irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM), which has a metallicity that is 13 
per cent of the solar value and 50 per cent lower than the previous CO detection 
threshold. The clouds are tiny compared to the surrounding atomic and H2
envelopes, but they have typical densities and column densities for CO clouds in 
the Milky Way. The normal CO density explains why star clusters forming in dwarf 
irregulars have similar densities to star clusters in giant spiral galaxies. The 
low cloud masses suggest that these clusters will also be low mass, unless some
galaxy-scale compression occurs, such as an impact from a cosmic cloud or other
galaxy. If the massive metal-poor globular clusters in the halo of the Milky Way 
formed in dwarf galaxies, as is commonly believed, then they were probably
triggered by such an impact.

Biomolecular self-assemblies are of great interest to nanotechnologists because
of their functional versatility and their biocompatibility. Over the past decade,
sophisticated single-component nanostructures composed exclusively of nucleic
acids, peptides and proteins have been reported, and these nanostructures have
been used in a wide range of applications, from drug delivery to molecular
computing. Despite these successes, the development of hybrid co-assemblies of
nucleic acids and proteins has remained elusive. Here we use computational
protein design to create a protein-DNA co-assembling nanomaterial whose assembly 
is driven via non-covalent interactions. To achieve this, a homodimerization
interface is engineered onto the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain (ENH), allowing
the dimerized protein complex to bind to two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
molecules. By varying the arrangement of protein-binding sites on the dsDNA, an
irregular bulk nanoparticle or a nanowire with single-molecule width can be
spontaneously formed by mixing the protein and dsDNA building blocks. We
characterize the protein-DNA nanowire using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force
microscopy and X-ray crystallography, confirming that the nanowire is formed via 
the proposed mechanism. This work lays the foundation for the development of new 
classes of protein-DNA hybrid materials. Further applications can be explored by 
incorporating DNA origami, DNA aptamers and/or peptide epitopes into the
protein-DNA framework presented here.

The global extent and distribution of forest trees is central to our
understanding of the terrestrial biosphere. We provide the first spatially
continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale. This map reveals that
the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude 
higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion
exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions
and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density
demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree
densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across
most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over
15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has
fallen by approximately 46% since the start of human civilization.

Transitional fossils informing the origin of turtles are among the most
sought-after discoveries in palaeontology. Despite strong genomic evidence
indicating that turtles evolved from within the diapsid radiation (which includes
all other living reptiles), evidence of the inferred transformation between an
ancestral turtle with an open, diapsid skull to the closed, anapsid condition of 
modern turtles remains elusive. Here we use high-resolution computed tomography
and a novel character/taxon matrix to study the skull of Eunotosaurus africanus, 
a 260-million-year-old fossil reptile from the Karoo Basin of South Africa, whose
distinctive postcranial skeleton shares many unique features with the shelled
body plan of turtles. Scepticism regarding the status of Eunotosaurus as the
earliest stem turtle arises from the possibility that these shell-related
features are the products of evolutionary convergence. Our phylogenetic analyses 
indicate strong cranial support for Eunotosaurus as a critical transitional form 
in turtle evolution, thus fortifying a 40-million-year extension to the turtle
stem and moving the ecological context of its origin back onto land. Furthermore,
we find unexpected evidence that Eunotosaurus is a diapsid reptile in the process
of becoming secondarily anapsid. This is important because categorizing the skull
based on the number of openings in the complex of dermal bone covering the
adductor chamber has long held sway in amniote systematics, and still represents 
a common organizational scheme for teaching the evolutionary history of the
group. These discoveries allow us to articulate a detailed and testable
hypothesis of fenestral closure along the turtle stem. Our results suggest that
Eunotosaurus represents a crucially important link in a chain that will
eventually lead to consilience in reptile systematics, paving the way for
synthetic studies of amniote evolution and development.

Tumour-initiating cells (TICs) are responsible for metastatic dissemination and
clinical relapse in a variety of cancers. Analogies between TICs and normal
tissue stem cells have led to the proposal that activation of the normal
stem-cell program within a tissue serves as the major mechanism for generating
TICs. Supporting this notion, we and others previously established that the Slug 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-inducing transcription factor (EMT-TF), a
member of the Snail family, serves as a master regulator of the
gland-reconstituting activity of normal mammary stem cells, and that forced
expression of Slug in collaboration with Sox9 in breast cancer cells can
efficiently induce entrance into the TIC state. However, these earlier studies
focused on xenograft models with cultured cell lines and involved ectopic
expression of EMT-TFs, often at non-physiological levels. Using genetically
engineered knock-in reporter mouse lines, here we show that normal
gland-reconstituting mammary stem cells residing in the basal layer of the
mammary epithelium and breast TICs originating in the luminal layer exploit the
paralogous EMT-TFs Slug and Snail, respectively, which induce distinct EMT
programs. Broadly, our findings suggest that the seemingly similar stem-cell
programs operating in TICs and normal stem cells of the corresponding normal
tissue are likely to differ significantly in their details.

Biochemical and structural studies have shown that the initiation of RNA
polymerase II transcription proceeds in the following stages: assembly of the
polymerase with general transcription factors and promoter DNA in a 'closed'
preinitiation complex (PIC); unwinding of about 15 base pairs of the promoter DNA
to form an 'open' complex; scanning downstream to a transcription start site;
synthesis of a short transcript, thought to be about 10 nucleotides long; and
promoter escape. Here we have assembled a 32-protein, 1.5-megadalton PIC derived 
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and observe subsequent initiation processes in
real time with optical tweezers. Contrary to expectation, scanning driven by the 
transcription factor IIH involved the rapid opening of an extended transcription 
bubble, averaging 85 base pairs, accompanied by the synthesis of a transcript up 
to the entire length of the extended bubble, followed by promoter escape. PICs
that failed to achieve promoter escape nevertheless formed open complexes and
extended bubbles, which collapsed back to closed or open complexes, resulting in 
repeated futile scanning.

TP53 (which encodes p53 protein) is the most frequently mutated gene among all
human cancers. Prevalent p53 missense mutations abrogate its tumour suppressive
function and lead to a 'gain-of-function' (GOF) that promotes cancer. Here we
show that p53 GOF mutants bind to and upregulate chromatin regulatory genes,
including the methyltransferases MLL1 (also known as KMT2A), MLL2 (also known as 
KMT2D), and acetyltransferase MOZ (also known as KAT6A or MYST3), resulting in
genome-wide increases of histone methylation and acetylation. Analysis of The
Cancer Genome Atlas shows specific upregulation of MLL1, MLL2, and MOZ in p53 GOF
patient-derived tumours, but not in wild-type p53 or p53 null tumours. Cancer
cell proliferation is markedly lowered by genetic knockdown of MLL1 or by
pharmacological inhibition of the MLL1 methyltransferase complex. Our study
reveals a novel chromatin mechanism underlying the progression of tumours with
GOF p53, and suggests new possibilities for designing combinatorial
chromatin-based therapies for treating individual cancers driven by prevalent GOF
p53 mutations.

Dopamine neurons are thought to facilitate learning by comparing actual and
expected reward. Despite two decades of investigation, little is known about how 
this comparison is made. To determine how dopamine neurons calculate prediction
error, we combined optogenetic manipulations with extracellular recordings in the
ventral tegmental area while mice engaged in classical conditioning. Here we
demonstrate, by manipulating the temporal expectation of reward, that dopamine
neurons perform subtraction, a computation that is ideal for reinforcement
learning but rarely observed in the brain. Furthermore, selectively exciting and 
inhibiting neighbouring GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neurons in the ventral
tegmental area reveals that these neurons are a source of subtraction: they
inhibit dopamine neurons when reward is expected, causally contributing to
prediction-error calculations. Finally, bilaterally stimulating ventral tegmental
area GABA neurons dramatically reduces anticipatory licking to conditioned
odours, consistent with an important role for these neurons in reinforcement
learning. Together, our results uncover the arithmetic and local circuitry
underlying dopamine prediction errors.

Resonance fluorescence arises from the interaction of an optical field with a
two-level system, and has played a fundamental role in the development of quantum
optics and its applications. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it entails a wide
range of intriguing phenomena, such as the Mollow-triplet emission spectrum,
photon antibunching and coherent photon emission. One fundamental aspect of
resonance fluorescence--squeezing in the form of reduced quantum fluctuations in 
the single photon stream from an atom in free space--was predicted more than 30
years ago. However, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime,
together with the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low
collection efficiencies, has continued to necessitate stringent experimental
conditions for the observation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent
these issues had to sacrifice antibunching, owing to either stimulated forward
scattering from atomic ensembles or multi-photon transitions inside optical
cavities. Here, we use an artificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling
100-fold improvement of the photon detection rate over the natural atom
counterpart and reach the necessary conditions for the observation of quadrature 
squeezing in single resonance-fluorescence photons. By implementing
phase-dependent homodyne intensity-correlation detection, we demonstrate that the
electric field quadrature variance of resonance fluorescence is three per cent
below the fundamental limit set by vacuum fluctuations, while the photon
statistics remain antibunched. The presence of squeezing and antibunching
simultaneously is a fully non-classical outcome of the wave-particle duality of
photons.

Phytosulfokine (PSK) is a disulfated pentapeptide that has a ubiquitous role in
plant growth and development. PSK is perceived by its receptor PSKR, a
leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). The mechanisms underlying the
recognition of PSK, the activation of PSKR and the identity of the components
downstream of the initial binding remain elusive. Here we report the crystal
structures of the extracellular LRR domain of PSKR in free, PSK- and
co-receptor-bound forms. The structures reveal that PSK interacts mainly with a
β-strand from the island domain of PSKR, forming an anti-β-sheet. The two sulfate
moieties of PSK interact directly with PSKR, sensitizing PSKR recognition of PSK.
Supported by biochemical, structural and genetic evidence, PSK binding enhances
PSKR heterodimerization with the somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases
(SERKs). However, PSK is not directly involved in PSKR-SERK interaction but
stabilizes PSKR island domain for recruitment of a SERK. Our data reveal the
structural basis for PSKR recognition of PSK and allosteric activation of PSKR by
PSK, opening up new avenues for the design of PSKR-specific small molecules.

Most cancers in humans are large, measuring centimetres in diameter, and composed
of many billions of cells. An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly
heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell division. 
What is remarkable about cancers is that virtually every neoplastic cell within a
large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic alterations, with
heterogeneity confined to mutations that emerge late during tumour growth. How
such alterations expand within the spatially constrained three-dimensional
architecture of a tumour, and come to dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has 
been unclear. Here we describe a model for tumour evolution that shows how
short-range dispersal and cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside 
the tumour. We show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within
a large tumour allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass 
in a clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms
can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model
not only provides insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumour growth,
but also suggests that targeting short-range cellular migratory activity could
have marked effects on tumour growth rates.

Metallic osmium (Os) is one of the most exceptional elemental materials, having, 
at ambient pressure, the highest known density and one of the highest cohesive
energies and melting temperatures. It is also very incompressible, but its
high-pressure behaviour is not well understood because it has been studied so far
only at pressures below 75 gigapascals. Here we report powder X-ray diffraction
measurements on Os at multi-megabar pressures using both conventional and
double-stage diamond anvil cells, with accurate pressure determination ensured by
first obtaining self-consistent equations of state of gold, platinum, and
tungsten in static experiments up to 500 gigapascals. These measurements allow us
to show that Os retains its hexagonal close-packed structure upon compression to 
over 770 gigapascals. But although its molar volume monotonically decreases with 
pressure, the unit cell parameter ratio of Os exhibits anomalies at approximately
150 gigapascals and 440 gigapascals. Dynamical mean-field theory calculations
suggest that the former anomaly is a signature of the topological change of the
Fermi surface for valence electrons. However, the anomaly at 440 gigapascals
might be related to an electronic transition associated with pressure-induced
interactions between core electrons. The ability to affect the core electrons
under static high-pressure experimental conditions, even for incompressible
metals such as Os, opens up opportunities to search for new states of matter
under extreme compression.

characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing
and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein
expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a 
specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell
type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived
progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to
acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address
this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly
selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured self-organizing
epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. 
Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously
differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different
abundances. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant 
cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification
in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can
resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly 
sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker 
for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal
cells. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and
investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the
existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel
subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we
then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their
direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant 
population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory 
cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell
types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.

Dysfunction of the intramembrane protease γ-secretase is thought to cause
Alzheimer's disease, with most mutations derived from Alzheimer's disease mapping
to the catalytic subunit presenilin 1 (PS1). Here we report an atomic structure
of human γ-secretase at 3.4 Å resolution, determined by single-particle
cryo-electron microscopy. Mutations derived from Alzheimer's disease affect
residues at two hotspots in PS1, each located at the centre of a distinct four
transmembrane segment (TM) bundle. TM2 and, to a lesser extent, TM6 exhibit
considerable flexibility, yielding a plastic active site and adaptable
surrounding elements. The active site of PS1 is accessible from the convex side
of the TM horseshoe, suggesting considerable conformational changes in nicastrin 
extracellular domain after substrate recruitment. Component protein APH-1 serves 
as a scaffold, anchoring the lone transmembrane helix from nicastrin and
supporting the flexible conformation of PS1. Ordered phospholipids stabilize the 
complex inside the membrane. Our structure serves as a molecular basis for
mechanistic understanding of γ-secretase function.

The plant hormone jasmonate plays crucial roles in regulating plant responses to 
herbivorous insects and microbial pathogens and is an important regulator of
plant growth and development. Key mediators of jasmonate signalling include MYC
transcription factors, which are repressed by jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ)
transcriptional repressors in the resting state. In the presence of active
jasmonate, JAZ proteins function as jasmonate co-receptors by forming a
hormone-dependent complex with COI1, the F-box subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin
E3 ligase. The hormone-dependent formation of the COI1-JAZ co-receptor complex
leads to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors
and release of MYC proteins from transcriptional repression. The mechanism by
which JAZ proteins repress MYC transcription factors and how JAZ proteins switch 
between the repressor function in the absence of hormone and the co-receptor
function in the presence of hormone remain enigmatic. Here we show that
Arabidopsis MYC3 undergoes pronounced conformational changes when bound to the
conserved Jas motif of the JAZ9 repressor. The Jas motif, previously shown to
bind to hormone as a partly unwound helix, forms a complete α-helix that
displaces the amino (N)-terminal helix of MYC3 and becomes an integral part of
the MYC N-terminal fold. In this position, the Jas helix competitively inhibits
MYC3 interaction with the MED25 subunit of the transcriptional Mediator complex. 
Our structural and functional studies elucidate a dynamic molecular switch
mechanism that governs the repression and activation of a major plant hormone
pathway.

Plumes of hot upwelling rock rooted in the deep mantle have been proposed as a
possible origin of hotspot volcanoes, but this idea is the subject of vigorous
debate. On the basis of geodynamic computations, plumes of purely thermal origin 
should comprise thin tails, only several hundred kilometres wide, and be
difficult to detect using standard seismic tomography techniques. Here we
describe the use of a whole-mantle seismic imaging technique--combining accurate 
wavefield computations with information contained in whole seismic
waveforms--that reveals the presence of broad (not thin), quasi-vertical conduits
beneath many prominent hotspots. These conduits extend from the core-mantle
boundary to about 1,000 kilometres below Earth's surface, where some are
deflected horizontally, as though entrained into more vigorous upper-mantle
circulation. At the base of the mantle, these conduits are rooted in patches of
greatly reduced shear velocity that, in the case of Hawaii, Iceland and Samoa,
correspond to the locations of known large ultralow-velocity zones. This
correspondence clearly establishes a continuous connection between such zones and
mantle plumes. We also show that the imaged conduits are robustly broader than
classical thermal plume tails, suggesting that they are long-lived, and may have 
a thermochemical origin. Their vertical orientation suggests very sluggish
background circulation below depths of 1,000 kilometres. Our results should
provide constraints on studies of viscosity layering of Earth's mantle and guide 
further research into thermochemical convection.

Current land surface models assume that groundwater, streamflow and plant
transpiration are all sourced and mediated by the same well mixed water
reservoir--the soil. However, recent work in Oregon and Mexico has shown evidence
of ecohydrological separation, whereby different subsurface compartmentalized
pools of water supply either plant transpiration fluxes or the combined fluxes of
groundwater and streamflow. These findings have not yet been widely tested. Here 
we use hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data ((2)H/(1)H (δ(2)H) and (18)O/(16)O
(δ(18)O)) from 47 globally distributed sites to show that ecohydrological
separation is widespread across different biomes. Precipitation, stream water and
groundwater from each site plot approximately along the δ(2)H/δ(18)O slope of
local precipitation inputs. But soil and plant xylem waters extracted from the 47
sites all plot below the local stream water and groundwater on the meteoric water
line, suggesting that plants use soil water that does not itself contribute to
groundwater recharge or streamflow. Our results further show that, at 80% of the 
sites, the precipitation that supplies groundwater recharge and streamflow is
different from the water that supplies parts of soil water recharge and plant
transpiration. The ubiquity of subsurface water compartmentalization found here, 
and the segregation of storm types relative to hydrological and ecological
fluxes, may be used to improve numerical simulations of runoff generation, stream
water transit time and evaporation-transpiration partitioning. Future land
surface model parameterizations should be closely examined for how vegetation,
groundwater recharge and streamflow are assumed to be coupled.

Negative refractive index and acoustic superlens from multiple scattering in
single negative metamaterials.

Metamaterials, man-made composite media structured on a scale much smaller than a
wavelength, offer surprising possibilities for engineering the propagation of
waves. One of the most interesting of these is the ability to achieve
superlensing--that is, to focus or image beyond the diffraction limit. This
originates from the left-handed behavior--the property of refracting waves
negatively--that is typical of negative index metamaterials. Yet reaching this
goal requires the design of 'double negative' metamaterials, which act
simultaneously on the permittivity and permeability in electromagnetics, or on
the density and compressibility in acoustics; this generally implies the use of
two different kinds of building blocks or specific particles presenting multiple 
overlapping resonances. Such a requirement limits the applicability of double
negative metamaterials, and has, for example, hampered any demonstration of
subwavelength focusing using left-handed acoustic metamaterials. Here we show
that these strict conditions can be largely relaxed by relying on media that
consist of only one type of single resonant unit cell. Specifically, we show with
a simple yet general semi-analytical model that judiciously breaking the symmetry
of a single negative metamaterial is sufficient to turn it into a double negative
one. We then demonstrate that this occurs solely because of multiple scattering
of waves off the metamaterial resonant elements, a phenomenon often disregarded
in these media owing to their subwavelength patterning. We apply our approach to 
acoustics and verify through numerical simulations that it allows the realization
of negative index acoustic metamaterials based on Helmholtz resonators only.
Finally, we demonstrate the operation of a negative index acoustic superlens,
achieving subwavelength focusing and imaging with spot width and resolution 7 and
3.5 times better than the diffraction limit, respectively. Our findings have
profound implications for the physics of metamaterials, highlighting the role of 
their subwavelength crystalline structure, and hence entering the realm of
metamaterial crystals. This widens the scope of possibilities for designing
composite media with novel properties in a much simpler way than has been
possible so far.

Advances in numerical weather prediction represent a quiet revolution because
they have resulted from a steady accumulation of scientific knowledge and
technological advances over many years that, with only a few exceptions, have not
been associated with the aura of fundamental physics breakthroughs. Nonetheless, 
the impact of numerical weather prediction is among the greatest of any area of
physical science. As a computational problem, global weather prediction is
comparable to the simulation of the human brain and of the evolution of the early
Universe, and it is performed every day at major operational centres across the
world.

Methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) require large quantities of copper for
the membrane-bound (particulate) methane monooxygenase. Certain methanotrophs are
also able to switch to using the iron-containing soluble methane monooxygenase to
catalyse methane oxidation, with this switchover regulated by copper. Methane
monooxygenases are nature's primary biological mechanism for suppressing
atmospheric levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Furthermore,
methanotrophs and methane monooxygenases have enormous potential in
bioremediation and for biotransformations producing bulk and fine chemicals, and 
in bioenergy, particularly considering increased methane availability from
renewable sources and hydraulic fracturing of shale rock. Here we discover and
characterize a novel copper storage protein (Csp1) from the methanotroph
Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b that is exported from the cytosol, and stores
copper for particulate methane monooxygenase. Csp1 is a tetramer of four-helix
bundles with each monomer binding up to 13 Cu(I) ions in a previously unseen
manner via mainly Cys residues that point into the core of the bundle. Csp1 is
the first example of a protein that stores a metal within an established
protein-folding motif. This work provides a detailed insight into how
methanotrophs accumulate copper for the oxidation of methane. Understanding this 
process is essential if the wide-ranging biotechnological applications of
methanotrophs are to be realized. Cytosolic homologues of Csp1 are present in
diverse bacteria, thus challenging the dogma that such organisms do not use
copper in this location.

The GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion in a noncoding region of C9orf72 is the most
common cause of sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
frontotemporal dementia. The basis for pathogenesis is unknown. To elucidate the 
consequences of G4C2 repeat expansion in a tractable genetic system, we generated
transgenic fly lines expressing 8, 28 or 58 G4C2-repeat-containing transcripts
that do not have a translation start site (AUG) but contain an open-reading frame
for green fluorescent protein to detect repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)
translation. We show that these transgenic animals display dosage-dependent,
repeat-length-dependent degeneration in neuronal tissues and RAN translation of
dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, as observed in patients with C9orf72-related
disease. This model was used in a large-scale, unbiased genetic screen,
ultimately leading to the identification of 18 genetic modifiers that encode
components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), as well as the machinery that
coordinates the export of nuclear RNA and the import of nuclear proteins.
Consistent with these results, we found morphological abnormalities in the
architecture of the nuclear envelope in cells expressing expanded G4C2 repeats in
vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identified a substantial defect in RNA export
resulting in retention of RNA in the nuclei of Drosophila cells expressing
expanded G4C2 repeats and also in mammalian cells, including aged induced
pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons from patients with C9orf72-related disease.
These studies show that a primary consequence of G4C2 repeat expansion is the
compromise of nucleocytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore, revealing a
novel mechanism of neurodegeneration.

Alcohols as alkylating agents in heteroarene C-H functionalization.

Redox processes and radical intermediates are found in many biochemical
processes, including deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and oxidative DNA damage. One 
of the core principles underlying DNA biosynthesis is the radical-mediated
elimination of H2O to deoxygenate ribonucleotides, an example of 'spin-centre
shift', during which an alcohol C-O bond is cleaved, resulting in a
carbon-centred radical intermediate. Although spin-centre shift is a
well-understood biochemical process, it is underused by the synthetic organic
chemistry community. We wondered whether it would be possible to take advantage
of this naturally occurring process to accomplish mild, non-traditional
alkylation reactions using alcohols as radical precursors. Because conventional
radical-based alkylation methods require the use of stoichiometric oxidants,
increased temperatures or peroxides, a mild protocol using simple and abundant
alkylating agents would have considerable use in the synthesis of diversely
functionalized pharmacophores. Here we describe the development of a dual
catalytic alkylation of heteroarenes, using alcohols as mild alkylating reagents.
This method represents the first, to our knowledge, broadly applicable use of
unactivated alcohols as latent alkylating reagents, achieved via the successful
merger of photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalysis. The value of this
multi-catalytic protocol has been demonstrated through the late-stage
functionalization of the medicinal agents, fasudil and milrinone.

The hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) GGGGCC (G4C2) in C9orf72 is the most
common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia
(FTD). Recent studies support an HRE RNA gain-of-function mechanism of
neurotoxicity, and we previously identified protein interactors for the G4C2 RNA 
including RanGAP1. A candidate-based genetic screen in Drosophila expressing 30
G4C2 repeats identified RanGAP (Drosophila orthologue of human RanGAP1), a key
regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport, as a potent suppressor of
neurodegeneration. Enhancing nuclear import or suppressing nuclear export of
proteins also suppresses neurodegeneration. RanGAP physically interacts with HRE 
RNA and is mislocalized in HRE-expressing flies, neurons from C9orf72 ALS
patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-derived neurons), and in
C9orf72 ALS patient brain tissue. Nuclear import is impaired as a result of HRE
expression in the fly model and in C9orf72 iPSC-derived neurons, and these
deficits are rescued by small molecules and antisense oligonucleotides targeting 
the HRE G-quadruplexes. Nucleocytoplasmic transport defects may be a fundamental 
pathway for ALS and FTD that is amenable to pharmacotherapeutic intervention.

During B-cell development, RAG endonuclease cleaves immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IgH) V, D, and J gene segments and orchestrates their fusion as deletional
events that assemble a V(D)J exon in the same transcriptional orientation as
adjacent Cμ constant region exons. In mice, six additional sets of constant
region exons (CHs) lie 100-200 kilobases downstream in the same transcriptional
orientation as V(D)J and Cμ exons. Long repetitive switch (S) regions precede Cμ 
and downstream CHs. In mature B cells, class switch recombination (CSR) generates
different antibody classes by replacing Cμ with a downstream CH (ref. 2).
Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates CSR by promoting
deamination lesions within Sμ and a downstream acceptor S region; these lesions
are converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by general DNA repair factors.
Productive CSR must occur in a deletional orientation by joining the upstream end
of an Sμ DSB to the downstream end of an acceptor S-region DSB. However, the
relative frequency of deletional to inversional CSR junctions has not been
measured. Thus, whether orientation-specific joining is a programmed mechanistic 
feature of CSR as it is for V(D)J recombination and, if so, how this is achieved 
is unknown. To address this question, we adapt high-throughput genome-wide
translocation sequencing into a highly sensitive DSB end-joining assay and apply 
it to endogenous AID-initiated S-region DSBs in mouse B cells. We show that CSR
is programmed to occur in a productive deletional orientation and does so via an 
unprecedented mechanism that involves in cis Igh organizational features in
combination with frequent S-region DSBs initiated by AID. We further implicate
ATM-dependent DSB-response factors in enforcing this mechanism and provide an
explanation of why CSR is so reliant on the 53BP1 DSB-response factor.

All around the globe, humans have greatly altered the abiotic and biotic
environment with ever-increasing speed. One defining feature of the Anthropocene 
epoch is the erosion of biogeographical barriers by human-mediated dispersal of
species into new regions, where they can naturalize and cause ecological,
economic and social damage. So far, no comprehensive analysis of the global
accumulation and exchange of alien plant species between continents has been
performed, primarily because of a lack of data. Here we bridge this knowledge gap
by using a unique global database on the occurrences of naturalized alien plant
species in 481 mainland and 362 island regions. In total, 13,168 plant species,
corresponding to 3.9% of the extant global vascular flora, or approximately the
size of the native European flora, have become naturalized somewhere on the globe
as a result of human activity. North America has accumulated the largest number
of naturalized species, whereas the Pacific Islands show the fastest increase in 
species numbers with respect to their land area. Continents in the Northern
Hemisphere have been the major donors of naturalized alien species to all other
continents. Our results quantify for the first time the extent of plant
naturalizations worldwide, and illustrate the urgent need for globally integrated
efforts to control, manage and understand the spread of alien species.

DNA origami is a robust assembly technique that folds a single-stranded DNA
template into a target structure by annealing it with hundreds of short 'staple' 
strands. Its guiding design principle is that the target structure is the single 
most stable configuration. The folding transition is cooperative and, as in the
case of proteins, is governed by information encoded in the polymer sequence. A
typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures 
can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield. Although adjusting assembly
conditions or following empirical design rules can improve yield, well-folded
origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures. The problem could
in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood
and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system 
with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable
and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate
energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly
process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the
existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides
information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find 
that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly
cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from
transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can
very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the
design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures.
Expanding the rational design process to include the assembly pathway should thus
enable more reproducible synthesis, particularly when targeting more complex
structures. We anticipate that this expansion will be essential if DNA origami is
to continue its rapid development and become a reliable manufacturing technology.

Synaptotagmin-1 and neuronal SNARE proteins have central roles in evoked
synchronous neurotransmitter release; however, it is unknown how they cooperate
to trigger synaptic vesicle fusion. Here we report atomic-resolution crystal
structures of Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-bound complexes between synaptotagmin-1 and the 
neuronal SNARE complex, one of which was determined with diffraction data from an
X-ray free-electron laser, leading to an atomic-resolution structure with
accurate rotamer assignments for many side chains. The structures reveal several 
interfaces, including a large, specific, Ca(2+)-independent and conserved
interface. Tests of this interface by mutagenesis suggest that it is essential
for Ca(2+)-triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse hippocampal neuronal
synapses and for Ca(2+)-triggered vesicle fusion in a reconstituted system. We
propose that this interface forms before Ca(2+) triggering, moves en bloc as
Ca(2+) influx promotes the interactions between synaptotagmin-1 and the plasma
membrane, and consequently remodels the membrane to promote fusion, possibly in
conjunction with other interfaces.

Phosphorus is required for all life and microorganisms can extract it from their 
environment through several metabolic pathways. When phosphate is in limited
supply, some bacteria are able to use phosphonate compounds, which require
specialized enzymatic machinery to break the stable carbon-phosphorus (C-P) bond.
Despite its importance, the details of how this machinery catabolizes
phosphonates remain unknown. Here we determine the crystal structure of the
240-kilodalton Escherichia coli C-P lyase core complex (PhnG-PhnH-PhnI-PhnJ;
PhnGHIJ), and show that it is a two-fold symmetric hetero-octamer comprising an
intertwined network of subunits with unexpected self-homologies. It contains two 
potential active sites that probably couple phosphonate compounds to ATP and
subsequently hydrolyse the C-P bond. We map the binding site of PhnK on the
complex using electron microscopy, and show that it binds to a conserved
insertion domain of PhnJ. Our results provide a structural basis for
understanding microbial phosphonate breakdown.

A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance
below a superconducting transition temperature, Tc. The highest Tc that has been 
achieved to date is in the copper oxide system: 133 kelvin at ambient pressure
and 164 kelvin at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these
materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional
superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition
temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide 
for achieving high Tc with no theoretical upper bound--all that is needed is a
favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon
coupling, and a high density of states. These conditions can in principle be
fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen, as 
hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the
strong electron-phonon coupling. Numerous calculations support this idea and have
predicted transition temperatures in the range 50-235 kelvin for many hydrides,
but only a moderate Tc of 17 kelvin has been observed experimentally. Here we
investigate sulfur hydride, where a Tc of 80 kelvin has been predicted. We find
that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90
gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of 
the resistivity to zero and a decrease of the transition temperature with
magnetic field, with magnetic susceptibility measurements confirming a Tc of 203 
kelvin. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of Tc in sulfur deuteride is
suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is
consistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase
responsible for high-Tc superconductivity in this system is likely to be H3S,
formed from H2S by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for
the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other
hydrogen-based materials.

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and consists of heterogeneous 
types of tumours that are classified into different histological and molecular
subtypes. PIK3CA and P53 (also known as TP53) are the two most frequently mutated
genes and are associated with different types of human breast cancers. The
cellular origin and the mechanisms leading to PIK3CA-induced tumour heterogeneity
remain unknown. Here we used a genetic approach in mice to define the cellular
origin of Pik3ca-derived tumours and the impact of mutations in this gene on
tumour heterogeneity. Surprisingly, oncogenic Pik3ca(H1047R) mutant expression at
physiological levels in basal cells using keratin (K)5-CreER(T2) mice induced the
formation of luminal oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive/progesterone receptor
(PR)-positive tumours, while its expression in luminal cells using K8-CReER(T2)
mice gave rise to luminal ER(+)PR(+) tumours or basal-like ER(-)PR(-) tumours.
Concomitant deletion of p53 and expression of Pik3ca(H1047R) accelerated tumour
development and induced more aggressive mammary tumours. Interestingly,
expression of Pik3ca(H1047R) in unipotent basal cells gave rise to luminal-like
cells, while its expression in unipotent luminal cells gave rise to basal-like
cells before progressing into invasive tumours. Transcriptional profiling of
cells that underwent cell fate transition upon Pik3ca(H1047R) expression in
unipotent progenitors demonstrated a profound oncogene-induced reprogramming of
these newly formed cells and identified gene signatures characteristic of the
different cell fate switches that occur upon Pik3ca(H1047R) expression in basal
and luminal cells, which correlated with the cell of origin, tumour type and
different clinical outcomes. Altogether our study identifies the cellular origin 
of Pik3ca-induced tumours and reveals that oncogenic Pik3ca(H1047R) activates a
multipotent genetic program in normally lineage-restricted populations at the
early stage of tumour initiation, setting the stage for future intratumoural
heterogeneity. These results have important implications for our understanding of
the mechanisms controlling tumour heterogeneity and the development of new
strategies to block PIK3CA breast cancer initiation.

The adult mouse mammary epithelium contains self-sustained cell lineages that
form the inner luminal and outer basal cell layers, with stem and progenitor
cells contributing to its proliferative and regenerative potential. A key issue
in breast cancer biology is the effect of genomic lesions in specific mammary
cell lineages on tumour heterogeneity and progression. The impact of transforming
events on fate conversion in cancer cells of origin and thus their contribution
to tumour heterogeneity remains largely elusive. Using in situ genetic lineage
tracing and limiting dilution transplantation, we have unravelled the potential
of PIK3CA(H1047R), one of the most frequent mutations occurring in human breast
cancer, to induce multipotency during tumorigenesis in the mammary gland. Here we
show that expression of PIK3CA(H1047R) in lineage-committed basal Lgr5-positive
and luminal keratin-8-positive cells of the adult mouse mammary gland evokes cell
dedifferentiation into a multipotent stem-like state, suggesting this to be a
mechanism involved in the formation of heterogeneous, multi-lineage mammary
tumours. Moreover, we show that the tumour cell of origin influences the
frequency of malignant mammary tumours. Our results define a key effect of
PIK3CA(H1047R) on mammary cell fate in the pre-neoplastic mammary gland and show 
that the cell of origin of PIK3CA(H1047R) tumours dictates their malignancy, thus
revealing a mechanism underlying tumour heterogeneity and aggressiveness.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common cardiac valve disease that affects nearly
1 in 40 individuals. It can manifest as mitral regurgitation and is the leading
indication for mitral valve surgery. Despite a clear heritable component, the
genetic aetiology leading to non-syndromic MVP has remained elusive. Four
affected individuals from a large multigenerational family segregating
non-syndromic MVP underwent capture sequencing of the linked interval on
chromosome 11. We report a missense mutation in the DCHS1 gene, the human
homologue of the Drosophila cell polarity gene dachsous (ds), that segregates
with MVP in the family. Morpholino knockdown of the zebrafish homologue
dachsous1b resulted in a cardiac atrioventricular canal defect that could be
rescued by wild-type human DCHS1, but not by DCHS1 messenger RNA with the
familial mutation. Further genetic studies identified two additional families in 
which a second deleterious DCHS1 mutation segregates with MVP. Both DCHS1
mutations reduce protein stability as demonstrated in zebrafish, cultured cells
and, notably, in mitral valve interstitial cells (MVICs) obtained during mitral
valve repair surgery of a proband. Dchs1(+/-) mice had prolapse of thickened
mitral leaflets, which could be traced back to developmental errors in valve
morphogenesis. DCHS1 deficiency in MVP patient MVICs, as well as in Dchs1(+/-)
mouse MVICs, result in altered migration and cellular patterning, supporting
these processes as aetiological underpinnings for the disease. Understanding the 
role of DCHS1 in mitral valve development and MVP pathogenesis holds potential
for therapeutic insights for this very common disease.

Mitochondria are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including ATP
production, amino acid and lipid biogenesis and breakdown, signalling and
apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to neurodegenerative
diseases, cancer and ageing. Although transcriptional mechanisms that regulate
mitochondrial abundance are known, comparatively little is known about how
mitochondrial function is regulated. Here we identify the metabolite stearic acid
(C18:0) and human transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1; also known as TFRC) as
mitochondrial regulators. We elucidate a signalling pathway whereby C18:0
stearoylates TFR1, thereby inhibiting its activation of JNK signalling. This
leads to reduced ubiquitination of mitofusin via HUWE1, thereby promoting
mitochondrial fusion and function. We find that animal cells are poised to
respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0 levels, with increased C18:0
dietary intake boosting mitochondrial fusion in vivo. Intriguingly, dietary C18:0
supplementation can counteract the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by genetic
defects such as loss of the Parkinson's disease genes Pink or Parkin in
Drosophila. This work identifies the metabolite C18:0 as a signalling molecule
regulating mitochondrial function in response to diet.

Genetic studies have consistently indicated a single common origin of Native
American groups from Central and South America. However, some morphological
studies have suggested a more complex picture, whereby the northeast Asian
affinities of present-day Native Americans contrast with a distinctive morphology
seen in some of the earliest American skeletons, which share traits with
present-day Australasians (indigenous groups in Australia, Melanesia, and island 
Southeast Asia). Here we analyse genome-wide data to show that some Amazonian
Native Americans descend partly from a Native American founding population that
carried ancestry more closely related to indigenous Australians, New Guineans and
Andaman Islanders than to any present-day Eurasians or Native Americans. This
signature is not present to the same extent, or at all, in present-day Northern
and Central Americans or in a ∼12,600-year-old Clovis-associated genome,
suggesting a more diverse set of founding populations of the Americas than
previously accepted.

Understanding the causes of intraplate earthquakes is challenging, as it requires
extending plate tectonic theory to the dynamics of continental deformation.
Seismicity in the western United States away from the plate boundary is clustered
along a meandering, north-south trending 'intermountain' belt. This zone
coincides with a transition from thin, actively deforming to thicker, less
tectonically active crust and lithosphere. Although such structural gradients
have been invoked to explain seismicity localization, the underlying cause of
seismicity remains unclear. Here we show results from improved mantle flow models
that reveal a relationship between seismicity and the rate change of 'dynamic
topography' (that is, vertical normal stress from mantle flow). The associated
predictive skill is greater than that of any of the other forcings we examined.
We suggest that active mantle flow is a major contributor to seismogenic
intraplate deformation, while gravitational potential energy variations have a
minor role. Seismicity localization should occur where convective changes in
vertical normal stress are modulated by lithospheric strength heterogeneities.
Our results on deformation processes appear consistent with findings from other
mobile belts, and imply that mantle flow plays a significant and quantifiable
part in shaping topography, tectonics, and seismic hazard within intraplate
settings.

Doping is a process in which atomic impurities are intentionally added to a host 
material to modify its properties. It has had a revolutionary impact in altering 
or introducing electronic, magnetic, luminescent, and catalytic properties for
several applications, for example in semiconductors. Here we explore and
demonstrate the extension of the concept of substitutional atomic doping to
nanometre-scale crystal doping, in which one nanocrystal is used to replace
another to form doped self-assembled superlattices. Towards this goal, we show
that gold nanocrystals act as substitutional dopants in superlattices of cadmium 
selenide or lead selenide nanocrystals when the size of the gold nanocrystal is
very close to that of the host. The gold nanocrystals occupy random positions in 
the superlattice and their density is readily and widely controllable, analogous 
to the case of atomic doping, but here through nanocrystal self-assembly. We also
show that the electronic properties of the superlattices are highly tunable and
strongly affected by the presence and density of the gold nanocrystal dopants.
The conductivity of lead selenide films, for example, can be manipulated over at 
least six orders of magnitude by the addition of gold nanocrystals and is
explained by a percolation model. As this process relies on the self-assembly of 
uniform nanocrystals, it can be generally applied to assemble a wide variety of
nanocrystal-doped structures for electronic, optical, magnetic, and catalytic
materials.

Since the invention of the first lasers in the visible-light region, research has
aimed to produce short-wavelength lasers that generate coherent X-rays; the
shorter the wavelength, the better the imaging resolution of the laser and the
shorter the pulse duration, leading to better temporal resolution in probe
measurements. Recently, free-electron lasers based on self-amplified spontaneous 
emission have made it possible to generate a hard-X-ray laser (that is, the
photon energy is of the order of ten kiloelectronvolts) in an ångström-wavelength
regime, enabling advances in fields from ultrafast X-ray spectrosopy to X-ray
quantum optics. An atomic laser based on neon atoms and pumped by a soft-X-ray
(that is, a photon energy of less than one kiloelectronvolt) free-electron laser 
has been achieved at a wavelength of 14 nanometres. Here, we use a copper target 
and report a hard-X-ray inner-shell atomic laser operating at a wavelength of 1.5
ångströms. X-ray free-electron laser pulses with an intensity of about 10(19)
watts per square centimetre tuned to the copper K-absorption edge produced
sufficient population inversion to generate strong amplified spontaneous emission
on the copper Kα lines. Furthermore, we operated the X-ray free-electron laser
source in a two-colour mode, with one colour tuned for pumping and the other for 
the seed (starting) light for the laser.

Electrical breakdown sets a limit on the kinetic energy that particles in a
conventional radio-frequency accelerator can reach. New accelerator concepts must
be developed to achieve higher energies and to make future particle colliders
more compact and affordable. The plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) embodies one
such concept, in which the electric field of a plasma wake excited by a bunch of 
charged particles (such as electrons) is used to accelerate a trailing bunch of
particles. To apply plasma acceleration to electron-positron colliders, it is
imperative that both the electrons and their antimatter counterpart, the
positrons, are efficiently accelerated at high fields using plasmas. Although
substantial progress has recently been reported on high-field, high-efficiency
acceleration of electrons in a PWFA powered by an electron bunch, such an
electron-driven wake is unsuitable for the acceleration and focusing of a
positron bunch. Here we demonstrate a new regime of PWFAs where particles in the 
front of a single positron bunch transfer their energy to a substantial number of
those in the rear of the same bunch by exciting a wakefield in the plasma. In the
process, the accelerating field is altered--'self-loaded'--so that about a
billion positrons gain five gigaelectronvolts of energy with a narrow energy
spread over a distance of just 1.3 metres. They extract about 30 per cent of the 
wake's energy and form a spectrally distinct bunch with a root-mean-square energy
spread as low as 1.8 per cent. This ability to transfer energy efficiently from
the front to the rear within a single positron bunch makes the PWFA scheme very
attractive as an energy booster to an electron-positron collider.

Most exoplanetary systems in binary stars are of S-type, and consist of one or
more planets orbiting a primary star with a wide binary stellar companion.
Planetary eccentricities and mutual inclinations can be large, perhaps forced
gravitationally by the binary companion. Earlier work on single planet systems
appealed to the Kozai-Lidov instability wherein a sufficiently inclined binary
orbit excites large-amplitude oscillations in the planet's eccentricity and
inclination. The instability, however, can be quenched by many agents that induce
fast orbital precession, including mutual gravitational forces in a multiplanet
system. Here we report that orbital precession, which inhibits Kozai-Lidov
cycling in a multiplanet system, can become fast enough to resonate with the
orbital motion of a distant binary companion. Resonant binary forcing results in 
dramatic outcomes ranging from the excitation of large planetary eccentricities
and mutual inclinations to total disruption. Processes such as planetary
migration can bring an initially non-resonant system into resonance. As it does
not require special physical or initial conditions, binary resonant driving is
generic and may have altered the architecture of many multiplanet systems. It can
also weaken the multiplanet occurrence rate in wide binaries, and affect planet
formation in close binaries.

In the mammalian retina, processes of approximately 70 types of interneurons form
specific synapses on roughly 30 types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in a
neuropil called the inner plexiform layer. Each RGC type extracts salient
features from visual input, which are sent deeper into the brain for further
processing. The specificity and stereotypy of synapses formed in the inner
plexiform layer account for the feature-detecting ability of RGCs. Here we
analyse the development and function of synapses on one mouse RGC type, called
the W3B-RGC. These cells have the remarkable property of responding when the
timing of the movement of a small object differs from that of the background, but
not when they coincide. Such cells, known as local edge detectors or object
motion sensors, can distinguish moving objects from a visual scene that is also
moving. We show that W3B-RGCs receive strong and selective input from an unusual 
excitatory amacrine cell type known as VG3-AC (vesicular glutamate transporter
3). Both W3B-RGCs and VG3-ACs express the immunoglobulin superfamily recognition 
molecule sidekick 2 (Sdk2), and both loss- and gain-of-function studies indicate 
that Sdk2-dependent homophilic interactions are necessary for the selectivity of 
the connection. The Sdk2-specified synapse is essential for visual responses of
W3B-RGCs: whereas bipolar cells relay visual input directly to most RGCs, the
W3B-RGCs receive much of their input indirectly, via the VG3-ACs. This
non-canonical circuit introduces a delay into the pathway from photoreceptors in 
the centre of the receptive field to W3B-RGCs, which could improve their ability 
to judge the synchrony of local and global motion.

Cell mixing induced by myc is required for competitive tissue invasion and
destruction.

Cell-cell intercalation is used in several developmental processes to shape the
normal body plan. There is no clear evidence that intercalation is involved in
pathologies. Here we use the proto-oncogene myc to study a process analogous to
early phase of tumour expansion: myc-induced cell competition. Cell competition
is a conserved mechanism driving the elimination of slow-proliferating cells
(so-called 'losers') by faster-proliferating neighbours (so-called 'winners')
through apoptosis and is important in preventing developmental malformations and 
maintain tissue fitness. Here we show, using long-term live imaging of myc-driven
competition in the Drosophila pupal notum and in the wing imaginal disc, that the
probability of elimination of loser cells correlates with the surface of contact 
shared with winners. As such, modifying loser-winner interface morphology can
modulate the strength of competition. We further show that elimination of loser
clones requires winner-loser cell mixing through cell-cell intercalation. Cell
mixing is driven by differential growth and the high tension at winner-winner
interfaces relative to winner-loser and loser-loser interfaces, which leads to a 
preferential stabilization of winner-loser contacts and reduction of clone
compactness over time. Differences in tension are generated by a relative
difference in F-actin levels between loser and winner junctions, induced by
differential levels of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Our results establish the first link between cell-cell
intercalation induced by a proto-oncogene and how it promotes invasiveness and
destruction of healthy tissues.

Chloroplasts arose from cyanobacteria, mitochondria arose from proteobacteria.
Both organelles have conserved their prokaryotic biochemistry, but their genomes 
are reduced, and most organelle proteins are encoded in the nucleus.
Endosymbiotic theory posits that bacterial genes in eukaryotic genomes entered
the eukaryotic lineage via organelle ancestors. It predicts episodic influx of
prokaryotic genes into the eukaryotic lineage, with acquisition corresponding to 
endosymbiotic events. Eukaryotic genome sequences, however, increasingly
implicate lateral gene transfer, both from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and among
eukaryotes, as a source of gene content variation in eukaryotic genomes, which
predicts continuous, lineage-specific acquisition of prokaryotic genes in
divergent eukaryotic groups. Here we discriminate between these two alternatives 
by clustering and phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic gene families having
prokaryotic homologues. Our results indicate (1) that gene transfer from bacteria
to eukaryotes is episodic, as revealed by gene distributions, and coincides with 
major evolutionary transitions at the origin of chloroplasts and mitochondria;
(2) that gene inheritance in eukaryotes is vertical, as revealed by extensive
topological comparison, sparse gene distributions stemming from differential
loss; and (3) that continuous, lineage-specific lateral gene transfer, although
it sometimes occurs, does not contribute to long-term gene content evolution in
eukaryotic genomes.

Multimetallic catalysed cross-coupling of aryl bromides with aryl triflates.

The advent of transition-metal catalysed strategies for forming new carbon-carbon
bonds has revolutionized the field of organic chemistry, enabling the efficient
synthesis of ligands, materials, and biologically active molecules. In cases
where a single metal fails to promote a selective or efficient transformation,
the synergistic cooperation of two distinct catalysts--multimetallic
catalysis--can be used instead. Many important reactions rely on multimetallic
catalysis, such as the Wacker oxidation of olefins and the Sonogashira coupling
of alkynes with aryl halides, but this approach has largely been limited to the
use of metals with distinct reactivities, with only one metal catalyst undergoing
oxidative addition. Here, we demonstrate that cooperativity between two group 10 
metal catalysts--(bipyridine)nickel and
(1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane)palladium--enables a general cross-Ullmann
reaction (the cross-coupling of two different aryl electrophiles). Our method
couples aryl bromides with aryl triflates directly, eliminating the use of
arylmetal reagents and avoiding the challenge of differentiating between multiple
carbon-hydrogen bonds that is required for direct arylation methods. Selectivity 
can be achieved without an excess of either substrate and originates from the
orthogonal reactivity of the two catalysts and the relative stability of the two 
arylmetal intermediates. While (1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane)palladium
reacts preferentially with aryl triflates to afford a persistent intermediate,
(bipyridine)nickel reacts preferentially with aryl bromides to form a transient, 
reactive intermediate. Although each catalyst forms less than 5 per cent
cross-coupled product in isolation, together they are able to achieve a yield of 
up to 94 per cent. Our results reveal a new method for the synthesis of biaryls, 
heteroaryls, and dienes, as well as a general mechanism for the selective
transfer of ligands between two metal catalysts. We anticipate that this reaction
will simplify the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, many of which are currently made 
with pre-formed organometallic reagents, and lead to the discovery of new
multimetallic reactions.

The flipping of membrane-embedded lipids containing large, polar head groups is
slow and energetically unfavourable, and is therefore catalysed by flippases, the
mechanisms of which are unknown. A prominent example of a flipping reaction is
the translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides that serve as donors in
N-linked protein glycosylation. In Campylobacter jejuni, this process is
catalysed by the ABC transporter PglK. Here we present a mechanism of
PglK-catalysed lipid-linked oligosaccharide flipping based on crystal structures 
in distinct states, a newly devised in vitro flipping assay, and in vivo studies.
PglK can adopt inward- and outward-facing conformations in vitro, but only
outward-facing states are required for flipping. While the
pyrophosphate-oligosaccharide head group of lipid-linked oligosaccharides enters 
the translocation cavity and interacts with positively charged side chains, the
lipidic polyprenyl tail binds and activates the transporter but remains exposed
to the lipid bilayer during the reaction. The proposed mechanism is distinct from
the classical alternating-access model applied to other transporters.

Since its discovery in 1989, efforts to grow clinical isolates of the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) in cell culture have met with limited success. Only the JFH-1 isolate
has the capacity to replicate efficiently in cultured hepatoma cells without cell
culture-adaptive mutations. We hypothesized that cultured cells lack one or more 
factors required for the replication of clinical isolates. To identify the
missing factors, we transduced Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells with a pooled
lentivirus-based human complementary DNA (cDNA) library, transfected the cells
with HCV subgenomic replicons lacking adaptive mutations, and selected for stable
replicon colonies. This led to the identification of a single cDNA, SEC14L2, that
enabled RNA replication of diverse HCV genotypes in several hepatoma cell lines. 
This effect was dose-dependent, and required the continuous presence of SEC14L2. 
Full-length HCV genomes also replicated and produced low levels of infectious
virus. Remarkably, SEC14L2-expressing Huh-7.5 cells also supported HCV
replication following inoculation with patient sera. Mechanistic studies suggest 
that SEC14L2 promotes HCV infection by enhancing vitamin E-mediated protection
against lipid peroxidation. This provides a foundation for development of in
vitro replication systems for all HCV isolates, creating a useful platform to
dissect the mechanisms by which cell culture-adaptive mutations act.

The sudden appearance of the neural crest and neurogenic placodes in early
branching vertebrates has puzzled biologists for over a century. These embryonic 
tissues contribute to the development of the cranium and associated sensory
organs, which were crucial for the evolution of the vertebrate "new head". A
previous study suggests that rudimentary neural crest cells existed in ancestral 
chordates. However, the evolutionary origins of neurogenic placodes have remained
obscure owing to a paucity of embryonic data from tunicates, the closest living
relatives to those early vertebrates. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona
intestinalis exhibits a proto-placodal ectoderm (PPE) that requires inhibition of
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and expresses the key regulatory determinant
Six1/2 and its co-factor Eya, a developmental process conserved across
vertebrates. The Ciona PPE is shown to produce ciliated neurons that express
genes for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a G-protein-coupled receptor for
relaxin-3 (RXFP3) and a functional cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA), which 
suggests dual chemosensory and neurosecretory activities. These observations
provide evidence that Ciona has a neurogenic proto-placode, which forms neurons
that appear to be related to those derived from the olfactory placode and
hypothalamic neurons of vertebrates. We discuss the possibility that the
PPE-derived GnRH neurons of Ciona resemble an ancestral cell type, a progenitor
to the complex neuronal circuit that integrates sensory information and
neuroendocrine functions in vertebrates.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane
receptors in eukaryotes. Crystal structures have provided insight into GPCR
interactions with ligands and G proteins, but our understanding of the
conformational dynamics of activation is incomplete. Metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluRs) are dimeric class C GPCRs that modulate neuronal excitability,
synaptic plasticity, and serve as drug targets for neurological disorders. A
'clamshell' ligand-binding domain (LBD), which contains the ligand-binding site, 
is coupled to the transmembrane domain via a cysteine-rich domain, and LBD
closure seems to be the first step in activation. Crystal structures of isolated 
mGluR LBD dimers led to the suggestion that activation also involves a
reorientation of the dimer interface from a 'relaxed' to an 'active' state, but
the relationship between ligand binding, LBD closure and dimer interface
rearrangement in activation remains unclear. Here we use single-molecule
fluorescence resonance energy transfer to probe the activation mechanism of
full-length mammalian group II mGluRs. We show that the LBDs interconvert between
three conformations: resting, activated and a short-lived intermediate state.
Orthosteric agonists induce transitions between these conformational states, with
efficacy determined by occupancy of the active conformation. Unlike mGluR2,
mGluR3 displays basal dynamics, which are Ca(2+)-dependent and lead to basal
protein activation. Our results support a general mechanism for the activation of
mGluRs in which agonist binding induces closure of the LBDs, followed by dimer
interface reorientation. Our experimental strategy should be widely applicable to
study conformational dynamics in GPCRs and other membrane proteins.

Termination of protein synthesis occurs when a translating ribosome encounters
one of three universally conserved stop codons: UAA, UAG or UGA. Release factors 
recognize stop codons in the ribosomal A-site to mediate release of the nascent
chain and recycling of the ribosome. Bacteria decode stop codons using two
separate release factors with differing specificities for the second and third
bases. By contrast, eukaryotes rely on an evolutionarily unrelated omnipotent
release factor (eRF1) to recognize all three stop codons. The molecular basis of 
eRF1 discrimination for stop codons over sense codons is not known. Here we
present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures at 3.5-3.8 Å resolution of 
mammalian ribosomal complexes containing eRF1 interacting with each of the three 
stop codons in the A-site. Binding of eRF1 flips nucleotide A1825 of 18S
ribosomal RNA so that it stacks on the second and third stop codon bases. This
configuration pulls the fourth position base into the A-site, where it is
stabilized by stacking against G626 of 18S rRNA. Thus, eRF1 exploits two rRNA
nucleotides also used during transfer RNA selection to drive messenger RNA
compaction. In this compacted mRNA conformation, stop codons are favoured by a
hydrogen-bonding network formed between rRNA and essential eRF1 residues that
constrains the identity of the bases. These results provide a molecular framework
for eukaryotic stop codon recognition and have implications for future studies on
the mechanisms of canonical and premature translation termination.

Most of the mitochondrial proteome originates from nuclear genes and is
transported into the mitochondria after synthesis in the cytosol. Complex
machineries which maintain the specificity of protein import and sorting include 
the TIM23 translocase responsible for the transfer of precursor proteins into the
matrix, and the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly (MIA)
machinery required for the biogenesis of intermembrane space proteins.
Dysfunction of mitochondrial protein sorting pathways results in diminishing
specific substrate proteins, followed by systemic pathology of the organelle and 
organismal death. The cellular responses caused by accumulation of mitochondrial 
precursor proteins in the cytosol are mainly unknown. Here we present a
comprehensive picture of the changes in the cellular transcriptome and proteome
in response to a mitochondrial import defect and precursor over-accumulation
stress. Pathways were identified that protect the cell against mitochondrial
biogenesis defects by inhibiting protein synthesis and by activation of the
proteasome, a major machine for cellular protein clearance. Proteasomal activity 
is modulated in proportion to the quantity of mislocalized mitochondrial
precursor proteins in the cytosol. We propose that this type of unfolded protein 
response activated by mistargeting of proteins (UPRam) is beneficial for the
cells. UPRam provides a means for buffering the consequences of physiological
slowdown in mitochondrial protein import and for counteracting pathologies that
are caused or contributed by mitochondrial dysfunction.

Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles whose dysfunction leads to
neuromuscular degeneration and ageing. The multi-functionality poses a great
challenge for understanding the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction
causes specific pathologies. Among the leading mitochondrial mediators of cell
death are energy depletion, free radical production, defects in iron-sulfur
cluster biosynthesis, the release of pro-apoptotic and non-cell-autonomous
signalling molecules, and altered stress signalling. Here we identify a new
pathway of mitochondria-mediated cell death in yeast. This pathway was named
mitochondrial precursor over-accumulation stress (mPOS), and is characterized by 
aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial precursors in the cytosol. mPOS can be
triggered by clinically relevant mitochondrial damage that is not limited to the 
core machineries of protein import. We also discover a large network of genes
that suppress mPOS, by modulating ribosomal biogenesis, messenger RNA decapping, 
transcript-specific translation, protein chaperoning and turnover. In response to
mPOS, several ribosome-associated proteins were upregulated, including Gis2 and
Nog2, which promote cap-independent translation and inhibit the nuclear export of
the 60S ribosomal subunit, respectively. Gis2 and Nog2 upregulation promotes cell
survival, which may be part of a feedback loop that attenuates mPOS. Our data
indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes directly to cytosolic
proteostatic stress, and provide an explanation for the association between these
two hallmarks of degenerative diseases and ageing. The results are relevant to
understanding diseases (for example, spinocerebellar ataxia, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and myotonic dystrophy) that involve mutations within the
anti-degenerative network.

Cell division requires the precise coordination of chromosome segregation and
cytokinesis. This coordination is achieved by the recruitment of an actomyosin
regulator, Ect2, to overlapping microtubules at the centre of the elongating
anaphase spindle. Ect2 then signals to the overlying cortex to promote the
assembly and constriction of an actomyosin ring between segregating chromosomes. 
Here, by studying division in proliferating Drosophila and human cells, we
demonstrate the existence of a second, parallel signalling pathway, which
triggers the relaxation of the polar cell cortex at mid anaphase. This is
independent of furrow formation, centrosomes and microtubules and, instead,
depends on PP1 phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 (refs 2, 3). As
separating chromosomes move towards the polar cortex at mid anaphase,
kinetochore-localized PP1-Sds22 helps to break cortical symmetry by inducing the 
dephosphorylation and inactivation of ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins at cell
poles. This promotes local softening of the cortex, facilitating anaphase
elongation and orderly cell division. In summary, this identifies a conserved
kinetochore-based phosphatase signal and substrate, which function together to
link anaphase chromosome movements to cortical polarization, thereby coupling
chromosome segregation to cell division.

The infiltration of fluids into continental lithospheric mantle is a key
mechanism for controlling abrupt changes in the chemical and physical properties 
of the lithospheric root, as well as diamond formation, yet the origin and
composition of the fluids involved are still poorly constrained. Such fluids are 
trapped within diamonds when they form and so diamonds provide a unique means of 
directly characterizing the fluids that percolate through the deep continental
lithospheric mantle. Here we show a clear chemical evolutionary trend,
identifying saline fluids as parental to silicic and carbonatitic deep mantle
melts, in diamonds from the Northwest Territories, Canada. Fluid-rock interaction
along with in situ melting cause compositional transitions, as the saline fluids 
traverse mixed peridotite-eclogite lithosphere. Moreover, the chemistry of the
parental saline fluids--especially their strontium isotopic compositions--and the
timing of host diamond formation suggest that a subducting Mesozoic plate under
western North America is the source of the fluids. Our results imply a strong
association between subduction, mantle metasomatism and fluid-rich diamond
formation, emphasizing the importance of subduction-derived fluids in affecting
the composition of the deep lithospheric mantle.

Nearly three-quarters of the growth in global carbon emissions from the burning
of fossil fuels and cement production between 2010 and 2012 occurred in China.
Yet estimates of Chinese emissions remain subject to large uncertainty;
inventories of China's total fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2008 differ by 0.3
gigatonnes of carbon, or 15 per cent. The primary sources of this uncertainty are
conflicting estimates of energy consumption and emission factors, the latter
being uncertain because of very few actual measurements representative of the mix
of Chinese fuels. Here we re-evaluate China's carbon emissions using updated and 
harmonized energy consumption and clinker production data and two new and
comprehensive sets of measured emission factors for Chinese coal. We find that
total energy consumption in China was 10 per cent higher in 2000-2012 than the
value reported by China's national statistics, that emission factors for Chinese 
coal are on average 40 per cent lower than the default values recommended by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and that emissions from China's cement
production are 45 per cent less than recent estimates. Altogether, our revised
estimate of China's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement
production is 2.49 gigatonnes of carbon (2 standard deviations = ±7.3 per cent)
in 2013, which is 14 per cent lower than the emissions reported by other
prominent inventories. Over the full period 2000 to 2013, our revised estimates
are 2.9 gigatonnes of carbon less than previous estimates of China's cumulative
carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that overestimation of China's emissions
in 2000-2013 may be larger than China's estimated total forest sink in 1990-2007 
(2.66 gigatonnes of carbon) or China's land carbon sink in 2000-2009 (2.6
gigatonnes of carbon).

Growing the gas-giant planets by the gradual accumulation of pebbles.

It is widely held that the first step in forming gas-giant planets, such as
Jupiter and Saturn, was the production of solid 'cores' each with a mass roughly 
ten times that of the Earth. Getting the cores to form before the solar nebula
dissipates (in about one to ten million years; ref. 3) has been a major challenge
for planet formation models. Recently models have emerged in which 'pebbles'
(centimetre-to-metre-sized objects) are first concentrated by aerodynamic drag
and then gravitationally collapse to form objects 100 to 1,000 kilometres in
size. These 'planetesimals' can then efficiently accrete left-over pebbles and
directly form the cores of giant planets. This model is known as 'pebble
accretion'; theoretically, it can produce cores of ten Earth masses in only a few
thousand years. Unfortunately, full simulations of this process show that, rather
than creating a few such cores, it produces a population of hundreds of
Earth-mass objects that are inconsistent with the structure of the Solar System. 
Here we report that this difficulty can be overcome if pebbles form slowly enough
to allow the planetesimals to gravitationally interact with one another. In this 
situation, the largest planetesimals have time to scatter their smaller siblings 
out of the disk of pebbles, thereby stifling their growth. Our models show that, 
for a large and physically reasonable region of parameter space, this typically
leads to the formation of one to four gas giants between 5 and 15 astronomical
units from the Sun, in agreement with the observed structure of the Solar System.

Tropical mountains are hot spots of biodiversity and endemism, but the
evolutionary origins of their unique biotas are poorly understood. In varying
degrees, local and regional extinction, long-distance colonization, and local
recruitment may all contribute to the exceptional character of these communities.
Also, it is debated whether mountain endemics mostly originate from local lowland
taxa, or from lineages that reach the mountain by long-range dispersal from cool 
localities elsewhere. Here we investigate the evolutionary routes to endemism by 
sampling an entire tropical mountain biota on the 4,095-metre-high Mount Kinabalu
in Sabah, East Malaysia. We discover that most of its unique biodiversity is
younger than the mountain itself (6 million years), and comprises a mix of
immigrant pre-adapted lineages and descendants from local lowland ancestors,
although substantial shifts from lower to higher vegetation zones in this latter 
group were rare. These insights could improve forecasts of the likelihood of
extinction and 'evolutionary rescue' in montane biodiversity hot spots under
climate change scenarios.

Protein aggregates and damaged organelles are tagged with ubiquitin chains to
trigger selective autophagy. To initiate mitophagy, the ubiquitin kinase PINK1
phosphorylates ubiquitin to activate the ubiquitin ligase parkin, which builds
ubiquitin chains on mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, where they act to
recruit autophagy receptors. Using genome editing to knockout five autophagy
receptors in HeLa cells, here we show that two receptors previously linked to
xenophagy, NDP52 and optineurin, are the primary receptors for PINK1- and
parkin-mediated mitophagy. PINK1 recruits NDP52 and optineurin, but not p62, to
mitochondria to activate mitophagy directly, independently of parkin. Once
recruited to mitochondria, NDP52 and optineurin recruit the autophagy factors
ULK1, DFCP1 and WIPI1 to focal spots proximal to mitochondria, revealing a
function for these autophagy receptors upstream of LC3. This supports a new model
in which PINK1-generated phospho-ubiquitin serves as the autophagy signal on
mitochondria, and parkin then acts to amplify this signal. This work also
suggests direct and broader roles for ubiquitin phosphorylation in other
autophagy pathways.

Transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions have become one of the most
used carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming reactions in chemical
synthesis. Recently, nickel catalysis has been shown to participate in a wide
variety of C-C bond-forming reactions, most notably Negishi, Suzuki-Miyaura,
Stille, Kumada and Hiyama couplings. Despite the tremendous advances in C-C
fragment couplings, the ability to forge C-O bonds in a general fashion via
nickel catalysis has been largely unsuccessful. The challenge for nickel-mediated
alcohol couplings has been the mechanistic requirement for the critical C-O
bond-forming step (formally known as the reductive elimination step) to occur via
a Ni(III) alkoxide intermediate. Here we demonstrate that visible-light-excited
photoredox catalysts can modulate the preferred oxidation states of nickel
alkoxides in an operative catalytic cycle, thereby providing transient access to 
Ni(III) species that readily participate in reductive elimination. Using this
synergistic merger of photoredox and nickel catalysis, we have developed a highly
efficient and general carbon-oxygen coupling reaction using abundant alcohols and
aryl bromides. More notably, we have developed a general strategy to 'switch on' 
important yet elusive organometallic mechanisms via oxidation state modulations
using only weak light and single-electron-transfer catalysts.

In real-time quantum feedback protocols, the record of a continuous measurement
is used to stabilize a desired quantum state. Recent years have seen successful
applications of these protocols in a variety of well-isolated micro-systems,
including microwave photons and superconducting qubits. However, stabilizing the 
quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a mechanical oscillator,
remains very challenging: the main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which
places stringent requirements on the timescale in which the state must be
measured. Here we describe a position sensor that is capable of resolving the
zero-point motion of a solid-state, 4.3-megahertz nanomechanical oscillator in
the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a basic requirement for real-time
(Markovian) quantum feedback control tasks, such as ground-state preparation. The
sensor is based on evanescent optomechanical coupling to a high-Q microcavity,
and achieves an imprecision four orders of magnitude below that at the standard
quantum limit for a weak continuous position measurement--a 100-fold improvement 
over previous reports--while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product that 
is within a factor of five of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit. As a
demonstration of its utility, we use the measurement as an error signal with
which to feedback cool the oscillator. Using radiation pressure as an actuator,
the oscillator is cold damped with high efficiency: from a cryogenic-bath
temperature of 4.4 kelvin to an effective value of 1.1 ± 0.1 millikelvin,
corresponding to a mean phonon number of 5.3 ± 0.6 (that is, a ground-state
probability of 16 per cent). Our results set a new benchmark for the performance 
of a linear position sensor, and signal the emergence of mechanical oscillators
as practical subjects for measurement-based quantum control.

The typical response of the adult mammalian pulmonary circulation to a low oxygen
environment is vasoconstriction and structural remodelling of pulmonary
arterioles, leading to chronic elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (pulmonary 
hypertension) and right ventricular hypertrophy. Some mammals, however, exhibit
genetic resistance to hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. We used a congenic 
breeding program and comparative genomics to exploit this variation in the rat
and identified the gene Slc39a12 as a major regulator of hypoxia-induced
pulmonary vascular remodelling. Slc39a12 encodes the zinc transporter ZIP12. Here
we report that ZIP12 expression is increased in many cell types, including
endothelial, smooth muscle and interstitial cells, in the remodelled pulmonary
arterioles of rats, cows and humans susceptible to hypoxia-induced pulmonary
hypertension. We show that ZIP12 expression in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle
cells is hypoxia dependent and that targeted inhibition of ZIP12 inhibits the
rise in intracellular labile zinc in hypoxia-exposed pulmonary vascular smooth
muscle cells and their proliferation in culture. We demonstrate that genetic
disruption of ZIP12 expression attenuates the development of pulmonary
hypertension in rats housed in a hypoxic atmosphere. This new and unexpected
insight into the fundamental role of a zinc transporter in mammalian pulmonary
vascular homeostasis suggests a new drug target for the pharmacological
management of pulmonary hypertension.

Activation of the μ-opioid receptor (μOR) is responsible for the efficacy of the 
most effective analgesics. To shed light on the structural basis for μOR
activation, here we report a 2.1 Å X-ray crystal structure of the murine μOR
bound to the morphinan agonist BU72 and a G protein mimetic camelid antibody
fragment. The BU72-stabilized changes in the μOR binding pocket are subtle and
differ from those observed for agonist-bound structures of the β2-adrenergic
receptor (β2AR) and the M2 muscarinic receptor. Comparison with active β2AR
reveals a common rearrangement in the packing of three conserved amino acids in
the core of the μOR, and molecular dynamics simulations illustrate how the
ligand-binding pocket is conformationally linked to this conserved triad.
Additionally, an extensive polar network between the ligand-binding pocket and
the cytoplasmic domains appears to play a similar role in signal propagation for 
all three G-protein-coupled receptors.

µ-Opioid receptors (µORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that are activated by a
structurally diverse spectrum of natural and synthetic agonists including
endogenous endorphin peptides, morphine and methadone. The recent structures of
the μOR in inactive and agonist-induced active states (Huang et al., ref. 2)
provide snapshots of the receptor at the beginning and end of a signalling event,
but little is known about the dynamic sequence of events that span these two
states. Here we use solution-state NMR to examine the process of μOR activation
using a purified receptor (mouse sequence) preparation in an amphiphile
membrane-like environment. We obtain spectra of the μOR in the absence of ligand,
and in the presence of the high-affinity agonist BU72 alone, or with BU72 and a G
protein mimetic nanobody. Our results show that conformational changes in
transmembrane segments 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6), which are required for the full
engagement of a G protein, are almost completely dependent on the presence of
both the agonist and the G protein mimetic nanobody, revealing a weak allosteric 
coupling between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling interface 
(TM5 and TM6), similar to that observed for the β2-adrenergic receptor.
Unexpectedly, in the presence of agonist alone, we find larger spectral changes
involving intracellular loop 1 and helix 8 compared to changes in TM5 and TM6.
These results suggest that one or both of these domains may play a role in the
initial interaction with the G protein, and that TM5 and TM6 are only engaged
later in the process of complex formation. The initial interactions between the G
protein and intracellular loop 1 and/or helix 8 may be involved in G-protein
coupling specificity, as has been suggested for other family A G-protein-coupled 
receptors.

The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) coordinate cellular adaptations to low
oxygen stress by regulating transcriptional programs in erythropoiesis,
angiogenesis and metabolism. These programs promote the growth and progression of
many tumours, making HIFs attractive anticancer targets. Transcriptionally active
HIFs consist of HIF-α and ARNT (also called HIF-1β) subunits. Here we describe
crystal structures for each of mouse HIF-2α-ARNT and HIF-1α-ARNT heterodimers in 
states that include bound small molecules and their hypoxia response element. A
highly integrated quaternary architecture is shared by HIF-2α-ARNT and
HIF-1α-ARNT, wherein ARNT spirals around the outside of each HIF-α subunit. Five 
distinct pockets are observed that permit small-molecule binding, including PAS
domain encapsulated sites and an interfacial cavity formed through subunit
heterodimerization. The DNA-reading head rotates, extends and cooperates with a
distal PAS domain to bind hypoxia response elements. HIF-α mutations linked to
human cancers map to sensitive sites that establish DNA binding and the stability
of PAS domains and pockets.

Enigmatic macrofossils of late Ediacaran age (580-541 million years ago) provide 
the oldest known record of diverse complex organisms on Earth, lying between the 
microbially dominated ecosystems of the Proterozoic and the Cambrian emergence of
the modern biosphere. Among the oldest and most enigmatic of these macrofossils
are the Rangeomorpha, a group characterized by modular, self-similar branching
and a sessile benthic habit. Localized occurrences of large in situ fossilized
rangeomorph populations allow fundamental aspects of their biology to be resolved
using spatial point process techniques. Here we use such techniques to identify
recurrent clustering patterns in the rangeomorph Fractofusus, revealing a complex
life history of multigenerational, stolon-like asexual reproduction, interspersed
with dispersal by waterborne propagules. Ecologically, such a habit would have
allowed both for the rapid colonization of a localized area and for transport to 
new, previously uncolonized areas. The capacity of Fractofusus to derive adult
morphology by two distinct reproductive modes documents the sophistication of its
underlying developmental biology.

Tissue morphogenesis is orchestrated by cell shape changes. Forces required to
power these changes are generated by non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) motor proteins 
pulling filamentous actin (F-actin). Actomyosin networks undergo cycles of
assembly and disassembly (pulses) to cause cell deformations alternating with
steps of stabilization to result in irreversible shape changes. Although this
ratchet-like behaviour operates in a variety of contexts, the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. Here we investigate the role of MyoII regulation
through the conserved Rho1-Rok pathway during Drosophila melanogaster germband
extension. This morphogenetic process is powered by cell intercalation, which
involves the shrinkage of junctions in the dorsal-ventral axis (vertical
junctions) followed by junction extension in the anterior-posterior axis. While
polarized flows of medial-apical MyoII pulses deform vertical junctions, MyoII
enrichment on these junctions (planar polarity) stabilizes them. We identify two 
critical properties of MyoII dynamics that underlie stability and pulsatility:
exchange kinetics governed by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles of the
MyoII regulatory light chain; and advection due to contraction of the motors on
F-actin networks. Spatial control over MyoII exchange kinetics establishes two
stable regimes of high and low dissociation rates, resulting in MyoII planar
polarity. Pulsatility emerges at intermediate dissociation rates, enabling
convergent advection of MyoII and its upstream regulators Rho1 GTP, Rok and MyoII
phosphatase. Notably, pulsatility is not an outcome of an upstream Rho1
pacemaker. Rather, it is a self-organized system that involves positive and
negative biomechanical feedback between MyoII advection and dissociation rates.

Activation of cellular stress response pathways to maintain metabolic homeostasis
is emerging as a critical growth and survival mechanism in many cancers. The
pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) requires high levels of
autophagy, a conserved self-degradative process. However, the regulatory circuits
that activate autophagy and reprogram PDA cell metabolism are unknown. Here we
show that autophagy induction in PDA occurs as part of a broader transcriptional 
program that coordinates activation of lysosome biogenesis and function, and
nutrient scavenging, mediated by the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors. In 
human PDA cells, the MiT/TFE proteins--MITF, TFE3 and TFEB--are decoupled from
regulatory mechanisms that control their cytoplasmic retention. Increased nuclear
import in turn drives the expression of a coherent network of genes that induce
high levels of lysosomal catabolic function essential for PDA growth. Unbiased
global metabolite profiling reveals that MiT/TFE-dependent autophagy-lysosome
activation is specifically required to maintain intracellular amino acid pools.
These results identify the MiT/TFE proteins as master regulators of metabolic
reprogramming in pancreatic cancer and demonstrate that transcriptional
activation of clearance pathways converging on the lysosome is a novel hallmark
of aggressive malignancy.

Diatoms are one of the most ecologically successful classes of photosynthetic
marine eukaryotes in the contemporary oceans. Over the past 30 million years,
they have helped to moderate Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, sequestering it via the biological carbon pump and ultimately burying
organic carbon in the lithosphere. The proportion of planetary primary production
by diatoms in the modern oceans is roughly equivalent to that of terrestrial
rainforests. In photosynthesis, the efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into
organic matter requires a tight control of the ATP/NADPH ratio which, in other
photosynthetic organisms, relies principally on a range of plastid-localized ATP 
generating processes. Here we show that diatoms regulate ATP/NADPH through
extensive energetic exchanges between plastids and mitochondria. This interaction
comprises the re-routing of reducing power generated in the plastid towards
mitochondria and the import of mitochondrial ATP into the plastid, and is
mandatory for optimized carbon fixation and growth. We propose that the process
may have contributed to the ecological success of diatoms in the ocean.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase PARKIN (encoded by PARK2) and the protein kinase PINK1
(encoded by PARK6) are mutated in autosomal-recessive juvenile Parkinsonism
(AR-JP) and work together in the disposal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy.
PINK1 is stabilized on the outside of depolarized mitochondria and phosphorylates
polyubiquitin as well as the PARKIN ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain. These
phosphorylation events lead to PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria, and activation
by an unknown allosteric mechanism. Here we present the crystal structure of
Pediculus humanus PARKIN in complex with Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin
(phosphoUb), revealing the molecular basis for PARKIN recruitment and activation.
The phosphoUb binding site on PARKIN comprises a conserved phosphate pocket and
harbours residues mutated in patients with AR-JP. PhosphoUb binding leads to
straightening of a helix in the RING1 domain, and the resulting conformational
changes release the Ubl domain from the PARKIN core; this activates PARKIN.
Moreover, phosphoUb-mediated Ubl release enhances Ubl phosphorylation by PINK1,
leading to conformational changes within the Ubl domain and stabilization of an
open, active conformation of PARKIN. We redefine the role of the Ubl domain not
only as an inhibitory but also as an activating element that is restrained in
inactive PARKIN and released by phosphoUb. Our work opens up new avenues to
identify small-molecule PARKIN activators.

Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful
predators with a rich behavioural repertoire. They have the largest nervous
systems among the invertebrates and present other striking morphological
innovations including camera-like eyes, prehensile arms, a highly derived early
embryogenesis and a remarkably sophisticated adaptive colouration system. To
investigate the molecular bases of cephalopod brain and body innovations, we
sequenced the genome and multiple transcriptomes of the California two-spot
octopus, Octopus bimaculoides. We found no evidence for hypothesized whole-genome
duplications in the octopus lineage. The core developmental and neuronal gene
repertoire of the octopus is broadly similar to that found across invertebrate
bilaterians, except for massive expansions in two gene families previously
thought to be uniquely enlarged in vertebrates: the protocadherins, which
regulate neuronal development, and the C2H2 superfamily of zinc-finger
transcription factors. Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and
protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously
described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular
functions. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which
showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the
suckers and the nervous system. Finally, we found evidence for large-scale
genomic rearrangements that are closely associated with transposable element
expansions. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene
families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive
content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological
innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems.

Flat-slab subduction occurs when the descending plate becomes horizontal at some 
depth before resuming its descent into the mantle. It is often proposed as a
mechanism for the uplifting of deep crustal rocks ('thick-skinned' deformation)
far from plate boundaries, and for causing unusual patterns of volcanism, as far 
back as the Proterozoic eon. For example, the formation of the expansive Rocky
Mountains and the subsequent voluminous volcanism across much of the western USA 
has been attributed to a broad region of flat-slab subduction beneath North
America that occurred during the Laramide orogeny (80-55 million years ago). Here
we study the largest modern flat slab, located in Peru, to better understand the 
processes controlling the formation and extent of flat slabs. We present new data
that indicate that the subducting Nazca Ridge is necessary for the development
and continued support of the horizontal plate at a depth of about 90 kilometres. 
By combining constraints from Rayleigh wave phase velocities with improved
earthquake locations, we find that the flat slab is shallowest along the ridge,
while to the northwest of the ridge, the slab is sagging, tearing, and
re-initiating normal subduction. On the basis of our observations, we propose a
conceptual model for the temporal evolution of the Peruvian flat slab in which
the flat slab forms because of the combined effects of trench retreat along the
Peruvian plate boundary, suction, and ridge subduction. We find that while the
ridge is necessary but not sufficient for the formation of the flat slab, its
removal is sufficient for the flat slab to fail. This provides new constraints on
our understanding of the processes controlling the beginning and end of the
Laramide orogeny and other putative episodes of flat-slab subduction.

Contemporary organic chemists employ a broad range of catalytic and
stoichiometric methods to construct molecules for applications in the material
sciences, and as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and sensors. The utility of a
synthetic method may be greatly reduced if it relies on a glove box to enable the
use of air- and moisture-sensitive reagents or catalysts. Furthermore, many
synthetic chemistry laboratories have numerous containers of partially used
reagents that have been spoiled by exposure to the ambient atmosphere. This is
exceptionally wasteful from both an environmental and a cost perspective. Here we
report an encapsulation method for stabilizing and storing air- and
moisture-sensitive compounds. We demonstrate this approach in three contexts, by 
describing single-use capsules that contain all of the reagents (catalysts,
ligands, and bases) necessary for the glove-box-free palladium-catalysed
carbon-fluorine, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. This 
strategy should reduce the number of error-prone, tedious and time-consuming
weighing procedures required for such syntheses and should be applicable to a
wide range of reagents, catalysts, and substrate combinations.

When a spatially uniform temperature change is imposed on a solid with more than 
one phase, or on a polycrystal of a single, non-cubic phase (showing anisotropic 
expansion-contraction), the resulting thermal strain is inhomogeneous
(non-affine). Thermal cycling induces internal stresses, leading to structural
and property changes that are usually deleterious. Glasses are the solids that
form on cooling a liquid if crystallization is avoided--they might be considered 
the ultimate, uniform solids, without the microstructural features and defects
associated with polycrystals. Here we explore the effects of cryogenic thermal
cycling on glasses, specifically metallic glasses. We show that, contrary to the 
null effect expected from uniformity, thermal cycling induces rejuvenation,
reaching less relaxed states of higher energy. We interpret these findings in the
context that the dynamics in liquids become heterogeneous on cooling towards the 
glass transition, and that there may be consequent heterogeneities in the
resulting glasses. For example, the vibrational dynamics of glassy silica at long
wavelengths are those of an elastic continuum, but at wavelengths less than
approximately three nanometres the vibrational dynamics are similar to those of a
polycrystal with anisotropic grains. Thermal cycling of metallic glasses is
easily applied, and gives improvements in compressive plasticity. The fact that
such effects can be achieved is attributed to intrinsic non-uniformity of the
glass structure, giving a non-uniform coefficient of thermal expansion. While
metallic glasses may be particularly suitable for thermal cycling, the non-affine
nature of strains in glasses in general deserves further study, whether they are 
induced by applied stresses or by temperature change.

Invariance under the charge, parity, time-reversal (CPT) transformation is one of
the fundamental symmetries of the standard model of particle physics. This CPT
invariance implies that the fundamental properties of antiparticles and their
matter-conjugates are identical, apart from signs. There is a deep link between
CPT invariance and Lorentz symmetry--that is, the laws of nature seem to be
invariant under the symmetry transformation of spacetime--although it is model
dependent. A number of high-precision CPT and Lorentz invariance tests--using a
co-magnetometer, a torsion pendulum and a maser, among others--have been
performed, but only a few direct high-precision CPT tests that compare the
fundamental properties of matter and antimatter are available. Here we report
high-precision cyclotron frequency comparisons of a single antiproton and a
negatively charged hydrogen ion (H(-)) carried out in a Penning trap system. From
13,000 frequency measurements we compare the charge-to-mass ratio for the
antiproton (q/m)p- to that for the proton (q/m)p and obtain (q/m)p-/(q/m)p − 1
=1(69) × 10(-12). The measurements were performed at cyclotron frequencies of
29.6 megahertz, so our result shows that the CPT theorem holds at the
atto-electronvolt scale. Our precision of 69 parts per trillion exceeds the
energy resolution of previous antiproton-to-proton mass comparisons as well as
the respective figure of merit of the standard model extension by a factor of
four. In addition, we give a limit on sidereal variations in the measured ratio
of <720 parts per trillion. By following the arguments of ref. 11, our result can
be interpreted as a stringent test of the weak equivalence principle of general
relativity using baryonic antimatter, and it sets a new limit on the
gravitational anomaly parameter of |α − 1| < 8.7 × 10(-7).

Protein aggregates are the hallmark of stressed and ageing cells, and
characterize several pathophysiological states. Healthy metazoan cells
effectively eliminate intracellular protein aggregates, indicating that efficient
disaggregation and/or degradation mechanisms exist. However, metazoans lack the
key heat-shock protein disaggregase HSP100 of non-metazoan HSP70-dependent
protein disaggregation systems, and the human HSP70 system alone, even with the
crucial HSP110 nucleotide exchange factor, has poor disaggregation activity in
vitro. This unresolved conundrum is central to protein quality control biology.
Here we show that synergic cooperation between complexed J-protein co-chaperones 
of classes A and B unleashes highly efficient protein disaggregation activity in 
human and nematode HSP70 systems. Metazoan mixed-class J-protein complexes are
transient, involve complementary charged regions conserved in the J-domains and
carboxy-terminal domains of each J-protein class, and are flexible with respect
to subunit composition. Complex formation allows J-proteins to initiate transient
higher order chaperone structures involving HSP70 and interacting nucleotide
exchange factors. A network of cooperative class A and B J-protein interactions
therefore provides the metazoan HSP70 machinery with powerful, flexible, and
finely regulatable disaggregase activity and a further level of regulation
crucial for cellular protein quality control.

The source of new hepatocytes in the uninjured liver has remained an open
question. By lineage tracing using the Wnt-responsive gene Axin2 in mice, we
identify a population of proliferating and self-renewing cells adjacent to the
central vein in the liver lobule. These pericentral cells express the early liver
progenitor marker Tbx3, are diploid, and thereby differ from mature hepatocytes, 
which are mostly polyploid. The descendants of pericentral cells differentiate
into Tbx3-negative, polyploid hepatocytes, and can replace all hepatocytes along 
the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal. Adjacent central vein endothelial
cells provide Wnt signals that maintain the pericentral cells, thereby
constituting the niche. Thus, we identify a cell population in the liver that
subserves homeostatic hepatocyte renewal, characterize its anatomical niche, and 
identify molecular signals that regulate its activity.

The specifics of how galaxies form from, and are fuelled by, gas from the
intergalactic medium remain uncertain. Hydrodynamic simulations suggest that
'cold accretion flows'--relatively cool (temperatures of the order of 10(4)
kelvin), unshocked gas streaming along filaments of the cosmic web into
dark-matter halos--are important. These flows are thought to deposit gas and
angular momentum into the circumgalactic medium, creating disk- or ring-like
structures that eventually coalesce into galaxies that form at filamentary
intersections. Recently, a large and luminous filament, consistent with such a
cold accretion flow, was discovered near the quasi-stellar object QSO UM287 at
redshift 2.279 using narrow-band imaging. Unfortunately, imaging is not
sufficient to constrain the physical characteristics of the filament, to
determine its kinematics, to explain how it is linked to nearby sources, or to
account for its unusual brightness, more than a factor of ten above what is
expected for a filament. Here we report a two-dimensional spectroscopic
investigation of the emitting structure. We find that the brightest emission
region is an extended rotating hydrogen disk with a velocity profile that is
characteristic of gas in a dark-matter halo with a mass of 10(13) solar masses.
This giant protogalactic disk appears to be connected to a quiescent filament
that may extend beyond the virial radius of the halo. The geometry is strongly
suggestive of a cold accretion flow.

DNA replication in eukaryotes is strictly regulated by several mechanisms. A
central step in this replication is the assembly of the heterohexameric
minichromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) helicase complex at replication origins
during G1 phase as an inactive double hexamer. Here, using cryo-electron
microscopy, we report a near-atomic structure of the MCM2-7 double hexamer
purified from yeast G1 chromatin. Our structure shows that two single hexamers,
arranged in a tilted and twisted fashion through interdigitated amino-terminal
domain interactions, form a kinked central channel. Four constricted rings
consisting of conserved interior β-hairpins from the two single hexamers create a
narrow passageway that tightly fits duplex DNA. This narrow passageway,
reinforced by the offset of the two single hexamers at the double hexamer
interface, is flanked by two pairs of gate-forming subunits, MCM2 and MCM5. These
unusual features of the twisted and tilted single hexamers suggest a concerted
mechanism for the melting of origin DNA that requires structural deformation of
the intervening DNA.

For centuries, practitioners of origami ('ori', fold; 'kami', paper) and kirigami
('kiru', cut) have fashioned sheets of paper into beautiful and complex
three-dimensional structures. Both techniques are scalable, and scientists and
engineers are adapting them to different two-dimensional starting materials to
create structures from the macro- to the microscale. Here we show that graphene
is well suited for kirigami, allowing us to build robust microscale structures
with tunable mechanical properties. The material parameter crucial for kirigami
is the Föppl-von Kármán number γ: an indication of the ratio between in-plane
stiffness and out-of-plane bending stiffness, with high numbers corresponding to 
membranes that more easily bend and crumple than they stretch and shear. To
determine γ, we measure the bending stiffness of graphene monolayers that are
10-100 micrometres in size and obtain a value that is thousands of times higher
than the predicted atomic-scale bending stiffness. Interferometric imaging
attributes this finding to ripples in the membrane that stiffen the graphene
sheets considerably, to the extent that γ is comparable to that of a standard
piece of paper. We may therefore apply ideas from kirigami to graphene sheets to 
build mechanical metamaterials such as stretchable electrodes, springs, and
hinges. These results establish graphene kirigami as a simple yet powerful and
customizable approach for fashioning one-atom-thick graphene sheets into
resilient and movable parts with microscale dimensions.

Mitochondria have a major role in energy production via oxidative
phosphorylation, which is dependent on the expression of critical genes encoded
by mitochondrial (mt)DNA. Mutations in mtDNA can cause fatal or severely
debilitating disorders with limited treatment options. Clinical manifestations
vary based on mutation type and heteroplasmy (that is, the relative levels of
mutant and wild-type mtDNA within each cell). Here we generated genetically
corrected pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from patients with mtDNA disease.
Multiple induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines were derived from patients
with common heteroplasmic mutations including 3243A>G, causing mitochondrial
encephalomyopathy and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and 8993T>G and 13513G>A,
implicated in Leigh syndrome. Isogenic MELAS and Leigh syndrome iPS cell lines
were generated containing exclusively wild-type or mutant mtDNA through
spontaneous segregation of heteroplasmic mtDNA in proliferating fibroblasts.
Furthermore, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) enabled replacement of mutant
mtDNA from homoplasmic 8993T>G fibroblasts to generate corrected Leigh-NT1 PSCs. 
Although Leigh-NT1 PSCs contained donor oocyte wild-type mtDNA (human haplotype
D4a) that differed from Leigh syndrome patient haplotype (F1a) at a total of 47
nucleotide sites, Leigh-NT1 cells displayed transcriptomic profiles similar to
those in embryo-derived PSCs carrying wild-type mtDNA, indicative of normal
nuclear-to-mitochondrial interactions. Moreover, genetically rescued patient PSCs
displayed normal metabolic function compared to impaired oxygen consumption and
ATP production observed in mutant cells. We conclude that both reprogramming
approaches offer complementary strategies for derivation of PSCs containing
exclusively wild-type mtDNA, through spontaneous segregation of heteroplasmic
mtDNA in individual iPS cell lines or mitochondrial replacement by SCNT in
homoplasmic mtDNA-based disease.

Cells sense their environment and adapt to it by fine-tuning their transcriptome.
Wired into this network of gene expression control are mechanisms to compensate
for gene dosage. The increasing use of reverse genetics in zebrafish, and other
model systems, has revealed profound differences between the phenotypes caused by
genetic mutations and those caused by gene knockdowns at many loci, an
observation previously reported in mouse and Arabidopsis. To identify the reasons
underlying the phenotypic differences between mutants and knockdowns, we
generated mutations in zebrafish egfl7, an endothelial extracellular matrix gene 
of therapeutic interest, as well as in vegfaa. Here we show that egfl7 mutants do
not show any obvious phenotypes while animals injected with egfl7 morpholino
(morphants) exhibit severe vascular defects. We further observe that egfl7
mutants are less sensitive than their wild-type siblings to Egfl7 knockdown,
arguing against residual protein function in the mutants or significant
off-target effects of the morpholinos when used at a moderate dose. Comparing
egfl7 mutant and morphant proteomes and transcriptomes, we identify a set of
proteins and genes that are upregulated in mutants but not in morphants. Among
them are extracellular matrix genes that can rescue egfl7 morphants, indicating
that they could be compensating for the loss of Egfl7 function in the
phenotypically wild-type egfl7 mutants. Moreover, egfl7 CRISPR interference,
which obstructs transcript elongation and causes severe vascular defects, does
not cause the upregulation of these genes. Similarly, vegfaa mutants but not
morphants show an upregulation of vegfab. Taken together, these data reveal the
activation of a compensatory network to buffer against deleterious mutations,
which was not observed after translational or transcriptional knockdown.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allosterically activate heterotrimeric G
proteins and trigger GDP release. Given that there are ∼800 human GPCRs and 16
different Gα genes, this raises the question of whether a universal allosteric
mechanism governs Gα activation. Here we show that different GPCRs interact with 
and activate Gα proteins through a highly conserved mechanism. Comparison of Gα
with the small G protein Ras reveals how the evolution of short segments that
undergo disorder-to-order transitions can decouple regions important for
allosteric activation from receptor binding specificity. This might explain how
the GPCR-Gα system diversified rapidly, while conserving the allosteric
activation mechanism.

Abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, caused in part by increased 
de novo lipogenesis, results in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and insulin
resistance. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), an important
transcriptional regulator of lipogenesis, is synthesized as an inactive precursor
that binds to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In response to insulin signalling, 
SREBP1 is transported from the ER to the Golgi in a COPII-dependent manner,
processed by proteases in the Golgi, and then shuttled to the nucleus to induce
lipogenic gene expression; however, the mechanisms underlying enhanced SREBP1
activity in insulin-resistant obesity and diabetes remain unclear. Here we show
in mice that CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) functions as a
mediator of mTOR signalling to modulate COPII-dependent SREBP1 processing. CRTC2 
competes with Sec23A, a subunit of the COPII complex, to interact with Sec31A,
another COPII subunit, thus disrupting SREBP1 transport. During feeding, mTOR
phosphorylates CRTC2 and attenuates its inhibitory effect on COPII-dependent
SREBP1 maturation. As hepatic overexpression of an mTOR-defective CRTC2 mutant in
obese mice improved the lipogenic program and insulin sensitivity, these results 
demonstrate how the transcriptional coactivator CRTC2 regulates mTOR-mediated
lipid homeostasis in the fed state and in obesity.

During fertilization, an egg and a sperm fuse to form a new embryo. Eggs develop 
from oocytes in a process called meiosis. Meiosis in human oocytes is highly
error-prone, and defective eggs are the leading cause of pregnancy loss and
several genetic disorders such as Down's syndrome. Which genes safeguard accurate
progression through meiosis is largely unclear. Here we develop high-content
phenotypic screening methods for the systematic identification of mammalian
meiotic genes. We targeted 774 genes by RNA interference within follicle-enclosed
mouse oocytes to block protein expression from an early stage of oocyte
development onwards. We then analysed the function of several genes
simultaneously by high-resolution imaging of chromosomes and microtubules in live
oocytes and scored each oocyte quantitatively for 50 phenotypes, generating a
comprehensive resource of meiotic gene function. The screen generated an
unprecedented annotated data set of meiotic progression in 2,241 mammalian
oocytes, which allowed us to analyse systematically which defects are linked to
abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis, identifying progression into
anaphase with misaligned chromosomes as well as defects in spindle organization
as risk factors. This study demonstrates how high-content screens can be
performed in oocytes, and allows systematic studies of meiosis in mammals.

Patterns of amino acid conservation have served as a tool for understanding
protein evolution. The same principles have also found broad application in human
genomics, driven by the need to interpret the pathogenic potential of variants in
patients. Here we performed a systematic comparative genomics analysis of human
disease-causing missense variants. We found that an appreciable fraction of
disease-causing alleles are fixed in the genomes of other species, suggesting a
role for genomic context. We developed a model of genetic interactions that
predicts most of these to be simple pairwise compensations. Functional testing of
this model on two known human disease genes revealed discrete cis amino acid
residues that, although benign on their own, could rescue the human mutations in 
vivo. This approach was also applied to ab initio gene discovery to support the
identification of a de novo disease driver in BTG2 that is subject to protective 
cis-modification in more than 50 species. Finally, on the basis of our data and
models, we developed a computational tool to predict candidate residues subject
to compensation. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of cis-genomic
context as a contributor to protein evolution; they provide an insight into the
complexity of allele effect on phenotype; and they are likely to assist methods
for predicting allele pathogenicity.

Neanderthals are thought to have disappeared in Europe approximately
39,000-41,000 years ago but they have contributed 1-3% of the DNA of present-day 
people in Eurasia. Here we analyse DNA from a 37,000-42,000-year-old modern human
from Peştera cu Oase, Romania. Although the specimen contains small amounts of
human DNA, we use an enrichment strategy to isolate sites that are informative
about its relationship to Neanderthals and present-day humans. We find that on
the order of 6-9% of the genome of the Oase individual is derived from
Neanderthals, more than any other modern human sequenced to date. Three
chromosomal segments of Neanderthal ancestry are over 50 centimorgans in size,
indicating that this individual had a Neanderthal ancestor as recently as four to
six generations back. However, the Oase individual does not share more alleles
with later Europeans than with East Asians, suggesting that the Oase population
did not contribute substantially to later humans in Europe.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is conserved in all eukaryotes and introduces the
first double bond into saturated fatty acyl-CoAs. Because the monounsaturated
products of SCD are key precursors of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters 
and triglycerides, SCD is pivotal in fatty acid metabolism. Humans have two SCD
homologues (SCD1 and SCD5), while mice have four (SCD1-SCD4). SCD1-deficient mice
do not become obese or diabetic when fed a high-fat diet because of improved
lipid metabolic profiles and insulin sensitivity. Thus, SCD1 is a pharmacological
target in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases. SCD1
is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, and
catalyses the formation of a cis-double bond between the ninth and tenth carbons 
of stearoyl- or palmitoyl-CoA. The reaction requires molecular oxygen, which is
activated by a di-iron centre, and cytochrome b5, which regenerates the di-iron
centre. To understand better the structural basis of these characteristics of SCD
function, here we crystallize and solve the structure of mouse SCD1 bound to
stearoyl-CoA at 2.6 Å resolution. The structure shows a novel fold comprising
four transmembrane helices capped by a cytosolic domain, and a plausible pathway 
for lateral substrate access and product egress. The acyl chain of the bound
stearoyl-CoA is enclosed in a tunnel buried in the cytosolic domain, and the
geometry of the tunnel and the conformation of the bound acyl chain provide a
structural basis for the regioselectivity and stereospecificity of the
desaturation reaction. The dimetal centre is coordinated by a unique spacial
arrangement of nine conserved histidine residues that implies a potentially novel
mechanism for oxygen activation. The structure also illustrates a possible route 
for electron transfer from cytochrome b5 to the di-iron centre.

Soils of the northern high latitudes store carbon over millennial timescales
(thousands of years) and contain approximately double the carbon stock of the
atmosphere. Warming and associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon
and result in mineralization and carbon dioxide (CO2) release. However, some of
this soil organic carbon may be eroded and transferred to rivers. If it escapes
degradation during river transport and is buried in marine sediments, then it can
contribute to a longer-term (more than ten thousand years), geological CO2 sink. 
Despite this recognition, the erosional flux and fate of particulate organic
carbon (POC) in large rivers at high latitudes remains poorly constrained. Here, 
we quantify the source of POC in the Mackenzie River, the main sediment supplier 
to the Arctic Ocean, and assess its flux and fate. We combine measurements of
radiocarbon, stable carbon isotopes and element ratios to correct for
rock-derived POC. Our samples reveal that the eroded biospheric POC has resided
in the basin for millennia, with a mean radiocarbon age of 5,800 ± 800 years,
much older than the POC in large tropical rivers. From the measured biospheric
POC content and variability in annual sediment yield, we calculate a biospheric
POC flux of 2.2(+1.3)(-0.9) teragrams of carbon per year from the Mackenzie
River, which is three times the CO2 drawdown by silicate weathering in this
basin. Offshore, we find evidence for efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial
over the Holocene period, suggesting that erosion of organic carbon-rich,
high-latitude soils may result in an important geological CO2 sink.

Only three elements are ferromagnetic at room temperature: the transition metals 
iron, cobalt and nickel. The Stoner criterion explains why iron is ferromagnetic 
but manganese, for example, is not, even though both elements have an unfilled 3d
shell and are adjacent in the periodic table: according to this criterion, the
product of the density of states and the exchange integral must be greater than
unity for spontaneous spin ordering to emerge. Here we demonstrate that it is
possible to alter the electronic states of non-ferromagnetic materials, such as
diamagnetic copper and paramagnetic manganese, to overcome the Stoner criterion
and make them ferromagnetic at room temperature. This effect is achieved via
interfaces between metallic thin films and C60 molecular layers. The emergent
ferromagnetic state exists over several layers of the metal before being quenched
at large sample thicknesses by the material's bulk properties. Although the
induced magnetization is easily measurable by magnetometry, low-energy muon spin 
spectroscopy provides insight into its distribution by studying the
depolarization process of low-energy muons implanted in the sample. This
technique indicates localized spin-ordered states at, and close to, the
metal-molecule interface. Density functional theory simulations suggest a
mechanism based on magnetic hardening of the metal atoms, owing to electron
transfer. This mechanism might allow for the exploitation of molecular coupling
to design magnetic metamaterials using abundant, non-toxic components such as
organic semiconductors. Charge transfer at molecular interfaces may thus be used 
to control spin polarization or magnetization, with consequences for the design
of devices for electronic, power or computing applications (see, for example,
refs 6 and 7).

The ribosome is a ribonucleoprotein machine responsible for protein synthesis. In
all kingdoms of life it is composed of two subunits, each built on its own
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) scaffold. The independent but coordinated functions of the
subunits, including their ability to associate at initiation, rotate during
elongation, and dissociate after protein release, are an established model of
protein synthesis. Furthermore, the bipartite nature of the ribosome is presumed 
to be essential for biogenesis, since dedicated assembly factors keep immature
ribosomal subunits apart and prevent them from translation initiation. Free
exchange of the subunits limits the development of specialized orthogonal genetic
systems that could be evolved for novel functions without interfering with native
translation. Here we show that ribosomes with tethered and thus inseparable
subunits (termed Ribo-T) are capable of successfully carrying out protein
synthesis. By engineering a hybrid rRNA composed of both small and large subunit 
rRNA sequences, we produced a functional ribosome in which the subunits are
covalently linked into a single entity by short RNA linkers. Notably, Ribo-T was 
not only functional in vitro, but was also able to support the growth of
Escherichia coli cells even in the absence of wild-type ribosomes. We used Ribo-T
to create the first fully orthogonal ribosome-messenger RNA system, and
demonstrate its evolvability by selecting otherwise dominantly lethal rRNA
mutations in the peptidyl transferase centre that facilitate the translation of a
problematic protein sequence. Ribo-T can be used for exploring poorly understood 
functions of the ribosome, enabling orthogonal genetic systems, and engineering
ribosomes with new functions.

Ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms are collectively responsible for
the aerobic oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate and have essential roles 
in the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. The physiology of nitrifiers has
been intensively studied, and urea and ammonia are the only recognized energy
sources that promote the aerobic growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and
archaea. Here we report the aerobic growth of a pure culture of the
ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeote Nitrososphaera gargensis using cyanate as the
sole source of energy and reductant; to our knowledge, the first organism known
to do so. Cyanate, a potentially important source of reduced nitrogen in aquatic 
and terrestrial ecosystems, is converted to ammonium and carbon dioxide in
Nitrososphaera gargensis by a cyanase enzyme that is induced upon addition of
this compound. Within the cyanase gene family, this cyanase is a member of a
distinct clade also containing cyanases of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the
genus Nitrospira. We demonstrate by co-culture experiments that these nitrite
oxidizers supply cyanase-lacking ammonia oxidizers with ammonium from cyanate,
which is fully nitrified by this microbial consortium through reciprocal feeding.
By screening a comprehensive set of more than 3,000 publically available
metagenomes from environmental samples, we reveal that cyanase-encoding genes
clustering with the cyanases of these nitrifiers are widespread in the
environment. Our results demonstrate an unexpected metabolic versatility of
nitrifying microorganisms, and suggest a previously unrecognized importance of
cyanate in cycling of nitrogen compounds in the environment.

The eukaryotic exosome is a conserved RNA-degrading complex that functions in RNA
surveillance, turnover and processing. How the same machinery can either
completely degrade or precisely trim RNA substrates has long remained
unexplained. Here we report the crystal structures of a yeast nuclear exosome
containing the 9-subunit core, the 3'-5' RNases Rrp44 and Rrp6, and the obligate 
Rrp6-binding partner Rrp47 in complex with different RNAs. The combined
structural and biochemical data of this 12-subunit complex reveal how a
single-stranded RNA can reach the Rrp44 or Rrp6 active sites directly or can bind
Rrp6 and be threaded via the central channel towards the distal RNase Rrp44. When
a bulky RNA is stalled at the entrance of the channel, Rrp6-Rrp47 swings open.
The results suggest how the same molecular machine can coordinate processive
degradation and partial trimming in an RNA-dependent manner by a concerted
swinging mechanism of the two RNase subunits.

Multidrug tolerance is largely responsible for chronic infections and caused by a
small population of dormant cells called persisters. Selection for survival in
the presence of antibiotics produced the first genetic link to multidrug
tolerance: a mutant in the Escherichia coli hipA locus. HipA encodes a
serine-protein kinase, the multidrug tolerance activity of which is neutralized
by binding to the transcriptional regulator HipB and hipBA promoter. The
physiological role of HipA in multidrug tolerance, however, has been unclear.
Here we show that wild-type HipA contributes to persister formation and that
high-persister hipA mutants cause multidrug tolerance in urinary tract
infections. Perplexingly, high-persister mutations map to the N-subdomain-1 of
HipA far from its active site. Structures of higher-order HipA-HipB-promoter
complexes reveal HipA forms dimers in these assemblies via N-subdomain-1
interactions that occlude their active sites. High-persistence mutations,
therefore, diminish HipA-HipA dimerization, thereby unleashing HipA to effect
multidrug tolerance. Thus, our studies reveal the mechanistic basis of heritable,
clinically relevant antibiotic tolerance.

bonds.

Amides are common functional groups that have been studied for more than a
century. They are the key building blocks of proteins and are present in a broad 
range of other natural and synthetic compounds. Amides are known to be poor
electrophiles, which is typically attributed to the resonance stability of the
amide bond. Although amides can readily be cleaved by enzymes such as proteases, 
it is difficult to selectively break the carbon-nitrogen bond of an amide using
synthetic chemistry. Here we demonstrate that amide carbon-nitrogen bonds can be 
activated and cleaved using nickel catalysts. We use this methodology to convert 
amides to esters, which is a challenging and underdeveloped transformation. The
reaction methodology proceeds under exceptionally mild reaction conditions, and
avoids the use of a large excess of an alcohol nucleophile. Density functional
theory calculations provide insight into the thermodynamics and catalytic cycle
of the amide-to-ester transformation. Our results provide a way to harness amide 
functional groups as synthetic building blocks and are expected to lead to the
further use of amides in the construction of carbon-heteroatom or carbon-carbon
bonds using non-precious-metal catalysis.

Cells require nucleotides to support DNA replication and repair damaged DNA. In
addition to de novo synthesis, cells recycle nucleotides from the DNA of dying
cells or from cellular material ingested through the diet. Salvaged nucleosides
come with the complication that they can contain epigenetic modifications.
Because epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation mainly relies on copying of the
modification pattern from parental strands, random incorporation of pre-modified 
bases during replication could have profound implications for epigenome fidelity 
and yield adverse cellular phenotypes. Although the salvage mechanism of
5-methyl-2'deoxycytidine (5mdC) has been investigated before, it remains unknown 
how cells deal with the recently identified oxidized forms of 5mdC:
5-hydroxymethyl-2'deoxycytidine (5hmdC), 5-formy-2'deoxycytidine (5fdC) and
5-carboxyl-2'deoxycytidine (5cadC). Here we show that enzymes of the nucleotide
salvage pathway display substrate selectivity, effectively protecting newly
synthesized DNA from the incorporation of epigenetically modified forms of
cytosine. Thus, cell lines and animals can tolerate high doses of these modified 
cytidines without any deleterious effects on physiology. Notably, by screening
cancer cell lines for growth defects after exposure to 5hmdC, we unexpectedly
identify a subset of cell lines in which 5hmdC or 5fdC administration leads to
cell lethality. Using genomic approaches, we show that the susceptible cell lines
overexpress cytidine deaminase (CDA). CDA converts 5hmdC and 5fdC into variants
of uridine that are incorporated into DNA, resulting in accumulation of DNA
damage, and ultimately, cell death. Our observations extend current knowledge of 
the nucleotide salvage pathway by revealing the metabolism of oxidized epigenetic
bases, and suggest a new therapeutic option for cancers, such as pancreatic
cancer, that have CDA overexpression and are resistant to treatment with other
cytidine analogues.

The prediction and synthesis of new crystal structures enable the targeted
preparation of materials with desired properties. Among porous solids, this has
been achieved for metal-organic frameworks, but not for the more widely
applicable zeolites, where new materials are usually discovered using exploratory
synthesis. Although millions of hypothetical zeolite structures have been
proposed, not enough is known about their synthesis mechanism to allow any given 
structure to be prepared. Here we present an approach that combines structure
solution with structure prediction, and inspires the targeted synthesis of new
super-complex zeolites. We used electron diffraction to identify a family of
related structures and to discover the structural 'coding' within them. This
allowed us to determine the complex, and previously unknown, structure of zeolite
ZSM-25 (ref. 8), which has the largest unit-cell volume of all known zeolites
(91,554 cubic ångströms) and demonstrates selective CO2 adsorption. By extending 
our method, we were able to predict other members of a family of increasingly
complex, but structurally related, zeolites and to synthesize two more-complex
zeolites in the family, PST-20 and PST-25, with much larger cell volumes (166,988
and 275,178 cubic ångströms, respectively) and similar selective adsorption
properties. Members of this family have the same symmetry, but an expanding unit 
cell, and are related by hitherto unrecognized structural principles; we call
these family members embedded isoreticular zeolite structures.

We have sequenced the genomes of 110 small cell lung cancers (SCLC), one of the
deadliest human cancers. In nearly all the tumours analysed we found bi-allelic
inactivation of TP53 and RB1, sometimes by complex genomic rearrangements. Two
tumours with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to
overexpression of cyclin D1 (encoded by the CCND1 gene), revealing an alternative
mechanism of Rb1 deregulation. Thus, loss of the tumour suppressors TP53 and RB1 
is obligatory in SCLC. We discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that 
create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73Δex2/3. In rare cases, SCLC tumours
exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for
individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family 
genes in 25% of human SCLC. Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling in a
pre-clinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumours and
extended the survival of the mutant mice. Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene
expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells. This first
comprehensive study of somatic genome alterations in SCLC uncovers several key
biological processes and identifies candidate therapeutic targets in this highly 
lethal form of cancer.

Deciphering how neural circuits are anatomically organized with regard to input
and output is instrumental in understanding how the brain processes information. 
For example, locus coeruleus noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) (LC-NE)
neurons receive input from and send output to broad regions of the brain and
spinal cord, and regulate diverse functions including arousal, attention, mood
and sensory gating. However, it is unclear how LC-NE neurons divide up their
brain-wide projection patterns and whether different LC-NE neurons receive
differential input. Here we developed a set of viral-genetic tools to
quantitatively analyse the input-output relationship of neural circuits, and
applied these tools to dissect the LC-NE circuit in mice. Rabies-virus-based
input mapping indicated that LC-NE neurons receive convergent synaptic input from
many regions previously identified as sending axons to the locus coeruleus, as
well as from newly identified presynaptic partners, including cerebellar Purkinje
cells. The 'tracing the relationship between input and output' method (or TRIO
method) enables trans-synaptic input tracing from specific subsets of neurons
based on their projection and cell type. We found that LC-NE neurons projecting
to diverse output regions receive mostly similar input. Projection-based viral
labelling revealed that LC-NE neurons projecting to one output region also
project to all brain regions we examined. Thus, the LC-NE circuit overall
integrates information from, and broadcasts to, many brain regions, consistent
with its primary role in regulating brain states. At the same time, we uncovered 
several levels of specificity in certain LC-NE sub-circuits. These tools for
mapping output architecture and input-output relationship are applicable to other
neuronal circuits and organisms. More broadly, our viral-genetic approaches
provide an efficient intersectional means to target neuronal populations based on
cell type and projection pattern.

The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set 
of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would
cause the spread of information to the whole network, or, if immunized, would
prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic. Localizing this optimal, that
is, minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most
important problems in network science. Despite the vast use of heuristic
strategies to identify influential spreaders, the problem remains unsolved. Here 
we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the
minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body 
system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking
matrix of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal
influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic
centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly connected
nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as
low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered
only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the
network. The present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of
universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a
continuous transition from a known phase.

Fusion and fission drive all vesicular transport. Although topologically
opposite, these reactions pass through the same hemi-fusion/fission intermediate,
characterized by a 'stalk' in which only the outer membrane monolayers of the two
compartments have merged to form a localized non-bilayer connection. Formation of
the hemi-fission intermediate requires energy input from proteins catalysing
membrane remodelling; however, the relationship between protein conformational
rearrangements and hemi-fusion/fission remains obscure. Here we analysed how the 
GTPase cycle of human dynamin 1, the prototypical membrane fission catalyst, is
directly coupled to membrane remodelling. We used intramolecular chemical
crosslinking to stabilize dynamin in its GDP·AlF4(-)-bound transition state. In
the absence of GTP this conformer produced stable hemi-fission, but failed to
progress to complete fission, even in the presence of GTP. Further analysis
revealed that the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) locked in its
membrane-inserted state facilitated hemi-fission. A second mode of dynamin
activity, fuelled by GTP hydrolysis, couples dynamin disassembly with cooperative
diminishing of the PHD wedging, thus destabilizing the hemi-fission intermediate 
to complete fission. Molecular simulations corroborate the bimodal character of
dynamin action and indicate radial and axial forces as dominant, although not
independent, drivers of hemi-fission and fission transformations, respectively.
Mirrored in the fusion reaction, the force bimodality might constitute a general 
paradigm for leakage-free membrane remodelling.

An epidemic of Ebola virus disease of unprecedented scale has been ongoing for
more than a year in West Africa. As of 29 April 2015, there have been 26,277
reported total cases (of which 14,895 have been laboratory confirmed) resulting
in 10,899 deaths. The source of the outbreak was traced to the prefecture of
Guéckédou in the forested region of southeastern Guinea. The virus later spread
to the capital, Conakry, and to the neighbouring countries of Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. In March 2014, when the first cases were
detected in Conakry, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal, deployed a mobile
laboratory in Donka hospital to provide diagnostic services to the greater
Conakry urban area and other regions of Guinea. Through this process we sampled
85 Ebola viruses (EBOV) from patients infected from July to November 2014, and
report their full genome sequences here. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the
sustained transmission of three distinct viral lineages co-circulating in Guinea,
including the urban setting of Conakry and its surroundings. One lineage is
unique to Guinea and closely related to the earliest sampled viruses of the
epidemic. A second lineage contains viruses probably reintroduced from
neighbouring Sierra Leone on multiple occasions, while a third lineage later
spread from Guinea to Mali. Each lineage is defined by multiple mutations,
including non-synonymous changes in the virion protein 35 (VP35), glycoprotein
(GP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins. The viral GP is characterized
by a glycosylation site modification and mutations in the mucin-like domain that 
could modify the outer shape of the virion. These data illustrate the ongoing
ability of EBOV to develop lineage-specific and potentially phenotypically
important variation.

West Africa is currently witnessing the most extensive Ebola virus (EBOV)
outbreak so far recorded. Until now, there have been 27,013 reported cases and
11,134 deaths. The origin of the virus is thought to have been a zoonotic
transmission from a bat to a two-year-old boy in December 2013 (ref. 2). From
this index case the virus was spread by human-to-human contact throughout Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, the origin of the particular virus in each
country and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on
epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of
obtaining patient information. Here we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the
current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. Deep sequencing of 179
patient samples processed by the European Mobile Laboratory, the first
diagnostics unit to be deployed to the epicentre of the outbreak in Guinea,
reveals an epidemiological and evolutionary history of the epidemic from March
2014 to January 2015. Analysis of EBOV genome evolution has also benefited from a
similar sequencing effort of patient samples from Sierra Leone. Our results
confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April
or early May. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around
June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014
indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be
used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the 
effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the 
evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak.

A novel Ebola virus (EBOV) first identified in March 2014 has infected more than 
25,000 people in West Africa, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths. Preliminary
analyses of genome sequences of 81 EBOV collected from March to June 2014 from
Guinea and Sierra Leone suggest that the 2014 EBOV originated from an independent
transmission event from its natural reservoir followed by sustained
human-to-human infections. It has been reported that the EBOV genome variation
might have an effect on the efficacy of sequence-based virus detection and
candidate therapeutics. However, only limited viral information has been
available since July 2014, when the outbreak entered a rapid growth phase. Here
we describe 175 full-length EBOV genome sequences from five severely stricken
districts in Sierra Leone from 28 September to 11 November 2014. We found that
the 2014 EBOV has become more phylogenetically and genetically diverse from July 
to November 2014, characterized by the emergence of multiple novel lineages. The 
substitution rate for the 2014 EBOV was estimated to be 1.23 × 10(-3)
substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density interval, 1.04 ×
10(-3) to 1.41 × 10(-3) substitutions per site per year), approximating to that
observed between previous EBOV outbreaks. The sharp increase in genetic diversity
of the 2014 EBOV warrants extensive EBOV surveillance in Sierra Leone, Guinea and
Liberia to better understand the viral evolution and transmission dynamics of the
ongoing outbreak. These data will facilitate the international efforts to develop
vaccines and therapeutics.

Intracellular energy distribution has attracted much interest and has been
proposed to occur in skeletal muscle via metabolite-facilitated diffusion;
however, genetic evidence suggests that facilitated diffusion is not critical for
normal function. We hypothesized that mitochondrial structure minimizes
metabolite diffusion distances in skeletal muscle. Here we demonstrate a
mitochondrial reticulum providing a conductive pathway for energy distribution,
in the form of the proton-motive force, throughout the mouse skeletal muscle
cell. Within this reticulum, we find proteins associated with mitochondrial
proton-motive force production preferentially in the cell periphery and proteins 
that use the proton-motive force for ATP production in the cell interior near
contractile and transport ATPases. Furthermore, we show a rapid, coordinated
depolarization of the membrane potential component of the proton-motive force
throughout the cell in response to spatially controlled uncoupling of the cell
interior. We propose that membrane potential conduction via the mitochondrial
reticulum is the dominant pathway for skeletal muscle energy distribution.

Earth's mightiest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC),
regulates the exchange of heat and carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere,
and influences vertical ocean structure, deep-water production and the global
distribution of nutrients and chemical tracers. The eastward-flowing ACC occupies
a unique circumglobal pathway in the Southern Ocean that was enabled by the
tectonic opening of key oceanic gateways during the break-up of Gondwana (for
example, by the opening of the Tasmanian Gateway, which connects the Indian and
Pacific oceans). Although the ACC is a key component of Earth's present and past 
climate system, the timing of the appearance of diagnostic features of the ACC
(for example, low zonal gradients in water-mass tracer fields) is poorly known
and represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of Earth history. Here we
show, using geophysically determined positions of continent-ocean boundaries,
that the deep Tasmanian Gateway opened 33.5 ± 1.5 million years ago (the errors
indicate uncertainty in the boundary positions). Following this opening,
sediments from Indian and Pacific cores recorded Pacific-type neodymium isotope
ratios, revealing deep westward flow equivalent to the present-day Antarctic
Slope Current. We observe onset of the ACC at around 30 million years ago, when
Southern Ocean neodymium isotopes record a permanent shift to modern
Indian-Atlantic ratios. Our reconstructions of ocean circulation show that
massive reorganization and homogenization of Southern Ocean water masses
coincided with migration of the northern margin of the Tasmanian Gateway into the
mid-latitude westerly wind band, which we reconstruct at 64° S, near to the
northern margin. Onset of the ACC about 30 million years ago coincided with major
changes in global ocean circulation and probably contributed to the lower
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels that appear after this time.

Dielectric materials, which store energy electrostatically, are ubiquitous in
advanced electronics and electric power systems. Compared to their ceramic
counterparts, polymer dielectrics have higher breakdown strengths and greater
reliability, are scalable, lightweight and can be shaped into intricate
configurations, and are therefore an ideal choice for many power electronics,
power conditioning, and pulsed power applications. However, polymer dielectrics
are limited to relatively low working temperatures, and thus fail to meet the
rising demand for electricity under the extreme conditions present in
applications such as hybrid and electric vehicles, aerospace power electronics,
and underground oil and gas exploration. Here we describe crosslinked polymer
nanocomposites that contain boron nitride nanosheets, the dielectric properties
of which are stable over a broad temperature and frequency range. The
nanocomposites have outstanding high-voltage capacitive energy storage
capabilities at record temperatures (a Weibull breakdown strength of 403
megavolts per metre and a discharged energy density of 1.8 joules per cubic
centimetre at 250 degrees Celsius). Their electrical conduction is several orders
of magnitude lower than that of existing polymers and their high operating
temperatures are attributed to greatly improved thermal conductivity, owing to
the presence of the boron nitride nanosheets, which improve heat dissipation
compared to pristine polymers (which are inherently susceptible to thermal
runaway). Moreover, the polymer nanocomposites are lightweight, photopatternable 
and mechanically flexible, and have been demonstrated to preserve excellent
dielectric and capacitive performance after intensive bending cycles. These
findings enable broader applications of organic materials in high-temperature
electronics and energy storage devices.

Acceleration and collision of particles has been a key strategy for exploring the
texture of matter. Strong light waves can control and recollide electronic
wavepackets, generating high-harmonic radiation that encodes the structure and
dynamics of atoms and molecules and lays the foundations of attosecond science.
The recent discovery of high-harmonic generation in bulk solids combines the idea
of ultrafast acceleration with complex condensed matter systems, and provides
hope for compact solid-state attosecond sources and electronics at optical
frequencies. Yet the underlying quantum motion has not so far been observable in 
real time. Here we study high-harmonic generation in a bulk solid directly in the
time domain, and reveal a new kind of strong-field excitation in the crystal.
Unlike established atomic sources, our solid emits high-harmonic radiation as a
sequence of subcycle bursts that coincide temporally with the field crests of one
polarity of the driving terahertz waveform. We show that these features are
characteristic of a non-perturbative quantum interference process that involves
electrons from multiple valence bands. These results identify key mechanisms for 
future solid-state attosecond sources and next-generation light-wave electronics.
The new quantum interference process justifies the hope for all-optical
band-structure reconstruction and lays the foundation for possible quantum logic 
operations at optical clock rates.

Aurorae are detected from all the magnetized planets in our Solar System,
including Earth. They are powered by magnetospheric current systems that lead to 
the precipitation of energetic electrons into the high-latitude regions of the
upper atmosphere. In the case of the gas-giant planets, these aurorae include
highly polarized radio emission at kilohertz and megahertz frequencies produced
by the precipitating electrons, as well as continuum and line emission in the
infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the spectrum, associated with
the collisional excitation and heating of the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Here
we report simultaneous radio and optical spectroscopic observations of an object 
at the end of the stellar main sequence, located right at the boundary between
stars and brown dwarfs, from which we have detected radio and optical auroral
emissions both powered by magnetospheric currents. Whereas the magnetic activity 
of stars like our Sun is powered by processes that occur in their lower
atmospheres, these aurorae are powered by processes originating much further out 
in the magnetosphere of the dwarf star that couple energy into the lower
atmosphere. The dissipated power is at least four orders of magnitude larger than
what is produced in the Jovian magnetosphere, revealing aurorae to be a
potentially ubiquitous signature of large-scale magnetospheres that can scale to 
luminosities far greater than those observed in our Solar System. These
magnetospheric current systems may also play a part in powering some of the
weather phenomena reported on brown dwarfs.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal primarily through G proteins or
arrestins. Arrestin binding to GPCRs blocks G protein interaction and redirects
signalling to numerous G-protein-independent pathways. Here we report the crystal
structure of a constitutively active form of human rhodopsin bound to a
pre-activated form of the mouse visual arrestin, determined by serial femtosecond
X-ray laser crystallography. Together with extensive biochemical and mutagenesis 
data, the structure reveals an overall architecture of the rhodopsin-arrestin
assembly in which rhodopsin uses distinct structural elements, including
transmembrane helix 7 and helix 8, to recruit arrestin. Correspondingly, arrestin
adopts the pre-activated conformation, with a ∼20° rotation between the amino and
carboxy domains, which opens up a cleft in arrestin to accommodate a short helix 
formed by the second intracellular loop of rhodopsin. This structure provides a
basis for understanding GPCR-mediated arrestin-biased signalling and demonstrates
the power of X-ray lasers for advancing the frontiers of structural biology.

The human lens is comprised largely of crystallin proteins assembled into a
highly ordered, interactive macro-structure essential for lens transparency and
refractive index. Any disruption of intra- or inter-protein interactions will
alter this delicate structure, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, with consequent
protein aggregation and cataract formation. Cataracts are the most common cause
of blindness worldwide, affecting tens of millions of people, and currently the
only treatment is surgical removal of cataractous lenses. The precise mechanisms 
by which lens proteins both prevent aggregation and maintain lens transparency
are largely unknown. Lanosterol is an amphipathic molecule enriched in the lens. 
It is synthesized by lanosterol synthase (LSS) in a key cyclization reaction of a
cholesterol synthesis pathway. Here we identify two distinct homozygous LSS
missense mutations (W581R and G588S) in two families with extensive congenital
cataracts. Both of these mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues
and impair key catalytic functions of LSS. Engineered expression of wild-type,
but not mutant, LSS prevents intracellular protein aggregation of various
cataract-causing mutant crystallins. Treatment by lanosterol, but not
cholesterol, significantly decreased preformed protein aggregates both in vitro
and in cell-transfection experiments. We further show that lanosterol treatment
could reduce cataract severity and increase transparency in dissected rabbit
cataractous lenses in vitro and cataract severity in vivo in dogs. Our study
identifies lanosterol as a key molecule in the prevention of lens protein
aggregation and points to a novel strategy for cataract prevention and treatment.

Bacteria share their ecological niches with other microbes. The bacterial type VI
secretion system is one of the key players in microbial competition, as well as
being an important virulence determinant during bacterial infections. It
assembles a nano-crossbow-like structure in the cytoplasm of the attacker cell
that propels an arrow made of a haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) tube and a 
valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) spike and punctures the prey's cell wall. 
The nano-crossbow is stably anchored to the cell envelope of the attacker by a
membrane core complex. Here we show that this complex is assembled by the
sequential addition of three type VI subunits (Tss)-TssJ, TssM and TssL-and
present a structure of the fully assembled complex at 11.6 Å resolution,
determined by negative-stain electron microscopy. With overall C5 symmetry, this 
1.7-megadalton complex comprises a large base in the cytoplasm. It extends in the
periplasm via ten arches to form a double-ring structure containing the
carboxy-terminal domain of TssM (TssMct) and TssJ that is anchored in the outer
membrane. The crystal structure of the TssMct-TssJ complex coupled to whole-cell 
accessibility studies suggest that large conformational changes induce transient 
pore formation in the outer membrane, allowing passage of the attacking Hcp
tube/VgrG spike.

Atmospheric methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon
dioxide, and is responsible for about 20% of the global warming effect since
pre-industrial times. Rice paddies are the largest anthropogenic methane source
and produce 7-17% of atmospheric methane. Warm waterlogged soil and exuded
nutrients from rice roots provide ideal conditions for methanogenesis in paddies 
with annual methane emissions of 25-100-million tonnes. This scenario will be
exacerbated by an expansion in rice cultivation needed to meet the escalating
demand for food in the coming decades. There is an urgent need to establish
sustainable technologies for increasing rice production while reducing methane
fluxes from rice paddies. However, ongoing efforts for methane mitigation in rice
paddies are mainly based on farming practices and measures that are difficult to 
implement. Despite proposed strategies to increase rice productivity and reduce
methane emissions, no high-starch low-methane-emission rice has been developed.
Here we show that the addition of a single transcription factor gene, barley
SUSIBA2 (refs 7, 8), conferred a shift of carbon flux to SUSIBA2 rice, favouring 
the allocation of photosynthates to aboveground biomass over allocation to roots.
The altered allocation resulted in an increased biomass and starch content in the
seeds and stems, and suppressed methanogenesis, possibly through a reduction in
root exudates. Three-year field trials in China demonstrated that the cultivation
of SUSIBA2 rice was associated with a significant reduction in methane emissions 
and a decrease in rhizospheric methanogen levels. SUSIBA2 rice offers a
sustainable means of providing increased starch content for food production while
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation. Approaches to increase
rice productivity and reduce methane emissions as seen in SUSIBA2 rice may be
particularly beneficial in a future climate with rising temperatures resulting in
increased methane emissions from paddies.

Cells that reside within a community can cooperate and also compete with each
other for resources. It remains unclear how these opposing interactions are
resolved at the population level. Here we investigate such an internal conflict
within a microbial (Bacillus subtilis) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm
periphery not only protect interior cells from external attack but also starve
them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between
protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic
co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth 
halts periodically, increasing nutrient availability for the sheltered interior
cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits the
community in the event of a chemical attack. These findings indicate that
oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating
competing metabolic demands in space and time, suggesting new strategies to
control biofilm growth.

Major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most frequently encountered forms of 
mental illness and a leading cause of disability worldwide, poses a major
challenge to genetic analysis. To date, no robustly replicated genetic loci have 
been identified, despite analysis of more than 9,000 cases. Here, using
low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 5,303 Chinese women with recurrent MDD
selected to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity, and 5,337 controls screened to
exclude MDD, we identified, and subsequently replicated in an independent sample,
two loci contributing to risk of MDD on chromosome 10: one near the SIRT1 gene
(P = 2.53 × 10(-10)), the other in an intron of the LHPP gene (P =
6.45 × 10(-12)). Analysis of 4,509 cases with a severe subtype of MDD,
melancholia, yielded an increased genetic signal at the SIRT1 locus. We attribute
our success to the recruitment of relatively homogeneous cases with severe
illness.

Volcanic eruptions contribute to climate variability, but quantifying these
contributions has been limited by inconsistencies in the timing of atmospheric
volcanic aerosol loading determined from ice cores and subsequent cooling from
climate proxies such as tree rings. Here we resolve these inconsistencies and
show that large eruptions in the tropics and high latitudes were primary drivers 
of interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere
during the past 2,500 years. Our results are based on new records of atmospheric 
aerosol loading developed from high-resolution, multi-parameter measurements from
an array of Greenland and Antarctic ice cores as well as distinctive age markers 
to constrain chronologies. Overall, cooling was proportional to the magnitude of 
volcanic forcing and persisted for up to ten years after some of the largest
eruptive episodes. Our revised timescale more firmly implicates volcanic
eruptions as catalysts in the major sixth-century pandemics, famines, and
socioeconomic disruptions in Eurasia and Mesoamerica while allowing
multi-millennium quantification of climate response to volcanic forcing.

Stem cells integrate inputs from multiple sources. Stem cell niches provide
signals that promote stem cell maintenance, while differentiated daughter cells
are known to provide feedback signals to regulate stem cell replication and
differentiation. Recently, stem cells have been shown to regulate themselves
using an autocrine mechanism. The existence of a 'stem cell niche' was first
postulated by Schofield in 1978 to define local environments necessary for the
maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells. Since then, an increasing body of work 
has focused on defining stem cell niches. Yet little is known about how
progenitor cell and differentiated cell numbers and proportions are maintained.
In the airway epithelium, basal cells function as stem/progenitor cells that can 
both self-renew and produce differentiated secretory cells and ciliated cells.
Secretory cells also act as transit-amplifying cells that eventually
differentiate into post-mitotic ciliated cells . Here we describe a mode of cell 
regulation in which adult mammalian stem/progenitor cells relay a forward signal 
to their own progeny. Surprisingly, this forward signal is shown to be necessary 
for daughter cell maintenance. Using a combination of cell ablation, lineage
tracing and signalling pathway modulation, we show that airway basal
stem/progenitor cells continuously supply a Notch ligand to their daughter
secretory cells. Without these forward signals, the secretory progenitor cell
pool fails to be maintained and secretory cells execute a terminal
differentiation program and convert into ciliated cells. Thus, a parent
stem/progenitor cell can serve as a functional daughter cell niche.

DNA methylation at selective cytosine residues (5-methylcytosine (5mC)) and their
removal by TET-mediated DNA demethylation are critical for setting up pluripotent
states in early embryonic development. TET enzymes successively convert 5mC to
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine
(5caC), with 5fC and 5caC subject to removal by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in 
conjunction with base excision repair. Early reports indicate that 5fC and 5caC
could be stably detected on enhancers, promoters and gene bodies, with distinct
effects on gene expression, but the mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we
determined the X-ray crystal structure of yeast elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol
II) in complex with a DNA template containing oxidized 5mCs, revealing specific
hydrogen bonds between the 5-carboxyl group of 5caC and the conserved epi-DNA
recognition loop in the polymerase. This causes a positional shift for incoming
nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (NTP), thus compromising nucleotide addition. To test 
the implication of this structural insight in vivo, we determined the global
effect of increased 5fC/5caC levels on transcription, finding that such DNA
modifications indeed retarded Pol II elongation on gene bodies. These results
demonstrate the functional impact of oxidized 5mCs on gene expression and suggest
a novel role for Pol II as a specific and direct epigenetic sensor during
transcription elongation.

The clinical course of autoimmune and infectious disease varies greatly, even
between individuals with the same condition. An understanding of the molecular
basis for this heterogeneity could lead to significant improvements in both
monitoring and treatment. During chronic infection the process of T-cell
exhaustion inhibits the immune response, facilitating viral persistence. Here we 
show that a transcriptional signature reflecting CD8 T-cell exhaustion is
associated with poor clearance of chronic viral infection, but conversely
predicts better prognosis in multiple autoimmune diseases. The development of CD8
T-cell exhaustion during chronic infection is driven both by persistence of
antigen and by a lack of accessory 'help' signals. In autoimmunity, we find that 
where evidence of CD4 T-cell co-stimulation is pronounced, that of CD8 T-cell
exhaustion is reduced. We can reproduce the exhaustion signature by modifying the
balance of persistent stimulation of T-cell antigen receptors and specific
CD2-induced co-stimulation provided to human CD8 T cells in vitro, suggesting
that each process plays a role in dictating outcome in autoimmune disease. The
'non-exhausted' T-cell state driven by CD2-induced co-stimulation is reduced by
signals through the exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptor PD-1, suggesting
that induction of exhaustion may be a therapeutic strategy in autoimmune and
inflammatory disease. Using expression of optimal surrogate markers of
co-stimulation/exhaustion signatures in independent data sets, we confirm an
association with good clinical outcome or response to therapy in infection
(hepatitis C virus) and vaccination (yellow fever, malaria, influenza), but poor 
outcome in autoimmune and inflammatory disease (type 1 diabetes, anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and dengue haemorrhagic fever). Thus, T-cell
exhaustion plays a central role in determining outcome in autoimmune disease and 
targeted manipulation of this process could lead to new therapeutic
opportunities.

The origin and early evolution of turtles have long been major contentious issues
in vertebrate zoology. This is due to conflicting character evidence from
molecules and morphology and a lack of transitional fossils from the critical
time interval. The ∼220-million-year-old stem-turtle Odontochelys from China has 
a partly formed shell and many turtle-like features in its postcranial skeleton. 
Unlike the 214-million-year-old Proganochelys from Germany and Thailand, it
retains marginal teeth and lacks a carapace. Odontochelys is separated by a large
temporal gap from the ∼260-million-year-old Eunotosaurus from South Africa, which
has been hypothesized as the earliest stem-turtle. Here we report a new reptile, 
Pappochelys, that is structurally and chronologically intermediate between
Eunotosaurus and Odontochelys and dates from the Middle Triassic period (∼240
million years ago). The three taxa share anteroposteriorly broad trunk ribs that 
are T-shaped in cross-section and bear sculpturing, elongate dorsal vertebrae,
and modified limb girdles. Pappochelys closely resembles Odontochelys in various 
features of the limb girdles. Unlike Odontochelys, it has a cuirass of robust
paired gastralia in place of a plastron. Pappochelys provides new evidence that
the plastron partly formed through serial fusion of gastralia. Its skull has
small upper and ventrally open lower temporal fenestrae, supporting the
hypothesis of diapsid affinities of turtles.

The mammalian hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory formation and
transiently retains information for about 3-4 weeks in adult mice and longer in
humans. Although neuroscientists widely believe that neural synapses are
elemental sites of information storage, there has been no direct evidence that
hippocampal synapses persist for time intervals commensurate with the duration of
hippocampal-dependent memory. Here we tested the prediction that the lifetimes of
hippocampal synapses match the longevity of hippocampal memory. By using
time-lapse two-photon microendoscopy in the CA1 hippocampal area of live mice, we
monitored the turnover dynamics of the pyramidal neurons' basal dendritic spines,
postsynaptic structures whose turnover dynamics are thought to reflect those of
excitatory synaptic connections. Strikingly, CA1 spine turnover dynamics differed
sharply from those seen previously in the neocortex. Mathematical modelling
revealed that the data best matched kinetic models with a single population of
spines with a mean lifetime of approximately 1-2 weeks. This implies ∼100%
turnover in ∼2-3 times this interval, a near full erasure of the synaptic
connectivity pattern. Although N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade
stabilizes spines in the neocortex, in CA1 it transiently increased the rate of
spine loss and thus lowered spine density. These results reveal that adult
neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have divergent patterns of spine
regulation and quantitatively support the idea that the transience of
hippocampal-dependent memory directly reflects the turnover dynamics of
hippocampal synapses.

Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplant is a widely used
treatment for life-threatening conditions such as leukaemia; however, the
molecular mechanisms regulating HSPC engraftment of the recipient niche remain
incompletely understood. Here we develop a competitive HSPC transplant method in 
adult zebrafish, using in vivo imaging as a non-invasive readout. We use this
system to conduct a chemical screen, and identify epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
(EETs) as a family of lipids that enhance HSPC engraftment. The
pro-haematopoietic effects of EETs were conserved in the developing zebrafish
embryo, where 11,12-EET promoted HSPC specification by activating a unique
activator protein 1 (AP-1) and runx1 transcription program autonomous to the
haemogenic endothelium. This effect required the activation of the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway, specifically PI(3)Kγ. In adult
HSPCs, 11,12-EET induced transcriptional programs, including AP-1 activation,
which modulate several cellular processes, such as migration, to promote
engraftment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the EET effects on enhancing HSPC
homing and engraftment are conserved in mammals. Our study establishes a new
method to explore the molecular mechanisms of HSPC engraftment, and discovers a
previously unrecognized, evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating multiple
haematopoietic generation and regeneration processes. EETs may have clinical
application in marrow or cord blood transplantation.

Sedimentary rocks deposited across the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition record 
extreme climate fluctuations, a potential rise in atmospheric oxygen or
re-organization of the seafloor redox landscape, and the initial diversification 
of animals. It is widely assumed that the inferred redox change facilitated the
observed trends in biodiversity. Establishing this palaeoenvironmental context,
however, requires that changes in marine redox structure be tracked by means of
geochemical proxies and translated into estimates of atmospheric oxygen.
Iron-based proxies are among the most effective tools for tracking the redox
chemistry of ancient oceans. These proxies are inherently local, but have global 
implications when analysed collectively and statistically. Here we analyse about 
4,700 iron-speciation measurements from shales 2,300 to 360 million years old.
Our statistical analyses suggest that subsurface water masses in mid-Proterozoic 
oceans were predominantly anoxic and ferruginous (depleted in dissolved oxygen
and iron-bearing), but with a tendency towards euxinia (sulfide-bearing) that is 
not observed in the Neoproterozoic era. Analyses further indicate that early
animals did not experience appreciable benthic sulfide stress. Finally, unlike
proxies based on redox-sensitive trace-metal abundances, iron geochemical data do
not show a statistically significant change in oxygen content through the
Ediacaran and Cambrian periods, sharply constraining the magnitude of the
end-Proterozoic oxygen increase. Indeed, this re-analysis of trace-metal data is 
consistent with oxygenation continuing well into the Palaeozoic era. Therefore,
if changing redox conditions facilitated animal diversification, it did so
through a limited rise in oxygen past critical functional and ecological
thresholds, as is seen in modern oxygen minimum zone benthic animal communities.

The carbon-nitrogen double bonds in imines are fundamentally important functional
groups in organic chemistry. This is largely due to the fact that imines act as
electrophiles towards carbon nucleophiles in reactions that form carbon-carbon
bonds, thereby serving as one of the most widely used precursors for the
formation of amines in both synthetic and biosynthetic settings. If the carbon
atom of the imine could be rendered electron-rich, the imine could react as a
nucleophile instead of as an electrophile. Such a reversal in the electronic
characteristics of the imine functionality would facilitate the development of
new chemical transformations that convert imines into amines via carbon-carbon
bond-forming reactions with carbon electrophiles, thereby creating new
opportunities for the efficient synthesis of amines. The development of
asymmetric umpolung reactions of imines (in which the imines act as nucleophiles)
remains uncharted territory, in spite of the far-reaching impact such reactions
would have in organic synthesis. Here we report the discovery and development of 
new chiral phase-transfer catalysts that promote the highly efficient asymmetric 
umpolung reactions of imines with the carbon electrophile enals. These catalysts 
mediate the deprotonation of imines and direct the 2-azaallyl anions thus formed 
to react with enals in a highly chemoselective, regioselective,
diastereoselective and enantioselective fashion. The reaction tolerates a broad
range of imines and enals, and can be carried out in high yield with as little as
0.01 mole per cent catalyst with a moisture- and air-tolerant operational
protocol. These umpolung reactions provide a conceptually new and practical
approach to chiral amino compounds.

It was suggested more than thirty years ago that Watson-Crick base pairing might 
be used for the rational design of nanometre-scale structures from nucleic acids.
Since then, and especially since the introduction of the origami technique, DNA
nanotechnology has enabled increasingly more complex structures. But although
general approaches for creating DNA origami polygonal meshes and design software 
are available, there are still important constraints arising from DNA geometry
and sense/antisense pairing, necessitating some manual adjustment during the
design process. Here we present a general method of folding arbitrary polygonal
digital meshes in DNA that readily produces structures that would be very
difficult to realize using previous approaches. The design process is highly
automated, using a routeing algorithm based on graph theory and a relaxation
simulation that traces scaffold strands through the target structures. Moreover, 
unlike conventional origami designs built from close-packed helices, our
structures have a more open conformation with one helix per edge and are
therefore stable under the ionic conditions usually used in biological assays.

Bacteria secrete peptides and proteins to communicate, to poison competitors, and
to manipulate host cells. Among the various protein-translocation machineries,
the peptidase-containing ATP-binding cassette transporters (PCATs) are
appealingly simple. Each PCAT contains two peptidase domains that cleave the
secretion signal from the substrate, two transmembrane domains that form a
translocation pathway, and two nucleotide-binding domains that hydrolyse ATP. In 
Gram-positive bacteria, PCATs function both as maturation proteases and exporters
for quorum-sensing or antimicrobial polypeptides. In Gram-negative bacteria,
PCATs interact with two other membrane proteins to form the type 1 secretion
system. Here we present crystal structures of PCAT1 from Clostridium thermocellum
in two different conformations. These structures, accompanied by biochemical
data, show that the translocation pathway is a large α-helical barrel sufficient 
to accommodate small folded proteins. ATP binding alternates access to the
transmembrane pathway and also regulates the protease activity, thereby coupling 
substrate processing to translocation.

Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have spatial firing fields that repeat
periodically in a hexagonal pattern. When animals move, activity is translated
between grid cells in accordance with the animal's displacement in the
environment. For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous
access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful
entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed 
is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated
population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the
local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These 'speed cells'
are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running
speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50-80 ms. Our
observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic
representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex.

Mutation rates vary within genomes, but the causes of this remain unclear. As
many prior inferences rely on methods that assume an absence of selection,
potentially leading to artefactual results, we call mutation events directly
using a parent-offspring sequencing strategy focusing on Arabidopsis and using
rice and honey bee for replication. Here we show that mutation rates are higher
in heterozygotes and in proximity to crossover events. A correlation between
recombination rate and intraspecific diversity is in part owing to a higher
mutation rate in domains of high recombination/diversity. Implicating diversity
per se as a cause, we find an ∼3.5-fold higher mutation rate in heterozygotes
than in homozygotes, with mutations occurring in closer proximity to heterozygous
sites than expected by chance. In a genome that is a patchwork of heterozygous
and homozygous domains, mutations occur disproportionately more often in the
heterozygous domains. If segregating mutations predispose to a higher local
mutation rate, clusters of genes dominantly under purifying selection (more
commonly homozygous) and under balancing selection (more commonly heterozygous), 
might have low and high mutation rates, respectively. Our results are consistent 
with this, there being a ten times higher mutation rate in pathogen resistance
genes, expected to be under positive or balancing selection. Consequently, we do 
not necessarily need to evoke extremely weak selection on the mutation rate to
explain why mutational hot and cold spots might correspond to regions under
positive/balancing and purifying selection, respectively.

Recent studies into the global causes of severe diarrhoea in young children have 
identified the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium as the second most important
diarrhoeal pathogen after rotavirus. Diarrhoeal disease is estimated to be
responsible for 10.5% of overall child mortality. Cryptosporidium is also an
opportunistic pathogen in the contexts of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-caused AIDS and organ transplantation. There is no vaccine and only a
single approved drug that provides no benefit for those in gravest danger:
malnourished children and immunocompromised patients. Cryptosporidiosis drug and 
vaccine development is limited by the poor tractability of the parasite, which
includes a lack of systems for continuous culture, facile animal models, and
molecular genetic tools. Here we describe an experimental framework to
genetically modify this important human pathogen. We established and optimized
transfection of C. parvum sporozoites in tissue culture. To isolate stable
transgenics we developed a mouse model that delivers sporozoites directly into
the intestine, a Cryptosporidium clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, and in vivo selection for aminoglycoside
resistance. We derived reporter parasites suitable for in vitro and in vivo drug 
screening, and we evaluated the basis of drug susceptibility by gene knockout. We
anticipate that the ability to genetically engineer this parasite will be
transformative for Cryptosporidium research. Genetic reporters will provide
quantitative correlates for disease, cure and protection, and the role of
parasite genes in these processes is now open to rigorous investigation.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), characterized by acute neurological dysfunction, is
one of the best known environmental risk factors for chronic traumatic
encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease, the defining pathologic features of which
include tauopathy made of phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau). However, tauopathy 
has not been detected in the early stages after TBI, and how TBI leads to
tauopathy is unknown. Here we find robust cis P-tau pathology after TBI in humans
and mice. After TBI in mice and stress in vitro, neurons acutely produce cis
P-tau, which disrupts axonal microtubule networks and mitochondrial transport,
spreads to other neurons, and leads to apoptosis. This process, which we term
'cistauosis', appears long before other tauopathy. Treating TBI mice with cis
antibody blocks cistauosis, prevents tauopathy development and spread, and
restores many TBI-related structural and functional sequelae. Thus, cis P-tau is 
a major early driver of disease after TBI and leads to tauopathy in chronic
traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease. The cis antibody may be further
developed to detect and treat TBI, and prevent progressive neurodegeneration
after injury.

Small-scale filament eruptions as the driver of X-ray jets in solar coronal
holes.

Solar X-ray jets are thought to be made by a burst of reconnection of closed
magnetic field at the base of a jet with ambient open field. In the accepted
version of the 'emerging-flux' model, such a reconnection occurs at a plasma
current sheet between the open field and the emerging closed field, and also
forms a localized X-ray brightening that is usually observed at the edge of the
jet's base. Here we report high-resolution X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet
observations of 20 randomly selected X-ray jets that form in coronal holes at the
Sun's poles. In each jet, contrary to the emerging-flux model, a miniature
version of the filament eruptions that initiate coronal mass ejections drives the
jet-producing reconnection. The X-ray bright point occurs by reconnection of the 
'legs' of the minifilament-carrying erupting closed field, analogous to the
formation of solar flares in larger-scale eruptions. Previous observations have
found that some jets are driven by base-field eruptions, but only one such study,
of only one jet, provisionally questioned the emerging-flux model. Our
observations support the view that solar filament eruptions are formed by a
fundamental explosive magnetic process that occurs on a vast range of scales,
from the biggest mass ejections and flare eruptions down to X-ray jets, and
perhaps even down to smaller jets that may power coronal heating. A similar
scenario has previously been suggested, but was inferred from different
observations and based on a different origin of the erupting minifilament.

Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian
disorders, and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces
evolutionary fitness. However, the effect of the more distant parental
relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood.
Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of
public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of
homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length.
Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human
populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide
sufficient power. Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related
quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find
statistically significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and
four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general
cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 × 10(-300), 2.1 × 10(-6), 2.5
× 10(-10) and 1.8 × 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity 
was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first
cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect
sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different
degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather
than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to
earlier reports in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an
influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density
lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional 
dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection, this 
study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been
positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for
late-onset complex diseases may not have been.

Although CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are widely used for genome editing, the range of
sequences that Cas9 can recognize is constrained by the need for a specific
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). As a result, it can often be difficult to
target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for
various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives
with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here
we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be
modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information,
bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These
altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites
in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and
their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by
GUIDE-seq analysis. In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9
variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better
discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGA PAMs
and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues,
Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9
(SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human
cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from
other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more
importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with 
altered and improved PAM specificities.

Recent studies have shown that in addition to the transcriptional circadian
clock, many organisms, including Arabidopsis, have a circadian redox rhythm
driven by the organism's metabolic activities. It has been hypothesized that the 
redox rhythm is linked to the circadian clock, but the mechanism and the
biological significance of this link have only begun to be investigated. Here we 
report that the master immune regulator NPR1 (non-expressor of
pathogenesis-related gene 1) of Arabidopsis is a sensor of the plant's redox
state and regulates transcription of core circadian clock genes even in the
absence of pathogen challenge. Surprisingly, acute perturbation in the redox
status triggered by the immune signal salicylic acid does not compromise the
circadian clock but rather leads to its reinforcement. Mathematical modelling and
subsequent experiments show that NPR1 reinforces the circadian clock without
changing the period by regulating both the morning and the evening clock genes.
This balanced network architecture helps plants gate their immune responses
towards the morning and minimize costs on growth at night. Our study demonstrates
how a sensitive redox rhythm interacts with a robust circadian clock to ensure
proper responsiveness to environmental stimuli without compromising fitness of
the organism.

Kennewick Man, referred to as the Ancient One by Native Americans, is a male
human skeleton discovered in Washington state (USA) in 1996 and initially
radiocarbon dated to 8,340-9,200 calibrated years before present (BP). His
population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal
controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that
Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant
Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and
requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial
decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA
did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were
permitted. Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more
closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he 
is to modern Native Americans. In order to resolve Kennewick Man's ancestry and
affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to ∼1× coverage and compared it to
worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that
Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population
worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are
available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely 
related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the
Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man.
We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genome-wide
comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to
specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons 
that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans over at least the
last eight millennia.

Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range
of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity.
Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular
phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from
identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and
principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method
for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for
transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a
programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from 
hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles
from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. 
Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors
and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with
either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify 
sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance
across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription
factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability.
The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates
chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to
three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility 
provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.

Heteroepitaxy-atomically aligned growth of a crystalline film atop a different
crystalline substrate-is the basis of electrically driven lasers, multijunction
solar cells, and blue-light-emitting diodes. Crystalline coherence is preserved
even when atomic identity is modulated, a fact that is the critical enabler of
quantum wells, wires, and dots. The interfacial quality achieved as a result of
heteroepitaxial growth allows new combinations of materials with complementary
properties, which enables the design and realization of functionalities that are 
not available in the single-phase constituents. Here we show that organohalide
perovskites and preformed colloidal quantum dots, combined in the solution phase,
produce epitaxially aligned 'dots-in-a-matrix' crystals. Using transmission
electron microscopy and electron diffraction, we reveal heterocrystals as large
as about 60 nanometres and containing at least 20 mutually aligned dots that
inherit the crystalline orientation of the perovskite matrix. The heterocrystals 
exhibit remarkable optoelectronic properties that are traceable to their
atom-scale crystalline coherence: photoelectrons and holes generated in the
larger-bandgap perovskites are transferred with 80% efficiency to become excitons
in the quantum dot nanocrystals, which exploit the excellent photocarrier
diffusion of perovskites to produce bright-light emission from infrared-bandgap
quantum-tuned materials. By combining the electrical transport properties of the 
perovskite matrix with the high radiative efficiency of the quantum dots, we
engineer a new platform to advance solution-processed infrared optoelectronics.

The diffuse interstellar bands are absorption lines seen towards reddened stars. 
None of the molecules responsible for these bands have been conclusively
identified. Two bands at 9,632 ångströms and 9,577 ångströms were reported in
1994, and were suggested to arise from C60(+) molecules (ref. 3), on the basis of
the proximity of these wavelengths to the absorption bands of C60(+) measured in 
a neon matrix. Confirmation of this assignment requires the gas-phase spectrum of
C60(+). Here we report laboratory spectroscopy of C60(+) in the gas phase, cooled
to 5.8 kelvin. The absorption spectrum has maxima at 9,632.7 ± 0.1 ångströms and 
9,577.5 ± 0.1 ångströms, and the full widths at half-maximum of these bands are
2.2 ± 0.2 ångströms and 2.5 ± 0.2 ångströms, respectively. We conclude that we
have positively identified the diffuse interstellar bands at 9,632 ångströms and 
9,577 ångströms as arising from C60(+) in the interstellar medium.

The continental crust is central to the biological and geological history of
Earth. However, crustal heterogeneity has prevented a thorough geochemical
comparison of its primary igneous building blocks-volcanic and plutonic rocks-and
the processes by which they differentiate to felsic compositions. Our analysis of
a comprehensive global data set of volcanic and plutonic whole-rock geochemistry 
shows that differentiation trends from primitive basaltic to felsic compositions 
for volcanic versus plutonic samples are generally indistinguishable in
subduction-zone settings, but are divergent in continental rifts. Offsets in
major- and trace-element differentiation patterns in rift settings suggest higher
water content in plutonic magmas and reduced eruptibility of hydrous silicate
magmas relative to dry rift volcanics. In both tectonic settings, our results
indicate that fractional crystallization, rather than crustal melting, is
predominantly responsible for the production of intermediate and felsic magmas,
emphasizing the role of mafic cumulates as a residue of crustal differentiation.

Surface polysaccharides are important for bacterial interactions with
multicellular organisms, and some are virulence factors in pathogens. In the
legume-rhizobium symbiosis, bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are essential for 
the development of infected root nodules. We have identified a gene in Lotus
japonicus, Epr3, encoding a receptor-like kinase that controls this infection. We
show that epr3 mutants are defective in perception of purified EPS, and that EPR3
binds EPS directly and distinguishes compatible and incompatible EPS in bacterial
competition studies. Expression of Epr3 in epidermal cells within the susceptible
root zone shows that the protein is involved in bacterial entry, while rhizobial 
and plant mutant studies suggest that Epr3 regulates bacterial passage through
the plant's epidermal cell layer. Finally, we show that Epr3 expression is
inducible and dependent on host perception of bacterial nodulation (Nod) factors.
Plant-bacterial compatibility and bacterial access to legume roots is thus
regulated by a two-stage mechanism involving sequential receptor-mediated
recognition of Nod factor and EPS signals.

Epistasis-the non-additive interactions between different genetic loci-constrains
evolutionary pathways, blocking some and permitting others. For biological
networks such as transcription circuits, the nature of these constraints and
their consequences are largely unknown. Here we describe the evolutionary
pathways of a transcription network that controls the response to mating
pheromone in yeast. A component of this network, the transcription regulator
Ste12, has evolved two different modes of binding to a set of its target genes.
In one group of species, Ste12 binds to specific DNA binding sites, while in
another lineage it occupies DNA indirectly, relying on a second transcription
regulator to recognize DNA. We show, through the construction of various possible
evolutionary intermediates, that evolution of the direct mode of DNA binding was 
not directly accessible to the ancestor. Instead, it was contingent on a
lineage-specific change to an overlapping transcription network with a different 
function, the specification of cell type. These results show that analysing and
predicting the evolution of cis-regulatory regions requires an understanding of
their positions in overlapping networks, as this placement constrains the
available evolutionary pathways.

Progesterone receptor (PR) expression is used as a biomarker of oestrogen
receptor-α (ERα) function and breast cancer prognosis. Here we show that PR is
not merely an ERα-induced gene target, but is also an ERα-associated protein that
modulates its behaviour. In the presence of agonist ligands, PR associates with
ERα to direct ERα chromatin binding events within breast cancer cells, resulting 
in a unique gene expression programme that is associated with good clinical
outcome. Progesterone inhibited oestrogen-mediated growth of ERα(+) cell line
xenografts and primary ERα(+) breast tumour explants, and had increased
anti-proliferative effects when coupled with an ERα antagonist. Copy number loss 
of PGR, the gene coding for PR, is a common feature in ERα(+) breast cancers,
explaining lower PR levels in a subset of cases. Our findings indicate that PR
functions as a molecular rheostat to control ERα chromatin binding and
transcriptional activity, which has important implications for prognosis and
therapeutic interventions.

Stem cell niches provide resident stem cells with signals that specify their
identity. Niche signals act over a short range such that only stem cells but not 
their differentiating progeny receive the self-renewing signals. However, the
cellular mechanisms that limit niche signalling to stem cells remain poorly
understood. Here we show that the Drosophila male germline stem cells form
previously unrecognized structures, microtubule-based nanotubes, which extend
into the hub, a major niche component. Microtubule-based nanotubes are observed
specifically within germline stem cell populations, and require intraflagellar
transport proteins for their formation. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
receptor Tkv localizes to microtubule-based nanotubes. Perturbation of
microtubule-based nanotubes compromises activation of Dpp signalling within
germline stem cells, leading to germline stem cell loss. Moreover, Dpp ligand and
Tkv receptor interaction is necessary and sufficient for microtubule-based
nanotube formation. We propose that microtubule-based nanotubes provide a novel
mechanism for selective receptor-ligand interaction, contributing to the
short-range nature of niche-stem-cell signalling.

Horizontal branch stars belong to an advanced stage in the evolution of the
oldest stellar galactic population, occurring either as field halo stars or
grouped in globular clusters. The discovery of multiple populations in clusters
that were previously believed to have single populations gave rise to the
currently accepted theory that the hottest horizontal branch members (the 'blue
hook' stars, which had late helium-core flash ignition, followed by deep mixing) 
are the progeny of a helium-rich 'second generation' of stars. It is not known
why such a supposedly rare event (a late flash followed by mixing) is so common
that the blue hook of ω Centauri contains approximately 30 per cent of the
horizontal branch stars in the cluster, or why the blue hook luminosity range in 
this massive cluster cannot be reproduced by models. Here we report that the
presence of helium core masses up to about 0.04 solar masses larger than the core
mass resulting from evolution is required to solve the luminosity range problem. 
We model this by taking into account the dispersion in rotation rates achieved by
the progenitors, whose pre-main-sequence accretion disk suffered an early
disruption in the dense environment of the cluster's central regions, where
second-generation stars form. Rotation may also account for frequent
late-flash-mixing events in massive globular clusters.

Retroviral integration is catalysed by a tetramer of integrase (IN) assembled on 
viral DNA ends in a stable complex, known as the intasome. How the intasome
interfaces with chromosomal DNA, which exists in the form of nucleosomal arrays, 
is currently unknown. Here we show that the prototype foamy virus (PFV) intasome 
is proficient at stable capture of nucleosomes as targets for integration.
Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals a multivalent
intasome-nucleosome interface involving both gyres of nucleosomal DNA and one
H2A-H2B heterodimer. While the histone octamer remains intact, the DNA is lifted 
from the surface of the H2A-H2B heterodimer to allow integration at strongly
preferred superhelix location ±3.5 positions. Amino acid substitutions disrupting
these contacts impinge on the ability of the intasome to engage nucleosomes in
vitro and redistribute viral integration sites on the genomic scale. Our findings
elucidate the molecular basis for nucleosome capture by the viral DNA
recombination machinery and the underlying nucleosome plasticity that allows
integration.

Gram-negative bacteria inhabit a broad range of ecological niches. For
Escherichia coli, this includes river water as well as humans and animals, where 
it can be both a commensal and a pathogen. Intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure
that bacteria have the right complement of β-barrel outer membrane proteins
(OMPs) to enable adaptation to a particular habitat. Yet no mechanism is known
for replacing OMPs in the outer membrane, an issue that is further confounded by 
the lack of an energy source and the high stability and abundance of OMPs. Here
we uncover the process underpinning OMP turnover in E. coli and show it to be
passive and binary in nature, in which old OMPs are displaced to the poles of
growing cells as new OMPs take their place. Using fluorescent colicins as
OMP-specific probes, in combination with ensemble and single-molecule
fluorescence microscopy in vivo and in vitro, as well as molecular dynamics
simulations, we established the mechanism for binary OMP partitioning. OMPs
clustered to form ∼0.5-μm diameter islands, where their diffusion is restricted
by promiscuous interactions with other OMPs. OMP islands were distributed
throughout the cell and contained the Bam complex, which catalyses the insertion 
of OMPs in the outer membrane. However, OMP biogenesis occurred as a gradient
that was highest at mid-cell but largely absent at cell poles. The cumulative
effect is to push old OMP islands towards the poles of growing cells, leading to 
a binary distribution when cells divide. Hence, the outer membrane of a
Gram-negative bacterium is a spatially and temporally organized structure, and
this organization lies at the heart of how OMPs are turned over in the membrane.

Lipid mediators influence immunity in myriad ways. For example, circulating
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a key regulator of lymphocyte egress. Although
the majority of plasma S1P is bound to apolipoprotein M (ApoM) in the
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle, the immunological functions of the
ApoM-S1P complex are unknown. Here we show that ApoM-S1P is dispensable for
lymphocyte trafficking yet restrains lymphopoiesis by activating the S1P1
receptor on bone marrow lymphocyte progenitors. Mice that lacked ApoM (Apom(-/-))
had increased proliferation of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) cKit(+) haematopoietic progenitor 
cells (LSKs) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) in bone marrow.
Pharmacological activation or genetic overexpression of S1P1 suppressed LSK and
CLP cell proliferation in vivo. ApoM was stably associated with bone marrow CLPs,
which showed active S1P1 signalling in vivo. Moreover, ApoM-bound S1P, but not
albumin-bound S1P, inhibited lymphopoiesis in vitro. Upon immune stimulation,
Apom(-/-) mice developed more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
characterized by increased lymphocytes in the central nervous system and
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the ApoM-S1P-S1P1 signalling axis
restrains the lymphocyte compartment and, subsequently, adaptive immune
responses. Unique biological functions imparted by specific S1P chaperones could 
be exploited for novel therapeutic opportunities.

During bacterial growth, a cell approximately doubles in size before division,
after which it splits into two daughter cells. This process is subjected to the
inherent perturbations of cellular noise and thus requires regulation for
cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying the control and dynamics of cell
size remain poorly understood owing to the difficulty in sizing individual
bacteria over long periods of time in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure
and analyse long-term, single-cell growth and division across different
Escherichia coli strains and growth conditions. We show that a subset of cells in
a population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that
stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals that a
simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear map-explains the origins of
these cell-size oscillations across all strains. This noisy linear map implements
a negative feedback on cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends
to divide earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later.
Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental data, we
demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient oscillations, not just
in cell size, but also in constitutive gene expression. Our work provides new
insights into the dynamics of bacterial cell-size regulation with implications
for the physiological processes involved.

One of the characteristics of the central nervous system is the lack of a
classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the central
nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the
meningeal compartment, the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune
cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood. In searching for 
T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic 
vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular
hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune
cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph 
nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to
date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic
vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous
system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in
neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and
neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.

Prostate cancer resistance to castration occurs because tumours acquire the
metabolic capability of converting precursor steroids to 5α-dihydrotestosterone
(DHT), promoting signalling by the androgen receptor and the development of
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Essential for resistance, DHT synthesis
from adrenal precursor steroids or possibly from de novo synthesis from
cholesterol commonly requires enzymatic reactions by 3β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (3βHSD), steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) and 17β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (17βHSD) isoenzymes. Abiraterone, a steroidal
17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) inhibitor, blocks this synthetic process
and prolongs survival. We hypothesized that abiraterone is converted by an enzyme
to the more active Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A), which blocks multiple steroidogenic
enzymes and antagonizes the androgen receptor, providing an additional
explanation for abiraterone's clinical activity. Here we show that abiraterone is
converted to D4A in mice and patients with prostate cancer. D4A inhibits CYP17A1,
3βHSD and SRD5A, which are required for DHT synthesis. Furthermore, competitive
androgen receptor antagonism by D4A is comparable to the potent antagonist
enzalutamide. D4A also has more potent anti-tumour activity against xenograft
tumours than abiraterone. Our findings suggest an additional
explanation-conversion to a more active agent-for abiraterone's survival
extension. We propose that direct treatment with D4A would be more clinically
effective than abiraterone treatment.

Missense mutations in p53 generate aberrant proteins with abrogated tumour
suppressor functions that can also acquire oncogenic gain-of-function activities 
that promote malignant progression, invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance.
Mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins undergo massive constitutive stabilization
specifically in tumours, which is the key requisite for the acquisition of
gain-of-functions activities. Although currently 11 million patients worldwide
live with tumours expressing highly stabilized mutp53, it is unknown whether
mutp53 is a therapeutic target in vivo. Here we use a novel mutp53 mouse model
expressing an inactivatable R248Q hotspot mutation (floxQ) to show that tumours
depend on sustained mutp53 expression. Upon tamoxifen-induced mutp53 ablation,
allotransplanted and autochthonous tumours curb their growth, thus extending
animal survival by 37%, and advanced tumours undergo apoptosis and tumour
regression or stagnation. The HSP90/HDAC6 chaperone machinery, which is
significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal tissues, is a major
determinant of mutp53 stabilization. We show that long-term HSP90 inhibition
significantly extends the survival of mutp53 Q/- (R248Q allele) and H/H (R172H
allele) mice by 59% and 48%, respectively, but not their corresponding p53(-/-)
littermates. This mutp53-dependent drug effect occurs in H/H mice treated with
17DMAG+SAHA and in H/H and Q/- mice treated with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor
ganetespib. Notably, drug activity correlates with induction of mutp53
degradation, tumour apoptosis and prevention of T-cell lymphomagenesis. These
proof-of-principle data identify mutp53 as an actionable cancer-specific drug
target.

Hydrothermal venting along mid-ocean ridges exerts an important control on the
chemical composition of sea water by serving as a major source or sink for a
number of trace elements in the ocean. Of these, iron has received considerable
attention because of its role as an essential and often limiting nutrient for
primary production in regions of the ocean that are of critical importance for
the global carbon cycle. It has been thought that most of the dissolved iron
discharged by hydrothermal vents is lost from solution close to ridge-axis
sources and is thus of limited importance for ocean biogeochemistry. This
long-standing view is challenged by recent studies which suggest that
stabilization of hydrothermal dissolved iron may facilitate its long-range
oceanic transport. Such transport has been subsequently inferred from spatially
limited oceanographic observations. Here we report data from the US GEOTRACES
Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) that demonstrate lateral transport of
hydrothermal dissolved iron, manganese, and aluminium from the southern East
Pacific Rise (SEPR) several thousand kilometres westward across the South Pacific
Ocean. Dissolved iron exhibits nearly conservative (that is, no loss from
solution during transport and mixing) behaviour in this hydrothermal plume,
implying a greater longevity in the deep ocean than previously assumed. Based on 
our observations, we estimate a global hydrothermal dissolved iron input of three
to four gigamoles per year to the ocean interior, which is more than fourfold
higher than previous estimates. Complementary simulations with a global-scale
ocean biogeochemical model suggest that the observed transport of hydrothermal
dissolved iron requires some means of physicochemical stabilization and indicate 
that hydrothermally derived iron sustains a large fraction of Southern Ocean
export production.

Efficient transport of excitation energy over long distances is a key process in 
light-harvesting systems, as well as in molecular electronics. However, in
synthetic disordered organic materials, the exciton diffusion length is typically
only around 10 nanometres (refs 4, 5), or about 50 nanometres in exceptional
cases, a distance that is largely determined by the probability laws of
incoherent exciton hopping. Only for highly ordered organic systems has the
transport of excitation energy over macroscopic distances been reported--for
example, for triplet excitons in anthracene single crystals at room temperature, 
as well as along single polydiacetylene chains embedded in their monomer
crystalline matrix at cryogenic temperatures (at 10 kelvin, or -263 degrees
Celsius). For supramolecular nanostructures, uniaxial long-range transport has
not been demonstrated at room temperature. Here we show that individual
self-assembled nanofibres with molecular-scale diameter efficiently transport
singlet excitons at ambient conditions over more than four micrometres, a
distance that is limited only by the fibre length. Our data suggest that this
remarkable long-range transport is predominantly coherent. Such coherent
long-range transport is achieved by one-dimensional self-assembly of
supramolecular building blocks, based on carbonyl-bridged triarylamines, into
well defined H-type aggregates (in which individual monomers are aligned
cofacially) with substantial electronic interactions. These findings may
facilitate the development of organic nanophotonic devices and quantum
information technology.

A new class of ultra-long-duration (more than 10,000 seconds) γ-ray bursts has
recently been suggested. They may originate in the explosion of stars with much
larger radii than those producing normal long-duration γ-ray bursts or in the
tidal disruption of a star. No clear supernova has yet been associated with an
ultra-long-duration γ-ray burst. Here we report that a supernova (SN 2011kl) was 
associated with the ultra-long-duration γ-ray burst GRB 111209A, at a redshift z 
of 0.677. This supernova is more than three times more luminous than type Ic
supernovae associated with long-duration γ-ray bursts, and its spectrum is
distinctly different. The slope of the continuum resembles those of
super-luminous supernovae, but extends further down into the rest-frame
ultraviolet implying a low metal content. The light curve evolves much more
rapidly than those of super-luminous supernovae. This combination of high
luminosity and low metal-line opacity cannot be reconciled with typical type Ic
supernovae, but can be reproduced by a model where extra energy is injected by a 
strongly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar), which has also been proposed as
the explanation for super-luminous supernovae.

The formation, evolution and death of massive stars release large quantities of
energy and momentum into the gas surrounding the sites of star formation. This
process, generically termed 'feedback', inhibits further star formation either by
removing gas from the galaxy, or by heating it to temperatures that are too high 
to form new stars. Observations reveal feedback in the form of galactic-scale
outflows of gas in galaxies with high rates of star formation, especially in the 
early Universe. Feedback in faint, low-mass galaxies probably facilitated the
escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies when the Universe was about 500
million years old, so that the hydrogen between galaxies changed from neutral to 
ionized-the last major phase transition in the Universe.

Lenalidomide is a highly effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
with deletion of chromosome 5q (del(5q)). Here, we demonstrate that lenalidomide 
induces the ubiquitination of casein kinase 1A1 (CK1α) by the E3 ubiquitin ligase
CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (known as CRL4(CRBN)), resulting in CK1α degradation. CK1α is
encoded by a gene within the common deleted region for del(5q) MDS and
haploinsufficient expression sensitizes cells to lenalidomide therapy, providing 
a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic window of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS. We
found that mouse cells are resistant to lenalidomide but that changing a single
amino acid in mouse Crbn to the corresponding human residue enables
lenalidomide-dependent degradation of CK1α. We further demonstrate that minor
side chain modifications in thalidomide and a novel analogue, CC-122, can
modulate the spectrum of substrates targeted by CRL4(CRBN). These findings have
implications for the clinical activity of lenalidomide and related compounds, and
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of novel modulators of E3 ubiquitin
ligases.

Multicellularity is often considered a prerequisite for morphological complexity,
as seen in the camera-type eyes found in several groups of animals. A notable
exception exists in single-celled eukaryotes called dinoflagellates, some of
which have an eye-like 'ocelloid' consisting of subcellular analogues to a
cornea, lens, iris, and retina. These planktonic cells are uncultivated and
rarely encountered in environmental samples, obscuring the function and
evolutionary origin of the ocelloid. Here we show, using a combination of
electron microscopy, tomography, isolated-organelle genomics, and single-cell
genomics, that ocelloids are built from pre-existing organelles, including a
cornea-like layer made of mitochondria and a retinal body made of anastomosing
plastids. We find that the retinal body forms the central core of a network of
peridinin-type plastids, which in dinoflagellates and their relatives originated 
through an ancient endosymbiosis with a red alga. As such, the ocelloid is a
chimaeric structure, incorporating organelles with different endosymbiotic
histories. The anatomical complexity of single-celled organisms may be limited by
the components available for differentiation, but the ocelloid shows that
pre-existing organelles can be assembled into a structure so complex that it was 
initially mistaken for a multicellular eye. Although mitochondria and plastids
are acknowledged chiefly for their metabolic roles, they can also be building
blocks for greater structural complexity.

Over 40 years ago it was suggested that electron loss in the region of the
radiation belts that overlaps with the region of high plasma density called the
plasmasphere, within four to five Earth radii, arises largely from interaction
with an electromagnetic plasma wave called plasmaspheric hiss. This interaction
strongly influences the evolution of the radiation belts during a geomagnetic
storm, and over the course of many hours to days helps to return the
radiation-belt structure to its 'quiet' pre-storm configuration. Observations
have shown that the long-term electron-loss rate is consistent with this theory
but the temporal and spatial dynamics of the loss process remain to be directly
verified. Here we report simultaneous measurements of structured radiation-belt
electron losses and the hiss phenomenon that causes the losses. Losses were
observed in the form of bremsstrahlung X-rays generated by hiss-scattered
electrons colliding with the Earth's atmosphere after removal from the radiation 
belts. Our results show that changes of up to an order of magnitude in the
dynamics of electron loss arising from hiss occur on timescales as short as one
to twenty minutes, in association with modulations in plasma density and magnetic
field. Furthermore, these loss dynamics are coherent with hiss dynamics on
spatial scales comparable to the size of the plasmasphere. This nearly
global-scale coherence was not predicted and may affect the short-term evolution 
of the radiation belts during active times.

Exosomes are lipid-bilayer-enclosed extracellular vesicles that contain proteins 
and nucleic acids. They are secreted by all cells and circulate in the blood.
Specific detection and isolation of cancer-cell-derived exosomes in the
circulation is currently lacking. Using mass spectrometry analyses, we identify a
cell surface proteoglycan, glypican-1 (GPC1), specifically enriched on
cancer-cell-derived exosomes. GPC1(+) circulating exosomes (crExos) were
monitored and isolated using flow cytometry from the serum of patients and mice
with cancer. GPC1(+) crExos were detected in the serum of patients with
pancreatic cancer with absolute specificity and sensitivity, distinguishing
healthy subjects and patients with a benign pancreatic disease from patients with
early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer. Levels of GPC1(+) crExos correlate with 
tumour burden and the survival of pre- and post-surgical patients. GPC1(+) crExos
from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific
KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice
despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging. GPC1(+) crExos may serve 
as a potential non-invasive diagnostic and screening tool to detect early stages 
of pancreatic cancer to facilitate possible curative surgical therapy.

Although the adult mammalian heart is incapable of meaningful functional recovery
following substantial cardiomyocyte loss, it is now clear that modest
cardiomyocyte turnover occurs in adult mouse and human hearts, mediated primarily
by proliferation of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. However, fate mapping of these
cycling cardiomyocytes has not been possible thus far owing to the lack of
identifiable genetic markers. In several organs, stem or progenitor cells reside 
in relatively hypoxic microenvironments where the stabilization of the
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif-1α) subunit is critical for their
maintenance and function. Here we report fate mapping of hypoxic cells and their 
progenies by generating a transgenic mouse expressing a chimaeric protein in
which the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of Hif-1α is fused to the
tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase. In mice bearing the creERT2-ODD
transgene driven by either the ubiquitous CAG promoter or the
cardiomyocyte-specific α myosin heavy chain promoter, we identify a rare
population of hypoxic cardiomyocytes that display characteristics of
proliferative neonatal cardiomyocytes, such as smaller size, mononucleation and
lower oxidative DNA damage. Notably, these hypoxic cardiomyocytes contributed
widely to new cardiomyocyte formation in the adult heart. These results indicate 
that hypoxia signalling is an important hallmark of cycling cardiomyocytes, and
suggest that hypoxia fate mapping can be a powerful tool for identifying cycling 
cells in adult mammals.

A prominent feature of the bacterial domain is a radiation of major lineages that
are defined as candidate phyla because they lack isolated representatives.
Bacteria from these phyla occur in diverse environments and are thought to
mediate carbon and hydrogen cycles. Genomic analyses of a few representatives
suggested that metabolic limitations have prevented their cultivation. Here we
reconstructed 8 complete and 789 draft genomes from bacteria representing >35
phyla and documented features that consistently distinguish these organisms from 
other bacteria. We infer that this group, which may comprise >15% of the
bacterial domain, has shared evolutionary history, and describe it as the
candidate phyla radiation (CPR). All CPR genomes are small and most lack numerous
biosynthetic pathways. Owing to divergent 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
sequences, 50-100% of organisms sampled from specific phyla would evade detection
in typical cultivation-independent surveys. CPR organisms often have
self-splicing introns and proteins encoded within their rRNA genes, a feature
rarely reported in bacteria. Furthermore, they have unusual ribosome
compositions. All are missing a ribosomal protein often absent in symbionts, and 
specific lineages are missing ribosomal proteins and biogenesis factors
considered universal in bacteria. This implies different ribosome structures and 
biogenesis mechanisms, and underlines unusual biology across a large part of the 
bacterial domain.

Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of emergence and circulation of new
human seasonal influenza virus variants is a key scientific and public health
challenge. The global circulation patterns of influenza A/H3N2 viruses are well
characterized, but the patterns of A/H1N1 and B viruses have remained largely
unexplored. Here we show that the global circulation patterns of A/H1N1 (up to
2009), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses differ substantially from those of
A/H3N2 viruses, on the basis of analyses of 9,604 haemagglutinin sequences of
human seasonal influenza viruses from 2000 to 2012. Whereas genetic variants of
A/H3N2 viruses did not persist locally between epidemics and were reseeded from
East and Southeast Asia, genetic variants of A/H1N1 and B viruses persisted
across several seasons and exhibited complex global dynamics with East and
Southeast Asia playing a limited role in disseminating new variants. The less
frequent global movement of influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with slower 
rates of antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection, and smaller, less frequent
epidemics compared to A/H3N2 viruses. Detailed epidemic models support
differences in age of infection, combined with the less frequent travel of
children, as probable drivers of the differences in the patterns of global
circulation, suggesting a complex interaction between virus evolution,
epidemiology, and human behaviour.

The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in
regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and
mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure. Here we perform
genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis, fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) 
maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage
compensation, which balances gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO
males. The dosage compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both 
hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements on X (rex 
sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Most DCC condensin
subunits also act in other condensin complexes to control the compaction and
resolution of all mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. By comparing chromosome
structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels
hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct
from autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting
domains (∼1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs).
TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries and more regular spacing than on
autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X chromosomes coincide with the
highest-affinity rex sites and become diminished or lost in DCC-defective
mutants, thereby converting the topology of X to a conformation resembling
autosomes. rex sites engage in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the
most frequent interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD
boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X
chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak boundaries through
interactions between its highest-affinity binding sites. As this model predicts, 
deletion of an endogenous rex site at a DCC-dependent TAD boundary using
CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the boundary. Thus, the DCC imposes a distinct
higher-order structure onto X chromosomes while regulating gene expression
chromosome-wide.

Understanding the diversity of human tissues is fundamental to disease and
requires linking genetic information, which is identical in most of an
individual's cells, with epigenetic mechanisms that could have tissue-specific
roles. Surveys of DNA methylation in human tissues have established a complex
landscape including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation patterns. Here
we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all
contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched
transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with
each individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread tissue-specific
differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific 
methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation 
(mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions,
and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome 
inactivation in specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic
contexts varies substantially among human tissues.

Melanoma treatment is being revolutionized by the development of effective
immunotherapeutic approaches. These strategies include blockade of
immune-inhibitory receptors on activated T cells; for example, using monoclonal
antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 (refs 3-5). However, only a subset of 
patients responds to these treatments, and data suggest that therapeutic benefit 
is preferentially achieved in patients with a pre-existing T-cell response
against their tumour, as evidenced by a baseline CD8(+) T-cell infiltration
within the tumour microenvironment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that
underlie the presence or absence of a spontaneous anti-tumour T-cell response in 
subsets of cases, therefore, should enable the development of therapeutic
solutions for patients lacking a T-cell infiltrate. Here we identify a
melanoma-cell-intrinsic oncogenic pathway that contributes to a lack of T-cell
infiltration in melanoma. Molecular analysis of human metastatic melanoma samples
revealed a correlation between activation of the WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway
and absence of a T-cell gene expression signature. Using autochthonous mouse
melanoma models we identified the mechanism by which tumour-intrinsic active
β-catenin signalling results in T-cell exclusion and resistance to
anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody therapy. Specific oncogenic signals,
therefore, can mediate cancer immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapies,
pointing to new candidate targets for immune potentiation.

Fundamental to all living organisms is the capacity to coordinate cell division
and cell differentiation to generate appropriate numbers of specialized cells.
Whereas eukaryotes use cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases to balance division
with cell fate decisions, equivalent regulatory systems have not been described
in bacteria. Moreover, the mechanisms used by bacteria to tune division in line
with developmental programs are poorly understood. Here we show that Caulobacter 
crescentus, a bacterium with an asymmetric division cycle, uses oscillating
levels of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) to drive its cell
cycle. We demonstrate that c-di-GMP directly binds to the essential cell cycle
kinase CckA to inhibit kinase activity and stimulate phosphatase activity. An
upshift of c-di-GMP during the G1-S transition switches CckA from the kinase to
the phosphatase mode, thereby allowing replication initiation and cell cycle
progression. Finally, we show that during division, c-di-GMP imposes spatial
control on CckA to install the replication asymmetry of future daughter cells.
These studies reveal c-di-GMP to be a cyclin-like molecule in bacteria that
coordinates chromosome replication with cell morphogenesis in Caulobacter. The
observation that c-di-GMP-mediated control is conserved in the plant pathogen
Agrobacterium tumefaciens suggests a general mechanism through which this global 
regulator of bacterial virulence and persistence coordinates behaviour and cell
proliferation.

Inflammation is a beneficial host response to infection but can contribute to
inflammatory disease if unregulated. The Th17 lineage of T helper (Th) cells can 
cause severe human inflammatory diseases. These cells exhibit both instability
(they can cease to express their signature cytokine, IL-17A) and plasticity (they
can start expressing cytokines typical of other lineages) upon in vitro
re-stimulation. However, technical limitations have prevented the transcriptional
profiling of pre- and post-conversion Th17 cells ex vivo during immune responses.
Thus, it is unknown whether Th17 cell plasticity merely reflects change in
expression of a few cytokines, or if Th17 cells physiologically undergo global
genetic reprogramming driving their conversion from one T helper cell type to
another, a process known as transdifferentiation. Furthermore, although Th17 cell
instability/plasticity has been associated with pathogenicity, it is unknown
whether this could present a therapeutic opportunity, whereby formerly pathogenic
Th17 cells could adopt an anti-inflammatory fate. Here we used two new
fate-mapping mouse models to track Th17 cells during immune responses to show
that CD4(+) T cells that formerly expressed IL-17A go on to acquire an
anti-inflammatory phenotype. The transdifferentiation of Th17 into regulatory T
cells was illustrated by a change in their signature transcriptional profile and 
the acquisition of potent regulatory capacity. Comparisons of the transcriptional
profiles of pre- and post-conversion Th17 cells also revealed a role for
canonical TGF-β signalling and consequently for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) in conversion. Thus, Th17 cells transdifferentiate into regulatory cells,
and contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Our data suggest that Th17 cell
instability and plasticity is a therapeutic opportunity for inflammatory
diseases.

Sex determination in animals is amazingly plastic. Vertebrates display
contrasting strategies ranging from complete genetic control of sex (genotypic
sex determination) to environmentally determined sex (for example,
temperature-dependent sex determination). Phylogenetic analyses suggest frequent 
evolutionary transitions between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex
determination in environmentally sensitive lineages, including reptiles. These
transitions are thought to involve a genotypic system becoming sensitive to
temperature, with sex determined by gene-environment interactions. Most
mechanistic models of transitions invoke a role for sex reversal. Sex reversal
has not yet been demonstrated in nature for any amniote, although it occurs in
fish and rarely in amphibians. Here we make the first report of reptile sex
reversal in the wild, in the Australian bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps), and
use sex-reversed animals to experimentally induce a rapid transition from
genotypic to temperature-dependent sex determination. Controlled mating of normal
males to sex-reversed females produces viable and fertile offspring whose
phenotypic sex is determined solely by temperature (temperature-dependent sex
determination). The W sex chromosome is eliminated from this lineage in the first
generation. The instantaneous creation of a lineage of ZZ temperature-sensitive
animals reveals a novel, climate-induced pathway for the rapid transition between
genetic and temperature-dependent sex determination, and adds to concern about
adaptation to rapid global climate change.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the major source of variability in winter
atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, with large impacts on
temperature, precipitation and storm tracks, and therefore also on strategic
sectors such as insurance, renewable energy production, crop yields and water
management. Recent developments in dynamical methods offer promise to improve
seasonal NAO predictions, but assessing potential predictability on multi-annual 
timescales requires documentation of past low-frequency variability in the NAO. A
recent bi-proxy NAO reconstruction spanning the past millennium suggested that
long-lasting positive NAO conditions were established during medieval times,
explaining the particularly warm conditions in Europe during this period;
however, these conclusions are debated. Here, we present a yearly NAO
reconstruction for the past millennium, based on an initial selection of 48
annually resolved proxy records distributed around the Atlantic Ocean and built
through an ensemble of multivariate regressions. We validate the approach in six 
past-millennium climate simulations, and show that our reconstruction outperforms
the bi-proxy index. The final reconstruction shows no persistent positive NAO
during the medieval period, but suggests that positive phases were dominant
during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The reconstruction also reveals
that a positive NAO emerges two years after strong volcanic eruptions, consistent
with results obtained from models and satellite observations for the Mt Pinatubo 
eruption in the Philippines.

Spectroscopy is carried out in almost every field of science, whenever light
interacts with matter. Although sophisticated instruments with impressive
performance characteristics are available, much effort continues to be invested
in the development of miniaturized, cheap and easy-to-use systems. Current
microspectrometer designs mostly use interference filters and interferometric
optics that limit their photon efficiency, resolution and spectral range. Here we
show that many of these limitations can be overcome by replacing interferometric 
optics with a two-dimensional absorptive filter array composed of colloidal
quantum dots. Instead of measuring different bands of a spectrum individually
after introducing temporal or spatial separations with gratings or
interference-based narrowband filters, a colloidal quantum dot spectrometer
measures a light spectrum based on the wavelength multiplexing principle:
multiple spectral bands are encoded and detected simultaneously with one filter
and one detector, respectively, with the array format allowing the process to be 
efficiently repeated many times using different filters with different encoding
so that sufficient information is obtained to enable computational reconstruction
of the target spectrum. We illustrate the performance of such a quantum dot
microspectrometer, made from 195 different types of quantum dots with absorption 
features that cover a spectral range of 300 nanometres, by measuring shifts in
spectral peak positions as small as one nanometre. Given this performance,
demonstrable avenues for further improvement, the ease with which quantum dots
can be processed and integrated, and their numerous finely tuneable bandgaps that
cover a broad spectral range, we expect that quantum dot microspectrometers will 
be useful in applications where minimizing size, weight, cost and complexity of
the spectrometer are critical.

Pits have been observed on many cometary nuclei mapped by spacecraft. It has been
argued that cometary pits are a signature of endogenic activity, rather than
impact craters such as those on planetary and asteroid surfaces. Impact
experiments and models cannot reproduce the shapes of most of the observed
cometary pits, and the predicted collision rates imply that few of the pits are
related to impacts. Alternative mechanisms like explosive activity have been
suggested, but the driving process remains unknown. Here we report that pits on
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are active, and probably created by a sinkhole
process, possibly accompanied by outbursts. We argue that after formation, pits
expand slowly in diameter, owing to sublimation-driven retreat of the walls.
Therefore, pits characterize how eroded the surface is: a fresh cometary surface 
will have a ragged structure with many pits, while an evolved surface will look
smoother. The size and spatial distribution of pits imply that large
heterogeneities exist in the physical, structural or compositional properties of 
the first few hundred metres below the current nucleus surface.

Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized
intra-cluster medium. Still forming under the action of gravitational
instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows
partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks,
while residual transonic (near-sonic) flows create giant turbulent eddies and
cascades. Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium and also amplifies magnetic
energy by way of dynamo action. However, the pattern regulating the
transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and
magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of
the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which
the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually 
unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual 
component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This
result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence
generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion,
revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation. The
permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of
self-similarity in cosmology, while its structure, consistent with current data, 
encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.

In response to DNA damage, tissue homoeostasis is ensured by protein networks
promoting DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. DNA damage response
signalling pathways coordinate these processes, partly by propagating
gene-expression-modulating signals. DNA damage influences not only the abundance 
of messenger RNAs, but also their coding information through alternative
splicing. Here we show that transcription-blocking DNA lesions promote chromatin 
displacement of late-stage spliceosomes and initiate a positive feedback loop
centred on the signalling kinase ATM. We propose that initial spliceosome
displacement and subsequent R-loop formation is triggered by pausing of RNA
polymerase at DNA lesions. In turn, R-loops activate ATM, which signals to impede
spliceosome organization further and augment ultraviolet-irradiation-triggered
alternative splicing at the genome-wide level. Our findings define
R-loop-dependent ATM activation by transcription-blocking lesions as an important
event in the DNA damage response of non-replicating cells, and highlight a key
role for spliceosome displacement in this process.

The molecularly defined clade Ecdysozoa comprises the panarthropods
(Euarthropoda, Onychophora and Tardigrada) and the cycloneuralian worms
(Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Priapulida, Loricifera and Kinorhyncha). These disparate
phyla are united by their means of moulting, but otherwise share few
morphological characters--none of which has a meaningful fossilization potential.
As such, the early evolutionary history of the group as a whole is largely
uncharted. Here we redescribe the 508-million-year-old stem-group onychophoran
Hallucigenia sparsa from the mid-Cambrian Burgess Shale. We document an elongate 
head with a pair of simple eyes, a terminal buccal chamber containing a radial
array of sclerotized elements, and a differentiated foregut that is lined with
acicular teeth. The radial elements and pharyngeal teeth resemble the sclerotized
circumoral elements and pharyngeal teeth expressed in tardigrades, stem-group
euarthropods and cycloneuralian worms. Phylogenetic results indicate that
equivalent structures characterized the ancestral panarthropod and, seemingly,
the ancestral ecdysozoan, demonstrating the deep homology of panarthropod and
cycloneuralian mouthparts, and providing an anatomical synapomorphy for the
ecdysozoan supergroup.

U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is a 1.5-megadalton pre-assembled spliceosomal complex
comprising U5 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), extensively base-paired U4/U6 snRNAs and
more than 30 proteins, including the key components Prp8, Brr2 and Snu114. The
tri-snRNP combines with a precursor messenger RNA substrate bound to U1 and U2
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), and transforms into a
catalytically active spliceosome after extensive compositional and conformational
changes triggered by unwinding of the U4 and U6 (U4/U6) snRNAs. Here we use
cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae tri-snRNP at 5.9 Å resolution to reveal the essentially complete

Synapse formation is a process tightly controlled in space and time. How gene
regulatory mechanisms specify spatial and temporal aspects of synapse formation
is not well understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two subtypes of
the D-type inhibitory motor neuron (MN) classes, the dorsal D (DD) and ventral D 
(VD) neurons, extend axons along both the dorsal and ventral nerve cords. The
embryonically generated DD motor neurons initially innervate ventral muscles in
the first (L1) larval stage and receive their synaptic input from cholinergic
motor neurons in the dorsal cord. They rewire by the end of the L1 moult to
innervate dorsal muscles and to be innervated by newly formed ventral cholinergic
motor neurons. VD motor neurons develop after the L1 moult; they take over the
innervation of ventral muscles and receive their synaptic input from dorsal
cholinergic motor neurons. We show here that the spatiotemporal control of
synaptic wiring of the D-type neurons is controlled by an intersectional
transcriptional strategy in which the UNC-30 Pitx-type homeodomain transcription 
factor acts together, in embryonic and early larval stages, with the temporally
controlled LIN-14 transcription factor to prevent premature synapse rewiring of
the DD motor neurons and, together with the UNC-55 nuclear hormone receptor, to
prevent aberrant VD synaptic wiring in later larval and adult stages. A key
effector of this intersectional transcription factor combination is a novel
synaptic organizer molecule, the single immunoglobulin domain protein OIG-1.
OIG-1 is perisynaptically localized along the synaptic outputs of the D-type
motor neurons in a temporally controlled manner and is required for appropriate
selection of both pre- and post-synaptic partners.

Cells sense the context in which they grow to adapt their phenotype and allow
multicellular patterning by mechanisms of autocrine and paracrine signalling.
However, patterns also form in cell populations exposed to the same signalling
molecules and substratum, which often correlate with specific features of the
population context of single cells, such as local cell crowding. Here we reveal a
cell-intrinsic molecular mechanism that allows multicellular patterning without
requiring specific communication between cells. It acts by sensing the local
crowding of a single cell through its ability to spread and activate focal
adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2), resulting in adaptation of genes
controlling membrane homeostasis. In cells experiencing low crowding, FAK
suppresses transcription of the ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) by inhibiting FOXO3
and TAL1. Agent-based computational modelling and experimental confirmation
identified membrane-based signalling and feedback control as crucial for the
emergence of population patterns of ABCA1 expression, which adapts membrane lipid
composition to cell crowding and affects multiple signalling activities,
including the suppression of ABCA1 expression itself. The simple design of this
cell-intrinsic system and its broad impact on the signalling state of mammalian
single cells suggests a fundamental role for a tunable membrane lipid composition
in collective cell behaviour.

Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), the 'gatekeeper' of glycolysis, catalyses the
committed step of the glycolytic pathway by converting fructose-6-phosphate to
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Allosteric activation and inhibition of PFK1 by over
ten metabolites and in response to hormonal signalling fine-tune glycolytic flux 
to meet energy requirements. Mutations inhibiting PFK1 activity cause glycogen
storage disease type VII, also known as Tarui disease, and mice deficient in
muscle PFK1 have decreased fat stores. Additionally, PFK1 is proposed to have
important roles in metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Despite its critical role
in glucose flux, the biologically relevant crystal structure of the mammalian
PFK1 tetramer has not been determined. Here we report the first structures of the
mammalian PFK1 tetramer, for the human platelet isoform (PFKP), in complex with
ATP-Mg(2+) and ADP at 3.1 and 3.4 Å, respectively. The structures reveal
substantial conformational changes in the enzyme upon nucleotide hydrolysis as
well as a unique tetramer interface. Mutations of residues in this interface can 
affect tetramer formation, enzyme catalysis and regulation, indicating the
functional importance of the tetramer. With altered glycolytic flux being a
hallmark of cancers, these new structures allow a molecular understanding of the 
functional consequences of somatic PFK1 mutations identified in human cancers. We
characterize three of these mutations and show they have distinct effects on
allosteric regulation of PFKP activity and lactate production. The PFKP
structural blueprint for somatic mutations as well as the catalytic site can
guide therapeutic targeting of PFK1 activity to control dysregulated glycolysis
in disease.

The tumour microenvironment may contribute to tumorigenesis owing to mechanical
forces such as fibrotic stiffness or mechanical pressure caused by the expansion 
of hyper-proliferative cells. Here we explore the contribution of the mechanical 
pressure exerted by tumour growth onto non-tumorous adjacent epithelium. In the
early stage of mouse colon tumour development in the Notch(+)Apc(+/1638N) mouse
model, we observed mechanistic pressure stress in the non-tumorous epithelial
cells caused by hyper-proliferative adjacent crypts overexpressing active Notch, 
which is associated with increased Ret and β-catenin signalling. We thus
developed a method that allows the delivery of a defined mechanical pressure in
vivo, by subcutaneously inserting a magnet close to the mouse colon. The
implanted magnet generated a magnetic force on ultra-magnetic liposomes,
stabilized in the mesenchymal cells of the connective tissue surrounding colonic 
crypts after intravenous injection. The magnetically induced pressure
quantitatively mimicked the endogenous early tumour growth stress in the order of
1,200 Pa, without affecting tissue stiffness, as monitored by ultrasound strain
imaging and shear wave elastography. The exertion of pressure mimicking that of
tumour growth led to rapid Ret activation and downstream phosphorylation of
β-catenin on Tyr654, imparing its interaction with the E-cadherin in adherens
junctions, and which was followed by β-catenin nuclear translocation after 15
days. As a consequence, increased expression of β-catenin-target genes was
observed at 1 month, together with crypt enlargement accompanying the formation
of early tumorous aberrant crypt foci. Mechanical activation of the tumorigenic
β-catenin pathway suggests unexplored modes of tumour propagation based on
mechanical signalling pathways in healthy epithelial cells surrounding the
tumour, which may contribute to tumour heterogeneity.

Deregulated expression of the MYC transcription factor occurs in most human
cancers and correlates with high proliferation, reprogrammed cellular metabolism 
and poor prognosis. Overexpressed MYC binds to virtually all active promoters
within a cell, although with different binding affinities, and modulates the
expression of distinct subsets of genes. However, the critical effectors of MYC
in tumorigenesis remain largely unknown. Here we show that during lymphomagenesis
in Eµ-myc transgenic mice, MYC directly upregulates the transcription of the core
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle assembly genes, including Prmt5, an
arginine methyltransferase that methylates Sm proteins. This coordinated
regulatory effect is critical for the core biogenesis of small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein particles, effective pre-messenger-RNA splicing, cell survival 
and proliferation. Our results demonstrate that MYC maintains the splicing
fidelity of exons with a weak 5' donor site. Additionally, we identify
pre-messenger-RNAs that are particularly sensitive to the perturbation of the
MYC-PRMT5 axis, resulting in either intron retention (for example, Dvl1) or exon 
skipping (for example, Atr, Ep400). Using antisense oligonucleotides, we
demonstrate the contribution of these splicing defects to the
anti-proliferative/apoptotic phenotype observed in PRMT5-depleted Eµ-myc B cells.
We conclude that, in addition to its well-documented oncogenic functions in
transcription and translation, MYC also safeguards proper pre-messenger-RNA
splicing as an essential step in lymphomagenesis.

Intramembrane proteases catalyse the signal-generating step of various cell
signalling pathways, and continue to be implicated in diseases ranging from
malaria infection to Parkinsonian neurodegeneration. Despite playing such
decisive roles, it remains unclear whether or how these membrane-immersed enzymes
might be regulated directly. To address this limitation, here we focus on
intramembrane proteases containing domains known to exert regulatory functions in
other contexts, and characterize a rhomboid protease that harbours
calcium-binding EF-hands. We find calcium potently stimulates proteolysis by
endogenous rhomboid-4 in Drosophila cells, and, remarkably, when rhomboid-4 is
purified and reconstituted in liposomes. Interestingly, deleting the
amino-terminal EF-hands activates proteolysis prematurely, while residues in
cytoplasmic loops connecting distal transmembrane segments mediate calcium
stimulation. Rhomboid regulation is not orchestrated by either dimerization or
substrate interactions. Instead, calcium increases catalytic rate by promoting
substrate gating. Substrates with cleavage sites outside the membrane can be
cleaved but lose the capacity to be regulated. These observations indicate
substrate gating is not an essential step in catalysis, but instead evolved as a 
mechanism for regulating proteolysis inside the membrane. Moreover, these
insights provide new approaches for studying rhomboid functions by investigating 
upstream inputs that trigger proteolysis.

Active segregation of Escherichia coli low-copy-number plasmid R1 involves
formation of a bipolar spindle made of left-handed double-helical actin-like ParM
filaments. ParR links the filaments with centromeric parC plasmid DNA, while
facilitating the addition of subunits to ParM filaments. Growing ParMRC spindles 
push sister plasmids to the cell poles. Here, using modern electron
cryomicroscopy methods, we investigate the structures and arrangements of ParM
filaments in vitro and in cells, revealing at near-atomic resolution how subunits
and filaments come together to produce the simplest known mitotic machinery. To
understand the mechanism of dynamic instability, we determine structures of ParM 
filaments in different nucleotide states. The structure of filaments bound to the
ATP analogue AMPPNP is determined at 4.3 Å resolution and refined. The ParM
filament structure shows strong longitudinal interfaces and weaker lateral
interactions. Also using electron cryomicroscopy, we reconstruct ParM doublets
forming antiparallel spindles. Finally, with whole-cell electron cryotomography, 
we show that doublets are abundant in bacterial cells containing low-copy-number 
plasmids with the ParMRC locus, leading to an asynchronous model of R1 plasmid
segregation.

Tumour formation is blocked by two barriers: replicative senescence and crisis.
Senescence is triggered by short telomeres and is bypassed by disruption of
tumour-suppressive pathways. After senescence bypass, cells undergo crisis,
during which almost all of the cells in the population die. Cells that escape
crisis harbour unstable genomes and other parameters of transformation. The
mechanism of cell death during crisis remains unexplained. Here we show that
human cells in crisis undergo spontaneous mitotic arrest, resulting in death
during mitosis or in the following cell cycle. This phenotype is induced by loss 
of p53 function, and is suppressed by telomerase overexpression. Telomere fusions
triggered mitotic arrest in p53-compromised non-crisis cells, indicating that
such fusions are the underlying cause of cell death. Exacerbation of mitotic
telomere deprotection by partial TRF2 (also known as TERF2) knockdown increased
the ratio of cells that died during mitotic arrest and sensitized cancer cells to
mitotic poisons. We propose a crisis pathway wherein chromosome fusions induce
mitotic arrest, resulting in mitotic telomere deprotection and cell death,
thereby eliminating precancerous cells from the population.

Surface weather conditions are closely governed by the large-scale circulation of
the Earth's atmosphere. Recent increases in the occurrence of some extreme
weather phenomena have led to multiple mechanistic hypotheses linking changes in 
atmospheric circulation to increasing probability of extreme events. However,
observed evidence of long-term change in atmospheric circulation remains
inconclusive. Here we identify statistically significant trends in the occurrence
of atmospheric circulation patterns, which partially explain observed trends in
surface temperature extremes over seven mid-latitude regions of the Northern
Hemisphere. Using self-organizing map cluster analysis, we detect robust
circulation pattern trends in a subset of these regions during both the satellite
observation era (1979-2013) and the recent period of rapid Arctic sea-ice decline
(1990-2013). Particularly substantial influences include the contribution of
increasing trends in anticyclonic circulations to summer and autumn hot extremes 
over portions of Eurasia and North America, and the contribution of increasing
trends in northerly flow to winter cold extremes over central Asia. Our results
indicate that although a substantial portion of the observed change in extreme
temperature occurrence has resulted from regional- and global-scale thermodynamic
changes, the risk of extreme temperatures over some regions has also been altered
by recent changes in the frequency, persistence and maximum duration of regional 
circulation patterns.

When intense light interacts with an atomic gas, recollision between an ionizing 
electron and its parent ion creates high-order harmonics of the fundamental laser
frequency. This sub-cycle effect generates coherent soft X-rays and attosecond
pulses, and provides a means to image molecular orbitals. Recently, high
harmonics have been generated from bulk crystals, but what mechanism dominates
the emission remains uncertain. To resolve this issue, we adapt measurement
methods from gas-phase research to solid zinc oxide driven by mid-infrared laser 
fields of 0.25 volts per ångström. We find that when we alter the generation
process with a second-harmonic beam, the modified harmonic spectrum bears the
signature of a generalized recollision between an electron and its associated
hole. In addition, we find that solid-state high harmonics are perturbed by
fields so weak that they are present in conventional electronic circuits, thus
opening a route to integrate electronics with attosecond and high-harmonic
technology. Future experiments will permit the band structure of a solid to be
tomographically reconstructed.

Exoplanets orbiting close to their parent stars may lose some fraction of their
atmospheres because of the extreme irradiation. Atmospheric mass loss primarily
affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to the suggestion that hot rocky planets
might have begun as Neptune-like, but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres;
however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of
this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its 
escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit
signatures than in the optical spectrum. Here we report that in the ultraviolet
the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths
of 56.3 ± 3.5% (1σ), far beyond the 0.69% optical transit depth. The ultraviolet 
transits repeatedly start about two hours before, and end more than three hours
after the approximately one hour optical transit, which is substantially
different from one previous claim (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer
from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud
composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of
about 10(8)-10(9) grams per second, which is far too small to deplete the
atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would
have been much greater in the past.

The rest-frame ultraviolet properties of galaxies during the first three billion 
years of cosmic time (redshift z > 4) indicate a rapid evolution in the dust
obscuration of such galaxies. This evolution implies a change in the average
properties of the interstellar medium, but the measurements are systematically
uncertain owing to untested assumptions and the inability to detect heavily
obscured regions of the galaxies. Previous attempts to measure the interstellar
medium directly in normal galaxies at these redshifts have failed for a number of
reasons, with two notable exceptions. Here we report measurements of the
forbidden C ii emission (that is, [C II]) from gas, and the far-infrared emission
from dust, in nine typical star-forming galaxies about one billion years after
the Big Bang (z ≈ 5-6). We find that these galaxies have thermal emission that is
less than 1/12 that of similar systems about two billion years later, and
enhanced [C II] emission relative to the far-infrared continuum, confirming a
strong evolution in the properties of the interstellar medium in the early
Universe. The gas is distributed over scales of one to eight kiloparsecs, and
shows diverse dynamics within the sample. These results are consistent with early
galaxies having significantly less dust than typical galaxies seen at z < 3 and
being comparable in dust content to local low-metallicity systems.

Antarctic biodiversity is much more extensive, ecologically diverse and
biogeographically structured than previously thought. Understanding of how this
diversity is distributed in marine and terrestrial systems, the mechanisms
underlying its spatial variation, and the significance of the microbiota is
growing rapidly. Broadly recognizable drivers of diversity variation include
energy availability and historical refugia. The impacts of local human activities
and global environmental change nonetheless pose challenges to the current and
future understanding of Antarctic biodiversity. Life in the Antarctic and the
Southern Ocean is surprisingly rich, and as much at risk from environmental
change as it is elsewhere.

The bacterial ubiD and ubiX or the homologous fungal fdc1 and pad1 genes have
been implicated in the non-oxidative reversible decarboxylation of aromatic
substrates, and play a pivotal role in bacterial ubiquinone (also known as
coenzyme Q) biosynthesis or microbial biodegradation of aromatic compounds,
respectively. Despite biochemical studies on individual gene products, the
composition and cofactor requirement of the enzyme responsible for in vivo
decarboxylase activity remained unclear. Here we show that Fdc1 is solely
responsible for the reversible decarboxylase activity, and that it requires a new
type of cofactor: a prenylated flavin synthesized by the associated UbiX/Pad1.
Atomic resolution crystal structures reveal that two distinct isomers of the
oxidized cofactor can be observed, an isoalloxazine N5-iminium adduct and a N5
secondary ketimine species with markedly altered ring structure, both having
azomethine ylide character. Substrate binding positions the dipolarophile enoic
acid group directly above the azomethine ylide group. The structure of a covalent
inhibitor-cofactor adduct suggests that 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry
supports reversible decarboxylation in these enzymes. Although 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition is commonly used in organic chemistry, we propose that this
presents the first example, to our knowledge, of an enzymatic 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition reaction. Our model for Fdc1/UbiD catalysis offers new routes in
alkene hydrocarbon production or aryl (de)carboxylation.

Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption
exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central
fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two
isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative
splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared
with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose
metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia
actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac
hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) activation of SF3B1 and
SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of
SF3B1 or genetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses
pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile
dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a
fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.

During development, cells interpret complex and often conflicting signals to make
optimal decisions. Plant stomata, the cellular interface between a plant and the 
atmosphere, develop according to positional cues, which include a family of
secreted peptides called epidermal patterning factors (EPFs). How these
signalling peptides orchestrate pattern formation at a molecular level remains
unclear. Here we report in Arabidopsis that Stomagen (also called EPF-LIKE9)
peptide, which promotes stomatal development, requires ERECTA (ER)-family
receptor kinases and interferes with the inhibition of stomatal development by
the EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 2 (EPF2)-ER module. Both EPF2 and Stomagen
directly bind to ER and its co-receptor TOO MANY MOUTHS. Stomagen peptide
competitively replaced EPF2 binding to ER. Furthermore, application of EPF2, but 
not Stomagen, elicited rapid phosphorylation of downstream signalling components 
in vivo. Our findings demonstrate how a plant receptor agonist and antagonist
define inhibitory and inductive cues to fine-tune tissue patterning on the plant 
epidermis.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is a multimeric RING E3 ubiquitin ligase
that controls chromosome segregation and mitotic exit. Its regulation by
coactivator subunits, phosphorylation, the mitotic checkpoint complex and
interphase early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi1) ensures the correct order and timing 
of distinct cell-cycle transitions. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to
determine atomic structures of APC/C-coactivator complexes with either Emi1 or a 
UbcH10-ubiquitin conjugate. These structures define the architecture of all APC/C
subunits, the position of the catalytic module and explain how Emi1 mediates
inhibition of the two E2s UbcH10 and Ube2S. Definition of Cdh1 interactions with 
the APC/C indicates how they are antagonized by Cdh1 phosphorylation. The
structure of the APC/C with UbcH10-ubiquitin reveals insights into the initiating
ubiquitination reaction. Our results provide a quantitative framework for the
design of future experiments to investigate APC/C functions in vivo.

Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is a ubiquitous lipid-soluble redox
cofactor that is an essential component of electron transfer chains. Eleven genes
have been implicated in bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis, including ubiX and
ubiD, which are responsible for decarboxylation of the
3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate precursor. Despite structural and biochemical
characterization of UbiX as a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein, no
decarboxylase activity has been detected. Here we report that UbiX produces a
novel flavin-derived cofactor required for the decarboxylase activity of UbiD.
UbiX acts as a flavin prenyltransferase, linking a dimethylallyl moiety to the
flavin N5 and C6 atoms. This adds a fourth non-aromatic ring to the flavin
isoalloxazine group. In contrast to other prenyltransferases, UbiX is
metal-independent and requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate as substrate. Kinetic 
crystallography reveals that the prenyltransferase mechanism of UbiX resembles
that of the terpene synthases. The active site environment is dominated by π
systems, which assist phosphate-C1' bond breakage following FMN reduction,
leading to formation of the N5-C1' bond. UbiX then acts as a chaperone for adduct
reorientation, via transient carbocation species, leading ultimately to formation
of the dimethylallyl C3'-C6 bond. Our findings establish the mechanism for
formation of a new flavin-derived cofactor, extending both flavin and terpenoid
biochemical repertoires.

Mammalian prions, transmissible agents causing lethal neurodegenerative diseases,
are composed of assemblies of misfolded cellular prion protein (PrP). A novel PrP
variant, G127V, was under positive evolutionary selection during the epidemic of 
kuru--an acquired prion disease epidemic of the Fore population in Papua New
Guinea--and appeared to provide strong protection against disease in the
heterozygous state. Here we have investigated the protective role of this variant
and its interaction with the common, worldwide M129V PrP polymorphism. V127 was
seen exclusively on a M129 PRNP allele. We demonstrate that transgenic mice
expressing both variant and wild-type human PrP are completely resistant to both 
kuru and classical Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) prions (which are closely
similar) but can be infected with variant CJD prions, a human prion strain
resulting from exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions to which the
Fore were not exposed. Notably, mice expressing only PrP V127 were completely
resistant to all prion strains, demonstrating a different molecular mechanism to 
M129V, which provides its relative protection against classical CJD and kuru in
the heterozygous state. Indeed, this single amino acid substitution (G→V) at a
residue invariant in vertebrate evolution is as protective as deletion of the
protein. Further study in transgenic mice expressing different ratios of variant 
and wild-type PrP indicates that not only is PrP V127 completely refractory to
prion conversion but acts as a potent dose-dependent inhibitor of wild-type prion
propagation.

Reproduction through sex carries substantial costs, mainly because only half of
sexual adults produce offspring. It has been theorized that these costs could be 
countered if sex allows sexual selection to clear the universal fitness
constraint of mutation load. Under sexual selection, competition between
(usually) males and mate choice by (usually) females create important
intraspecific filters for reproductive success, so that only a subset of males
gains paternity. If reproductive success under sexual selection is dependent on
individual condition, which is contingent to mutation load, then sexually
selected filtering through 'genic capture' could offset the costs of sex because 
it provides genetic benefits to populations. Here we test this theory
experimentally by comparing whether populations with histories of strong versus
weak sexual selection purge mutation load and resist extinction differently.
After evolving replicate populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum for 
6 to 7 years under conditions that differed solely in the strengths of sexual
selection, we revealed mutation load using inbreeding. Lineages from populations 
that had previously experienced strong sexual selection were resilient to
extinction and maintained fitness under inbreeding, with some families continuing
to survive after 20 generations of sib × sib mating. By contrast, lineages
derived from populations that experienced weak or non-existent sexual selection
showed rapid fitness declines under inbreeding, and all were extinct after
generation 10. Multiple mutations across the genome with individually small
effects can be difficult to clear, yet sum to a significant fitness load; our
findings reveal that sexual selection reduces this load, improving population
viability in the face of genetic stress.

Many acute and chronic anaemias, including haemolysis, sepsis and genetic bone
marrow failure diseases such as Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, are not treatable with 
erythropoietin (Epo), because the colony-forming unit erythroid progenitors
(CFU-Es) that respond to Epo are either too few in number or are not sensitive
enough to Epo to maintain sufficient red blood cell production. Treatment of
these anaemias requires a drug that acts at an earlier stage of red cell
formation and enhances the formation of Epo-sensitive CFU-E progenitors.
Recently, we showed that glucocorticoids specifically stimulate self-renewal of
an early erythroid progenitor, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and increase
the production of terminally differentiated erythroid cells. Here we show that
activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) by the
PPAR-α agonists GW7647 and fenofibrate synergizes with the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) to promote BFU-E self-renewal. Over time these agonists greatly
increase production of mature red blood cells in cultures of both mouse fetal
liver BFU-Es and mobilized human adult CD34(+) peripheral blood progenitors, with
a new and effective culture system being used for the human cells that generates 
normal enucleated reticulocytes. Although Ppara(-/-) mice show no haematological 
difference from wild-type mice in both normal and phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced
stress erythropoiesis, PPAR-α agonists facilitate recovery of wild-type but not
Ppara(-/-) mice from PHZ-induced acute haemolytic anaemia. We also show that
PPAR-α alleviates anaemia in a mouse model of chronic anaemia. Finally, both in
control and corticosteroid-treated BFU-E cells, PPAR-α co-occupies many chromatin
sites with GR; when activated by PPAR-α agonists, additional PPAR-α is recruited 
to GR-adjacent sites and presumably facilitates GR-dependent BFU-E self-renewal. 
Our discovery of the role of PPAR-α agonists in stimulating self-renewal of early
erythroid progenitor cells suggests that the clinically tested PPAR-α agonists we
used may improve the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating Epo-resistant
anaemias.

Disruption of epithelial polarity is a key event in the acquisition of neoplastic
growth. JNK signalling is known to play an important part in driving the
malignant progression of many epithelial tumours, although the link between loss 
of polarity and JNK signalling remains elusive. In a Drosophila genome-wide
genetic screen designed to identify molecules implicated in neoplastic growth, we
identified grindelwald (grnd), a gene encoding a transmembrane protein with
homology to members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily.
Here we show that Grnd mediates the pro-apoptotic functions of Eiger (Egr), the
unique Drosophila TNF, and that overexpression of an active form of Grnd lacking 
the extracellular domain is sufficient to activate JNK signalling in vivo. Grnd
also promotes the invasiveness of Ras(V12)/scrib(-/-) tumours through
Egr-dependent Matrix metalloprotease-1 (Mmp1) expression. Grnd localizes to the
subapical membrane domain with the cell polarity determinant Crumbs (Crb) and
couples Crb-induced loss of polarity with JNK activation and neoplastic growth
through physical interaction with Veli (also known as Lin-7). Therefore, Grnd
represents the first example of a TNFR that integrates signals from both Egr and 
apical polarity determinants to induce JNK-dependent cell death or tumour growth.

HIV-1 immunotherapy with a combination of first generation monoclonal antibodies 
was largely ineffective in pre-clinical and clinical settings and was therefore
abandoned. However, recently developed single-cell-based antibody cloning methods
have uncovered a new generation of far more potent broadly neutralizing
antibodies to HIV-1 (refs 4, 5). These antibodies can prevent infection and
suppress viraemia in humanized mice and nonhuman primates, but their potential
for human HIV-1 immunotherapy has not been evaluated. Here we report the results 
of a first-in-man dose escalation phase 1 clinical trial of 3BNC117, a potent
human CD4 binding site antibody, in uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals.
3BNC117 infusion was well tolerated and demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetics.
A single 30 mg kg(-1) infusion of 3BNC117 reduced the viral load in
HIV-1-infected individuals by 0.8-2.5 log10 and viraemia remained significantly
reduced for 28 days. Emergence of resistant viral strains was variable, with some
individuals remaining sensitive to 3BNC117 for a period of 28 days. We conclude
that, as a single agent, 3BNC117 is safe and effective in reducing HIV-1
viraemia, and that immunotherapy should be explored as a new modality for HIV-1
prevention, therapy and cure.

Stress is considered a potent environmental risk factor for many behavioural
abnormalities, including anxiety and mood disorders. Animal models can exhibit
limited but quantifiable behavioural impairments resulting from chronic stress,
including deficits in motivation, abnormal responses to behavioural challenges,
and anhedonia. The hippocampus is thought to negatively regulate the stress
response and to mediate various cognitive and mnemonic aspects of stress-induced 
impairments, although the neuronal underpinnings sufficient to support
behavioural improvements are largely unknown. Here we acutely rescue
stress-induced depression-related behaviours in mice by optogenetically
reactivating dentate gyrus cells that were previously active during a positive
experience. A brain-wide histological investigation, coupled with pharmacological
and projection-specific optogenetic blockade experiments, identified
glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus-amygdala-nucleus-accumbens pathway as a
candidate circuit supporting the acute rescue. Finally, chronically reactivating 
hippocampal cells associated with a positive memory resulted in the rescue of
stress-induced behavioural impairments and neurogenesis at time points beyond the
light stimulation. Together, our data suggest that activating positive memories
artificially is sufficient to suppress depression-like behaviours and point to
dentate gyrus engram cells as potential therapeutic nodes for intervening with
maladaptive behavioural states.

The ability of an atom or molecular fragment to bind multiple carbon monoxide
(CO) molecules to form multicarbonyl adducts is a fundamental trait of transition
metals. Transition-metal carbonyl complexes are vital to industry, appear
naturally in the active sites of a number of enzymes (such as hydrogenases), are 
promising therapeutic agents, and have even been observed in interstellar dust
clouds. Despite the wealth of established transition-metal multicarbonyl
complexes, no elements outside groups 4 to 12 of the periodic table have yet been
shown to react directly with two or more CO units to form stable multicarbonyl
adducts. Here we present the synthesis of a borylene dicarbonyl complex, the
first multicarbonyl complex of a main-group element prepared using CO. The
compound is additionally stable towards ambient air and moisture. The synthetic
strategy used--liberation of a borylene ligand from a transition metal using
donor ligands--is broadly applicable, leading to a number of unprecedented
monovalent boron species with different Lewis basic groups. The similarity of
these compounds to conventional transition-metal carbonyl complexes is
demonstrated by photolytic liberation of CO and subsequent intramolecular
carbon-carbon bond activation.

Interplanetary dust particles hit the surfaces of airless bodies in the Solar
System, generating charged and neutral gas clouds, as well as secondary ejecta
dust particles. Gravitationally bound ejecta clouds that form dust exospheres
were recognized by in situ dust instruments around the icy moons of Jupiter and
Saturn, but have hitherto not been observed near bodies with refractory regolith 
surfaces. High-altitude Apollo 15 and 17 observations of a 'horizon glow'
indicated a putative population of high-density small dust particles near the
lunar terminators, although later orbital observations yielded upper limits on
the abundance of such particles that were a factor of about 10(4) lower than that
necessary to produce the Apollo results. Here we report observations of a
permanent, asymmetric dust cloud around the Moon, caused by impacts of high-speed
cometary dust particles on eccentric orbits, as opposed to particles of
asteroidal origin following near-circular paths striking the Moon at lower
speeds. The density of the lunar ejecta cloud increases during the annual meteor 
showers, especially the Geminids, because the lunar surface is exposed to the
same stream of interplanetary dust particles. We expect all airless planetary
objects to be immersed in similar tenuous clouds of dust.

Extrasolar planets that pass in front of their host star (transit) cause a
temporary decrease in the apparent brightness of the star, providing a direct
measure of the planet's size and orbital period. In some systems with multiple
transiting planets, the times of the transits are measurably affected by the
gravitational interactions between neighbouring planets. In favourable cases, the
departures from Keplerian orbits (that is, unaffected by gravitational effects)
implied by the observed transit times permit the planetary masses to be measured,
which is key to determining their bulk densities. Characterizing rocky planets is
particularly difficult, because they are generally smaller and less massive than 
gaseous planets. Therefore, few exoplanets near the size of Earth have had their 
masses measured. Here we report the sizes and masses of three planets orbiting
Kepler-138, a star much fainter and cooler than the Sun. We determine that the
mass of the Mars-sized inner planet, Kepler-138 b, is 0.066(+0.059)(-0.037) Earth
masses. Its density is 2.6(+2.4)(-1.5) grams per cubic centimetre. The middle and
outer planets are both slightly larger than Earth. The middle planet's density
(6.2(+5.8)(-3.4) grams per cubic centimetre) is similar to that of Earth, and the
outer planet is less than half as dense at 2.1(+2.2)(-1.2) grams per cubic
centimetre, implying that it contains a greater portion of low-density components
such as water and hydrogen.

There is an urgent need for new drugs to treat malaria, with broad therapeutic
potential and novel modes of action, to widen the scope of treatment and to
overcome emerging drug resistance. Here we describe the discovery of DDD107498, a
compound with a potent and novel spectrum of antimalarial activity against
multiple life-cycle stages of the Plasmodium parasite, with good pharmacokinetic 
properties and an acceptable safety profile. DDD107498 demonstrates potential to 
address a variety of clinical needs, including single-dose treatment,
transmission blocking and chemoprotection. DDD107498 was developed from a
screening programme against blood-stage malaria parasites; its molecular target
has been identified as translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which is
responsible for the GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome along messenger
RNA, and is essential for protein synthesis. This discovery of eEF2 as a viable
antimalarial drug target opens up new possibilities for drug discovery.

Pacific Ocean western boundary currents and the interlinked equatorial Pacific
circulation system were among the first currents of these types to be explored by
pioneering oceanographers. The widely accepted but poorly quantified importance
of these currents-in processes such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Indonesian Throughflow-has triggered renewed 
interest. Ongoing efforts are seeking to understand the heat and mass balances of
the equatorial Pacific, and possible changes associated with
greenhouse-gas-induced climate change. Only a concerted international effort will
close the observational, theoretical and technical gaps currently limiting a
robust answer to these elusive questions.

Misfolded protein aggregates represent a continuum with overlapping features in
neurodegenerative diseases, but differences in protein components and affected
brain regions. The molecular hallmark of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's
disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy are megadalton
α-synuclein-rich deposits suggestive of one molecular event causing distinct
disease phenotypes. Glial α-synuclein (α-SYN) filamentous deposits are prominent 
in multiple system atrophy and neuronal α-SYN inclusions are found in Parkinson's
disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The discovery of α-SYN assemblies with
different structural characteristics or 'strains' has led to the hypothesis that 
strains could account for the different clinico-pathological traits within
synucleinopathies. In this study we show that α-SYN strain conformation and
seeding propensity lead to distinct histopathological and behavioural phenotypes.
We assess the properties of structurally well-defined α-SYN assemblies
(oligomers, ribbons and fibrils) after injection in rat brain. We prove that
α-SYN strains amplify in vivo. Fibrils seem to be the major toxic strain,
resulting in progressive motor impairment and cell death, whereas ribbons cause a
distinct histopathological phenotype displaying Parkinson's disease and multiple 
system atrophy traits. Additionally, we show that α-SYN assemblies cross the
blood-brain barrier and distribute to the central nervous system after
intravenous injection. Our results demonstrate that distinct α-SYN strains
display differential seeding capacities, inducing strain-specific pathology and
neurotoxic phenotypes.

Spatial working memory, the caching of behaviourally relevant spatial cues on a
timescale of seconds, is a fundamental constituent of cognition. Although the
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are known to contribute jointly to successful
spatial working memory, the anatomical pathway and temporal window for the
interaction of these structures critical to spatial working memory has not yet
been established. Here we find that direct hippocampal-prefrontal afferents are
critical for encoding, but not for maintenance or retrieval, of spatial cues in
mice. These cues are represented by the activity of individual prefrontal units
in a manner that is dependent on hippocampal input only during the cue-encoding
phase of a spatial working memory task. Successful encoding of these cues appears
to be mediated by gamma-frequency synchrony between the two structures. These
findings indicate a critical role for the direct hippocampal-prefrontal afferent 
pathway in the continuous updating of task-related spatial information during
spatial working memory.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest intracellular endomembrane system, 
enabling protein and lipid synthesis, ion homeostasis, quality control of newly
synthesized proteins and organelle communication. Constant ER turnover and
modulation is needed to meet different cellular requirements and autophagy has an
important role in this process. However, its underlying regulatory mechanisms
remain unexplained. Here we show that members of the FAM134 reticulon protein
family are ER-resident receptors that bind to autophagy modifiers LC3 and
GABARAP, and facilitate ER degradation by autophagy ('ER-phagy'). Downregulation 
of FAM134B protein in human cells causes an expansion of the ER, while FAM134B
overexpression results in ER fragmentation and lysosomal degradation. Mutant
FAM134B proteins that cause sensory neuropathy in humans are unable to act as
ER-phagy receptors. Consistently, disruption of Fam134b in mice causes expansion 
of the ER, inhibits ER turnover, sensitizes cells to stress-induced apoptotic
cell death and leads to degeneration of sensory neurons. Therefore, selective
ER-phagy via FAM134 proteins is indispensable for mammalian cell homeostasis and 
controls ER morphology and turnover in mice and humans.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) degrades various
intracellular constituents to regulate a wide range of cellular functions, and is
also closely linked to several human diseases. In selective autophagy, receptor
proteins recognize degradation targets and direct their sequestration by
double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which transport them into
lysosomes or vacuoles. Although recent studies have shown that selective
autophagy is involved in quality/quantity control of some organelles, including
mitochondria and peroxisomes, it remains unclear how extensively it contributes
to cellular organelle homeostasis. Here we describe selective autophagy of the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nucleus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We 
identify two novel proteins, Atg39 and Atg40, as receptors specific to these
pathways. Atg39 localizes to the perinuclear ER (or the nuclear envelope) and
induces autophagic sequestration of part of the nucleus. Atg40 is enriched in the
cortical and cytoplasmic ER, and loads these ER subdomains into autophagosomes.
Atg39-dependent autophagy of the perinuclear ER/nucleus is required for cell
survival under nitrogen-deprivation conditions. Atg40 is probably the functional 
counterpart of FAM134B, an autophagy receptor for the ER in mammals that has been
implicated in sensory neuropathy. Our results provide fundamental insight into
the pathophysiological roles and mechanisms of 'ER-phagy' and 'nucleophagy' in
other organisms.

Mutations or amplification of the MET proto-oncogene are involved in the
pathogenesis of several tumours, which rely on the constitutive engagement of
this pathway for their growth and survival. However, MET is expressed not only by
cancer cells but also by tumour-associated stromal cells, although its precise
role in this compartment is not well characterized. Here we show that MET is
required for neutrophil chemoattraction and cytotoxicity in response to its
ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Met deletion in mouse neutrophils enhances
tumour growth and metastasis. This phenotype correlates with reduced neutrophil
infiltration to both the primary tumour and metastatic sites. Similarly, Met is
necessary for neutrophil transudation during colitis, skin rash or peritonitis.
Mechanistically, Met is induced by tumour-derived tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
or other inflammatory stimuli in both mouse and human neutrophils. This induction
is instrumental for neutrophil transmigration across an activated endothelium and
for inducible nitric oxide synthase production upon HGF stimulation.
Consequently, HGF/MET-dependent nitric oxide release by neutrophils promotes
cancer cell killing, which abates tumour growth and metastasis. After systemic
administration of a MET kinase inhibitor, we prove that the therapeutic benefit
of MET targeting in cancer cells is partly countered by the pro-tumoural effect
arising from MET blockade in neutrophils. Our work identifies an unprecedented
role of MET in neutrophils, suggests a potential 'Achilles' heel' of MET-targeted
therapies in cancer, and supports the rationale for evaluating anti-MET drugs in 
certain inflammatory diseases.

Knowledge of the structure and dynamics of RNA molecules is critical to
understanding their many biological functions. Furthermore, synthetic RNAs have
applications as therapeutics and molecular sensors. Both research and
technological applications of RNA would be dramatically enhanced by methods that 
enable incorporation of modified or labelled nucleotides into specifically
designated positions or regions of RNA. However, the synthesis of tens of
milligrams of such RNAs using existing methods has been impossible. Here we
develop a hybrid solid-liquid phase transcription method and automated robotic
platform for the synthesis of RNAs with position-selective labelling. We
demonstrate its use by successfully preparing various isotope- or fluorescently
labelled versions of the 71-nucleotide aptamer domain of an adenine riboswitch
for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or single-molecule Förster resonance 
energy transfer, respectively. Those RNAs include molecules that were selectively
isotope-labelled in specific loops, linkers, a helix, several discrete positions,
or a single internal position, as well as RNA molecules that were fluorescently
labelled in and near kissing loops. These selectively labelled RNAs have the same
fold as those transcribed using conventional methods, but they greatly simplify
the interpretation of NMR spectra. The single-position isotope- and fluorescently
labelled RNA samples reveal multiple conformational states of the adenine
riboswitch. Lastly, we describe a robotic platform and the operation that
automates this technology. Our selective labelling method may be useful for
studying RNA structure and dynamics and for making RNA sensors for a variety of
applications including cell-biological studies, substance detection, and disease 
diagnostics.

Theropod dinosaurs were the dominant predators in most Mesozoic era terrestrial
ecosystems. Early theropod evolution is currently interpreted as the
diversification of various carnivorous and cursorial taxa, whereas the
acquisition of herbivorism, together with the secondary loss of cursorial
adaptations, occurred much later among advanced coelurosaurian theropods. A new, 
bizarre herbivorous basal tetanuran from the Upper Jurassic of Chile challenges
this conception. The new dinosaur was discovered at Aysén, a fossil locality in
the Upper Jurassic Toqui Formation of southern Chile (General Carrera Lake). The 
site yielded abundant and exquisitely preserved three-dimensional skeletons of
small archosaurs. Several articulated individuals of Chilesaurus at different
ontogenetic stages have been collected, as well as less abundant basal
crocodyliforms, and fragmentary remains of sauropod dinosaurs (diplodocids and
titanosaurians).

About half of human genes use alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (ApA) to
generate messenger RNA transcripts that differ in the length of their 3'
untranslated regions (3' UTRs) while producing the same protein. Here we show in 
human cell lines that alternative 3' UTRs differentially regulate the
localization of membrane proteins. The long 3' UTR of CD47 enables efficient cell
surface expression of CD47 protein, whereas the short 3' UTR primarily localizes 
CD47 protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. CD47 protein localization occurs
post-translationally and independently of RNA localization. In our model of 3'
UTR-dependent protein localization, the long 3' UTR of CD47 acts as a scaffold to
recruit a protein complex containing the RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as
ELAVL1) and SET to the site of translation. This facilitates interaction of SET
with the newly translated cytoplasmic domains of CD47 and results in subsequent
translocation of CD47 to the plasma membrane via activated RAC1 (ref. 5). We also
show that CD47 protein has different functions depending on whether it was
generated by the short or long 3' UTR isoforms. Thus, ApA contributes to the
functional diversity of the proteome without changing the amino acid sequence. 3'
UTR-dependent protein localization has the potential to be a widespread
trafficking mechanism for membrane proteins because HuR binds to thousands of
mRNAs, and we show that the long 3' UTRs of CD44, ITGA1 and TNFRSF13C, which are 
bound by HuR, increase surface protein expression compared to their corresponding
short 3' UTRs. We propose that during translation the scaffold function of 3'
UTRs facilitates binding of proteins to nascent proteins to direct their
transport or function--and this role of 3' UTRs can be regulated by ApA.

Metastatic disease remains the primary cause of death for patients with breast
cancer. The different steps of the metastatic cascade rely on reciprocal
interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment. Within this local
microenvironment and in distant organs, immune cells and their mediators are
known to facilitate metastasis formation. However, the precise contribution of
tumour-induced systemic inflammation to metastasis and the mechanisms regulating 
systemic inflammation are poorly understood. Here we show that tumours maximize
their chance of metastasizing by evoking a systemic inflammatory cascade in mouse
models of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis. We mechanistically demonstrate
that interleukin (IL)-1β elicits IL-17 expression from gamma delta (γδ) T cells, 
resulting in systemic, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-dependent
expansion and polarization of neutrophils in mice bearing mammary tumours.
Tumour-induced neutrophils acquire the ability to suppress cytotoxic T
lymphocytes carrying the CD8 antigen, which limit the establishment of
metastases. Neutralization of IL-17 or G-CSF and absence of γδ T cells prevents
neutrophil accumulation and downregulates the T-cell-suppressive phenotype of
neutrophils. Moreover, the absence of γδ T cells or neutrophils profoundly
reduces pulmonary and lymph node metastases without influencing primary tumour
progression. Our data indicate that targeting this novel cancer-cell-initiated
domino effect within the immune system--the γδ T cell/IL-17/neutrophil
axis--represents a new strategy to inhibit metastatic disease.

The relative motion of lithospheric plates and underlying mantle produces
localized deformation near the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. The transition
from rheologically stronger lithosphere to weaker asthenosphere may result from a
small amount of melt or water in the asthenosphere, reducing viscosity. Either
possibility may explain the seismic and electrical anomalies that extend to a
depth of about 200 kilometres. However, the effect of melt on the physical
properties of deformed materials at upper-mantle conditions remains poorly
constrained. Here we present electrical anisotropy measurements at high
temperatures and quasi-hydrostatic pressures of about three gigapascals on
previously deformed olivine aggregates and sheared partially molten rocks. For
all samples, electrical conductivity is highest when parallel to the direction of
prior deformation. The conductivity of highly sheared olivine samples is ten
times greater in the shear direction than for undeformed samples. At temperatures
above 900 degrees Celsius, a deformed solid matrix with nearly isotropic melt
distribution has an electrical anisotropy factor less than five. To obtain higher
electrical anisotropy (up to a factor of 100), we propose an experimentally based
model in which layers of sheared olivine are alternated with layers of sheared
olivine plus MORB or of pure melt. Conductivities are up to 100 times greater in 
the shear direction than when perpendicular to the shear direction and reproduce 
stress-driven alignment of the melt. Our experimental results and the model
reproduce mantle conductivity-depth profiles for melt-bearing geological
contexts. The field data are best fitted by an electrically anisotropic
asthenosphere overlain by an isotropic, high-conductivity lowermost lithosphere. 
The high conductivity could arise from partial melting associated with localized 
deformation resulting from differential plate velocities relative to the mantle, 
with subsequent upward melt percolation from the asthenosphere.

Our current understanding of ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere interactions at ice-age 
terminations relies largely on assessments of the most recent (last)
glacial-interglacial transition, Termination I (T-I). But the extent to which T-I
is representative of previous terminations remains unclear. Testing the
consistency of termination processes requires comparison of time series of
critical climate parameters with detailed absolute and relative age control.
However, such age control has been lacking for even the penultimate glacial
termination (T-II), which culminated in a sea-level highstand during the last
interglacial period that was several metres above present. Here we show that
Heinrich Stadial 11 (HS11), a prominent North Atlantic cold episode, occurred
between 135 ± 1 and 130 ± 2 thousand years ago and was linked with rapid
sea-level rise during T-II. Our conclusions are based on new and existing data
for T-II and the last interglacial that we collate onto a single, radiometrically
constrained chronology. The HS11 cold episode punctuated T-II and coincided
directly with a major deglacial meltwater pulse, which predominantly entered the 
North Atlantic Ocean and accounted for about 70 per cent of the
glacial-interglacial sea-level rise. We conclude that, possibly in response to
stronger insolation and CO2 forcing earlier in T-II, the relationship between
climate and ice-volume changes differed fundamentally from that of T-I. In T-I,
the major sea-level rise clearly post-dates Heinrich Stadial 1. We also find that
HS11 coincided with sustained Antarctic warming, probably through a bipolar
seesaw temperature response, and propose that this heat gain at high southern
latitudes promoted Antarctic ice-sheet melting that fuelled the last interglacial
sea-level peak.

Metamaterials are artificial optical media composed of sub-wavelength metallic
and dielectric building blocks that feature optical phenomena not present in
naturally occurring materials. Although they can serve as the basis for unique
optical devices that mould the flow of light in unconventional ways,
three-dimensional metamaterials suffer from extreme propagation losses.
Two-dimensional metamaterials (metasurfaces) such as hyperbolic metasurfaces for 
propagating surface plasmon polaritons have the potential to alleviate this
problem. Because the surface plasmon polaritons are guided at a metal-dielectric 
interface (rather than passing through metallic components), these hyperbolic
metasurfaces have been predicted to suffer much lower propagation loss while
still exhibiting optical phenomena akin to those in three-dimensional
metamaterials. Moreover, because of their planar nature, these devices enable the
construction of integrated metamaterial circuits as well as easy coupling with
other optoelectronic elements. Here we report the experimental realization of a
visible-frequency hyperbolic metasurface using single-crystal silver
nanostructures defined by lithographic and etching techniques. The resulting
devices display the characteristic properties of metamaterials, such as negative 
refraction and diffraction-free propagation, with device performance greatly
exceeding those of previous demonstrations. Moreover, hyperbolic metasurfaces
exhibit strong, dispersion-dependent spin-orbit coupling, enabling polarization- 
and wavelength-dependent routeing of surface plasmon polaritons and
two-dimensional chiral optical components. These results open the door to
realizing integrated optical meta-circuits, with wide-ranging applications in
areas from imaging and sensing to quantum optics and quantum information science.

The long-standing problem of how the solar atmosphere is heated has been
addressed by many theoretical studies, which have stressed the relevance of two
specific mechanisms, involving magnetic reconnection and waves, as well as the
necessity of treating the chromosphere and corona together. But a fully
consistent model has not yet been constructed and debate continues, in particular
about the possibility of coronal plasma being heated by energetic phenomena
observed in the chromosphere. Here we report modelling of the heating of the
quiet Sun, in which magnetic fields are generated by a subphotospheric fluid
dynamo intrinsically connected to granulation. We find that the fields expand
into the chromosphere, where plasma is heated at the rate required to match
observations (4,500 watts per square metre) by small-scale eruptions that release
magnetic energy and drive sonic motions. Some energetic eruptions can even reach 
heights of 10 million metres above the surface of the Sun, thereby affecting the 
very low corona. Extending the model by also taking into account the vertical
weak network magnetic field allows for the existence of a mechanism able to heat 
the corona above, while leaving unchanged the physics of chromospheric eruptions.
Such a mechanism rests on the eventual dissipation of Alfvén waves generated
inside the chromosphere and that carry upwards the required energy flux of 300
watts per square metre. The model shows a topologically complex magnetic field of
160 gauss on the Sun's surface, agreeing with inferences obtained from
spectropolarimetric observations, chromospheric features (contributing only
weakly to the coronal heating) that can be identified with observed spicules and 
blinkers, and vortices that may be possibly associated with observed solar
tornadoes.

Saturn's faint outermost ring, discovered in 2009 (ref. 1), is probably formed by
particles ejected from the distant moon Phoebe. The ring was detected between
distances of 128 and 207 Saturn radii (RS = 60,330 kilometres) from the planet,
with a full vertical extent of 40RS, making it well over ten times larger than
Saturn's hitherto largest known ring, the E ring. The total radial extent of the 
Phoebe ring could not, however, be determined at that time, nor could particle
sizes be significantly constrained. Here we report infrared imaging of the entire
ring, which extends from 100RS out to a surprisingly distant 270RS. We model the 
orbital dynamics of ring particles launched from Phoebe, and construct
theoretical power-law profiles of the particle size distribution. We find that
very steep profiles fit the data best, and that elevated grain temperatures,
arising because of the radiative inefficiency of the smallest grains, probably
contribute to the steepness. By converting our constraint on particle sizes into 
a form that is independent of the uncertain size distribution, we determine that 
particles with radii greater than ten centimetres, whose orbits do not decay
appreciably inward over 4.5 billion years, contribute at most about ten per cent 
to the cross-sectional area of the ring's dusty component.

The Bronze Age of Eurasia (around 3000-1000 BC) was a period of major cultural
changes. However, there is debate about whether these changes resulted from the
circulation of ideas or from human migrations, potentially also facilitating the 
spread of languages and certain phenotypic traits. We investigated this by using 
new, improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans
from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period
involving large-scale population migrations and replacements, responsible for
shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia.
Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized spread of Indo-European
languages during the Early Bronze Age. We also demonstrate that light skin
pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency in the Bronze
Age, but not lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive
selection on lactose tolerance than previously thought.

Stem cells of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver and other columnar
epithelia collectively resist cloning in their elemental states. Here we
demonstrate the cloning and propagation of highly clonogenic, 'ground state' stem
cells of the human intestine and colon. We show that derived stem-cell pedigrees 
sustain limited copy number and sequence variation despite extensive serial
passaging and display exquisitely precise, cell-autonomous commitment to
epithelial differentiation consistent with their origins along the intestinal
tract. This developmentally patterned and epigenetically maintained commitment of
stem cells is likely to enforce the functional specificity of the adult
intestinal tract. Using clonally derived colonic epithelia, we show that toxins A
or B of the enteric pathogen Clostridium difficile recapitulate the salient
features of pseudomembranous colitis. The stability of the epigenetic commitment 
programs of these stem cells, coupled with their unlimited replicative expansion 
and maintained clonogenicity, suggests certain advantages for their use in
disease modelling and regenerative medicine.

During telophase, the nuclear envelope (NE) reforms around daughter nuclei to
ensure proper segregation of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents. NE reformation
requires the coating of chromatin by membrane derived from the endoplasmic
reticulum, and a subsequent annular fusion step to ensure that the formed
envelope is sealed. How annular fusion is accomplished is unknown, but it is
thought to involve the p97 AAA-ATPase complex and bears a topological equivalence
to the membrane fusion event that occurs during the abscission phase of
cytokinesis. Here we show that the endosomal sorting complex required for
transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery localizes to sites of annular fusion in the
forming NE in human cells, and is necessary for proper post-mitotic
nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization. The ESCRT-III component charged
multivesicular body protein 2A (CHMP2A) is directed to the forming NE through
binding to CHMP4B, and provides an activity essential for NE reformation.
Localization also requires the p97 complex member ubiquitin fusion and
degradation 1 (UFD1). Our results describe a novel role for the ESCRT machinery
in cell division and demonstrate a conservation of the machineries involved in
topologically equivalent mitotic membrane remodelling events.

At the onset of metazoan cell division the nuclear envelope breaks down to enable
capture of chromosomes by the microtubule-containing spindle apparatus. During
anaphase, when chromosomes have separated, the nuclear envelope is reassembled
around the forming daughter nuclei. How the nuclear envelope is sealed, and how
this is coordinated with spindle disassembly, is largely unknown. Here we show
that endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III, previously
found to promote membrane constriction and sealing during receptor sorting, virus
budding, cytokinesis and plasma membrane repair, is transiently recruited to the 
reassembling nuclear envelope during late anaphase. ESCRT-III and its regulatory 
AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase VPS4 are
specifically recruited by the ESCRT-III-like protein CHMP7 to sites where the
reforming nuclear envelope engulfs spindle microtubules. Subsequent association
of another ESCRT-III-like protein, IST1, directly recruits the AAA ATPase spastin
to sever microtubules. Disrupting spastin function impairs spindle disassembly
and results in extended localization of ESCRT-III at the nuclear envelope.
Interference with ESCRT-III functions in anaphase is accompanied by delayed
microtubule disassembly, compromised nuclear integrity and the appearance of DNA 
damage foci in subsequent interphase. We propose that ESCRT-III, VPS4 and spastin
cooperate to coordinate nuclear envelope sealing and spindle disassembly at
nuclear envelope-microtubule intersection sites during mitotic exit to ensure
nuclear integrity and genome safeguarding, with a striking mechanistic parallel
to cytokinetic abscission.

Genome sequencing has uncovered a new mutational phenomenon in cancer and
congenital disorders called chromothripsis. Chromothripsis is characterized by
extensive genomic rearrangements and an oscillating pattern of DNA copy number
levels, all curiously restricted to one or a few chromosomes. The mechanism for
chromothripsis is unknown, but we previously proposed that it could occur through
the physical isolation of chromosomes in aberrant nuclear structures called
micronuclei. Here, using a combination of live cell imaging and single-cell
genome sequencing, we demonstrate that micronucleus formation can indeed generate
a spectrum of genomic rearrangements, some of which recapitulate all known
features of chromothripsis. These events are restricted to the mis-segregated
chromosome and occur within one cell division. We demonstrate that the mechanism 
for chromothripsis can involve the fragmentation and subsequent reassembly of a
single chromatid from a micronucleus. Collectively, these experiments establish a
new mutational process of which chromothripsis is one extreme outcome.

In response to cardiac damage, a mesothelial tissue layer enveloping the heart
called the epicardium is activated to proliferate and accumulate at the injury
site. Recent studies have implicated the epicardium in multiple aspects of
cardiac repair: as a source of paracrine signals for cardiomyocyte survival or
proliferation; a supply of perivascular cells and possibly other cell types such 
as cardiomyocytes; and as a mediator of inflammation. However, the biology and
dynamism of the adult epicardium is poorly understood. To investigate this, we
created a transgenic line to ablate the epicardial cell population in adult
zebrafish. Here we find that genetic depletion of the epicardium after myocardial
loss inhibits cardiomyocyte proliferation and delays muscle regeneration. The
epicardium vigorously regenerates after its ablation, through proliferation and
migration of spared epicardial cells as a sheet to cover the exposed ventricular 
surface in a wave from the chamber base towards its apex. By reconstituting
epicardial regeneration ex vivo, we show that extirpation of the bulbous
arteriosus-a distinct, smooth-muscle-rich tissue structure that distributes
outflow from the ventricle-prevents epicardial regeneration. Conversely,
experimental repositioning of the bulbous arteriosus by tissue recombination
initiates epicardial regeneration and can govern its direction. Hedgehog (Hh)
ligand is expressed in the bulbous arteriosus, and treatment with a Hh signalling
antagonist arrests epicardial regeneration and blunts the epicardial response to 
muscle injury. Transplantation of Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-soaked beads at the
ventricular base stimulates epicardial regeneration after bulbous arteriosus
removal, indicating that Hh signalling can substitute for the influence of the
outflow tract. Thus, the ventricular epicardium has pronounced regenerative
capacity, regulated by the neighbouring cardiac outflow tract and Hh signalling. 
These findings extend our understanding of tissue interactions during
regeneration and have implications for mobilizing epicardial cells for
therapeutic heart repair.

Transposable elements comprise roughly 40% of mammalian genomes. They have an
active role in genetic variation, adaptation and evolution through the
duplication or deletion of genes or their regulatory elements, and transposable
elements themselves can act as alternative promoters for nearby genes, resulting 
in non-canonical regulation of transcription. However, transposable element
activity can lead to detrimental genome instability, and hosts have evolved
mechanisms to silence transposable element mobility appropriately. Recent studies
have demonstrated that a subset of transposable elements, endogenous retroviral
elements (ERVs) containing long terminal repeats (LTRs), are silenced through
trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) by ESET (also known as SETDB1 
or KMT1E) and a co-repressor complex containing KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1; 
also known as TRIM28) in mouse embryonic stem cells. Here we show that the
replacement histone variant H3.3 is enriched at class I and class II ERVs,
notably those of the early transposon (ETn)/MusD family and intracisternal A-type
particles (IAPs). Deposition at a subset of these elements is dependent upon the 
H3.3 chaperone complex containing α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome
X-linked (ATRX) and death-domain-associated protein (DAXX). We demonstrate that
recruitment of DAXX, H3.3 and KAP1 to ERVs is co-dependent and occurs upstream of
ESET, linking H3.3 to ERV-associated H3K9me3. Importantly, H3K9me3 is reduced at 
ERVs upon H3.3 deletion, resulting in derepression and dysregulation of adjacent,
endogenous genes, along with increased retrotransposition of IAPs. Our study
identifies a unique heterochromatin state marked by the presence of both H3.3 and
H3K9me3, and establishes an important role for H3.3 in control of ERV
retrotransposition in embryonic stem cells.

Multiple sclerosis involves an aberrant autoimmune response and progressive
failure of remyelination in the central nervous system. Prevention of neural
degeneration and subsequent disability requires remyelination through the
generation of new oligodendrocytes, but current treatments exclusively target the
immune system. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are stem cells in the central
nervous system and the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes. These
cells are abundant in demyelinated regions of patients with multiple sclerosis,
yet fail to differentiate, thereby representing a cellular target for
pharmacological intervention. To discover therapeutic compounds for enhancing
myelination from endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we screened a
library of bioactive small molecules on mouse pluripotent epiblast
stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Here we show seven drugs
function at nanomolar doses selectively to enhance the generation of mature
oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells in vitro. Two drugs, miconazole and
clobetasol, are effective in promoting precocious myelination in organotypic
cerebellar slice cultures, and in vivo in early postnatal mouse pups. Systemic
delivery of each of the two drugs significantly increases the number of new
oligodendrocytes and enhances remyelination in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model
of focal demyelination. Administering each of the two drugs at the peak of
disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of chronic
progressive multiple sclerosis results in striking reversal of disease severity. 
Immune response assays show that miconazole functions directly as a remyelinating
drug with no effect on the immune system, whereas clobetasol is a potent
immunosuppressant as well as a remyelinating agent. Mechanistic studies show that
miconazole and clobetasol function in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through
mitogen-activated protein kinase and glucocorticoid receptor signalling,
respectively. Furthermore, both drugs enhance the generation of human
oligodendrocytes from human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro.
Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and
clobetasol, or structurally modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in
patients.

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections, and
comprise nearly 8% of the human genome. The most recently acquired human ERV is
HERVK(HML-2), which repeatedly infected the primate lineage both before and after
the divergence of the human and chimpanzee common ancestor. Unlike most other
human ERVs, HERVK retained multiple copies of intact open reading frames encoding
retroviral proteins. However, HERVK is transcriptionally silenced by the host,
with the exception of in certain pathological contexts such as germ-cell tumours,
melanoma or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Here we demonstrate
that DNA hypomethylation at long terminal repeat elements representing the most
recent genomic integrations, together with transactivation by OCT4 (also known as
POU5F1), synergistically facilitate HERVK expression. Consequently, HERVK is
transcribed during normal human embryogenesis, beginning with embryonic genome
activation at the eight-cell stage, continuing through the emergence of epiblast 
cells in preimplantation blastocysts, and ceasing during human embryonic stem
cell derivation from blastocyst outgrowths. Remarkably, we detected HERVK
viral-like particles and Gag proteins in human blastocysts, indicating that early
human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral products. We further
show that overexpression of one such product, the HERVK accessory protein Rec, in
a pluripotent cell line is sufficient to increase IFITM1 levels on the cell
surface and inhibit viral infection, suggesting at least one mechanism through
which HERVK can induce viral restriction pathways in early embryonic cells.
Moreover, Rec directly binds a subset of cellular RNAs and modulates their
ribosome occupancy, indicating that complex interactions between retroviral
proteins and host factors can fine-tune pathways of early human development.

With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very
well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly
replaced by power input from an exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce
metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require 
an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and
would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show
that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle
exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the
user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic 
energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a
spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the 
ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon.
Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton
consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical
work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 ± 2.6% for healthy human
users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices.
Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the structure
of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong
natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in
efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly
simple behaviour.

We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000
years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost 400,000
polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required
for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us 
to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies and to
obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and
Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. 
At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ∼8,000-7,000 years ago,
closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain,
different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a
distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a
∼24,000-year-old Siberian. By ∼6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of 
Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, 
the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the
preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near
Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ∼4,500 years ago, 
as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ∼75% of their
ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of
Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled 
central Europeans until at least ∼3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in
present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin of at
least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.

The standard model of particle physics describes the fundamental particles and
their interactions via the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces. It provides
precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. 
The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson (B(s)(0)) and
the B0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (μ+ and μ−) are
especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the
standard model. The standard model predicts that the B(s)(0) →µ+µ− and B(0) →µ+µ−
decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion
mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B0 mesons.
A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions 
of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model
should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN started
operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the 
branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model
predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb (Large Hadron Collider
beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from
proton–proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy
of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts. Here we report
the first observation of the B(s)(0) → µ+µ− decay, with a statistical
significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement so far
of its branching fraction. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the B(0) → µ+µ− 
decay with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. Both
measurements are statistically compatible with standard model predictions and
allow stringent constraints to be placed on theories beyond the standard model.
The LHC experiments will resume taking data in 2015, recording proton–proton
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts, which will
approximately double the production rates of B(s)(0) and B0 mesons and lead to
further improvements in the precision of these crucial tests of the standard
model.

Water-driven fracture propagation beneath supraglacial lakes rapidly transports
large volumes of surface meltwater to the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet. These 
drainage events drive transient ice-sheet acceleration and establish conduits for
additional surface-to-bed meltwater transport for the remainder of the melt
season. Although it is well established that cracks must remain water-filled to
propagate to the bed, the precise mechanisms that initiate hydro-fracture events 
beneath lakes are unknown. Here we show that, for a lake on the western Greenland
Ice Sheet, drainage events are preceded by a 6-12 hour period of ice-sheet uplift
and/or enhanced basal slip. Our observations from a dense Global Positioning
System (GPS) network allow us to determine the distribution of meltwater at the
ice-sheet bed before, during, and after three rapid drainages in 2011-2013, each 
of which generates tensile stresses that promote hydro-fracture beneath the lake.
We hypothesize that these precursors are associated with the introduction of
meltwater to the bed through neighbouring moulin systems (vertical conduits
connecting the surface and base of the ice sheet). Our results imply that as
lakes form in less crevassed, interior regions of the ice sheet, where water at
the bed is currently less pervasive, the creation of new surface-to-bed conduits 
caused by lake-draining hydro-fractures may be limited.

Four small moons--Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra--follow near-circular,
near-equatorial orbits around the central 'binary planet' comprising Pluto and
its large moon, Charon. New observational details of the system have emerged
following the discoveries of Kerberos and Styx. Here we report that Styx, Nix and
Hydra are tied together by a three-body resonance, which is reminiscent of the
Laplace resonance linking Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. Perturbations 
by the other bodies, however, inject chaos into this otherwise stable
configuration. Nix and Hydra have bright surfaces similar to that of Charon.
Kerberos may be much darker, raising questions about how a heterogeneous
satellite system might have formed. Nix and Hydra rotate chaotically, driven by
the large torques of the Pluto-Charon binary.

Tumour metastasis is a complex process involving reciprocal interplay between
cancer cells and host stroma at both primary and secondary sites, and is strongly
influenced by microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia. Tumour-secreted
proteins play a crucial role in these interactions and present strategic
therapeutic potential. Metastasis of breast cancer to the bone affects
approximately 85% of patients with advanced disease and renders them largely
untreatable. Specifically, osteolytic bone lesions, where bone is destroyed, lead
to debilitating skeletal complications and increased patient morbidity and
mortality. The molecular interactions governing the early events of osteolytic
lesion formation are currently unclear. Here we show hypoxia to be specifically
associated with bone relapse in patients with oestrogen-receptor negative breast 
cancer. Global quantitative analysis of the hypoxic secretome identified lysyl
oxidase (LOX) as significantly associated with bone-tropism and relapse. High
expression of LOX in primary breast tumours or systemic delivery of LOX leads to 
osteolytic lesion formation whereas silencing or inhibition of LOX activity
abrogates tumour-driven osteolytic lesion formation. We identify LOX as a novel
regulator of NFATc1-driven osteoclastogenesis, independent of RANK ligand, which 
disrupts normal bone homeostasis leading to the formation of focal pre-metastatic
lesions. We show that these lesions subsequently provide a platform for
circulating tumour cells to colonize and form bone metastases. Our study
identifies a novel mechanism of regulation of bone homeostasis and metastasis,
opening up opportunities for novel therapeutic intervention with important
clinical implications.

Spatial navigation requires information about the relationship between current
and future positions. The activity of hippocampal neurons appears to reflect such
a relationship, representing not only instantaneous position but also the path
towards a goal location. However, how the hippocampus obtains information about
goal direction is poorly understood. Here we report a prefrontal-thalamic neural 
circuit that is required for hippocampal representation of routes or trajectories
through the environment. Trajectory-dependent firing was observed in medial
prefrontal cortex, the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus, and the CA1 region of
the hippocampus in rats. Lesioning or optogenetic silencing of the nucleus
reuniens substantially reduced trajectory-dependent CA1 firing.
Trajectory-dependent activity was almost absent in CA3, which does not receive
nucleus reuniens input. The data suggest that projections from medial prefrontal 
cortex, via the nucleus reuniens, are crucial for representation of the future
path during goal-directed behaviour and point to the thalamus as a key node in
networks for long-range communication between cortical regions involved in
navigation.

Interactions between primary producers and bacteria impact the physiology of both
partners, alter the chemistry of their environment, and shape ecosystem
diversity. In marine ecosystems, these interactions are difficult to study partly
because the major photosynthetic organisms are microscopic, unicellular
phytoplankton. Coastal phytoplankton communities are dominated by diatoms, which 
generate approximately 40% of marine primary production and form the base of many
marine food webs. Diatoms co-occur with specific bacterial taxa, but the
mechanisms of potential interactions are mostly unknown. Here we tease apart a
bacterial consortium associated with a globally distributed diatom and find that 
a Sulfitobacter species promotes diatom cell division via secretion of the
hormone indole-3-acetic acid, synthesized by the bacterium using both
diatom-secreted and endogenous tryptophan. Indole-3-acetic acid and tryptophan
serve as signalling molecules that are part of a complex exchange of nutrients,
including diatom-excreted organosulfur molecules and bacterial-excreted ammonia. 
The potential prevalence of this mode of signalling in the oceans is corroborated
by metabolite and metatranscriptome analyses that show widespread indole-3-acetic
acid production by Sulfitobacter-related bacteria, particularly in coastal
environments. Our study expands on the emerging recognition that marine microbial
communities are part of tightly connected networks by providing evidence that
these interactions are mediated through production and exchange of infochemicals.

How cells acquire their fate is a fundamental question in developmental and
regenerative biology. Multipotent progenitors undergo cell-fate restriction in
response to cues from the microenvironment, the nature of which is poorly
understood. In the case of the lymphatic system, venous cells from the cardinal
vein are thought to generate lymphatic vessels through trans-differentiation.
Here we show that in zebrafish, lymphatic progenitors arise from a previously
uncharacterized niche of specialized angioblasts within the cardinal vein, which 
also generates arterial and venous fates. We further identify Wnt5b as a novel
lymphatic inductive signal and show that it also promotes the
‘angioblast-to-lymphatic’ transition in human embryonic stem cells, suggesting
that this process is evolutionarily conserved. Our results uncover a novel
mechanism of lymphatic specification, and provide the first characterization of
the lymphatic inductive niche. More broadly, our findings highlight the cardinal 
vein as a heterogeneous structure, analogous to the haematopoietic niche in the
aortic floor.

The lymphatic vasculature is a blind-ended network crucial for tissue-fluid
homeostasis, immune surveillance and lipid absorption from the gut. Recent
evidence has proposed an entirely venous-derived mammalian lymphatic system. By
contrast, here we show that cardiac lymphatic vessels in mice have a
heterogeneous cellular origin, whereby formation of at least part of the cardiac 
lymphatic network is independent of sprouting from veins. Multiple Cre–lox-based 
lineage tracing revealed a potential contribution from the putative haemogenic
endothelium during development, and discrete lymphatic endothelial progenitor
populations were confirmed by conditional knockout of Prox1 in Tie2+ and Vav1+
compartments. In the adult heart, myocardial infarction promoted a significant
lymphangiogenic response, which was augmented by treatment with VEGF-C, resulting
in improved cardiac function. These data prompt the re-evaluation of a
century-long debate on the origin of lymphatic vessels and suggest that
lymphangiogenesis may represent a therapeutic target to promote cardiac repair
following injury.

Tissue homeostasis is achieved through a balance of cell production (growth) and 
elimination (regression). In contrast to tissue growth, the cells and molecular
signals required for tissue regression remain unknown. To investigate
physiological tissue regression, we use the mouse hair follicle, which cycles
stereotypically between phases of growth and regression while maintaining a pool 
of stem cells to perpetuate tissue regeneration. Here we show by intravital
microscopy in live mice that the regression phase eliminates the majority of the 
epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms: terminal differentiation of
suprabasal cells and a spatial gradient of apoptosis of basal cells. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to
clear dying epithelial neighbours. Through cellular and genetic ablation we show 
that epithelial cell death is extrinsically induced through transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β activation and mesenchymal crosstalk. Strikingly, our data show
that regression acts to reduce the stem cell pool, as inhibition of regression
results in excess basal epithelial cells with regenerative abilities. This study 
identifies the cellular behaviours and molecular mechanisms of regression that
counterbalance growth to maintain tissue homeostasis.

Regulation of protein synthesis is fundamental for all aspects of eukaryotic
biology by controlling development, homeostasis and stress responses. The
13-subunit, 800-kilodalton eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) organizes
initiation factor and ribosome interactions required for productive translation. 
However, current understanding of eIF3 function does not explain genetic evidence
correlating eIF3 deregulation with tissue-specific cancers and developmental
defects. Here we report the genome-wide discovery of human transcripts that
interact with eIF3 using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking
and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP). eIF3 binds to a highly specific program of
messenger RNAs involved in cell growth control processes, including cell cycling,
differentiation and apoptosis, via the mRNA 5' untranslated region. Surprisingly,
functional analysis of the interaction between eIF3 and two mRNAs encoding the
cell proliferation regulators c-JUN and BTG1 reveals that eIF3 uses different
modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or
repression. Our findings illuminate a new role for eIF3 in governing a
specialized repertoire of gene expression and suggest that binding of eIF3 to
specific mRNAs could be targeted to control carcinogenesis.

The cave infills at Sterkfontein contain one of the richest assemblages of
Australopithecus fossils in the world, including the nearly complete skeleton StW
573 ('Little Foot') in its lower section, as well as early stone tools in higher 
sections. However, the chronology of the site remains controversial owing to the 
complex history of cave infilling. Much of the existing chronology based on
uranium-lead dating and palaeomagnetic stratigraphy has recently been called into
question by the recognition that dated flowstones fill cavities formed within
previously cemented breccias and therefore do not form a stratigraphic sequence. 
Earlier dating with cosmogenic nuclides suffered a high degree of uncertainty and
has been questioned on grounds of sediment reworking. Here we use isochron burial
dating with cosmogenic aluminium-26 and beryllium-10 to show that the breccia
containing StW 573 did not undergo significant reworking, and that it was
deposited 3.67 ± 0.16 million years ago, far earlier than the 2.2 million year
flowstones found within it. The skeleton is thus coeval with early
Australopithecus afarensis in eastern Africa. We also date the earliest stone
tools at Sterkfontein to 2.18 ± 0.21 million years ago, placing them in the
Oldowan at a time similar to that found elsewhere in South Africa at Swartkans
and Wonderwerk.

No large group of recently extinct placental mammals remains as evolutionarily
cryptic as the approximately 280 genera grouped as 'South American native
ungulates'. To Charles Darwin, who first collected their remains, they included
perhaps the 'strangest animal[s] ever discovered'. Today, much like 180 years
ago, it is no clearer whether they had one origin or several, arose before or
after the Cretaceous/Palaeogene transition 66.2 million years ago, or are more
likely to belong with the elephants and sirenians of superorder Afrotheria than
with the euungulates (cattle, horses, and allies) of superorder Laurasiatheria.
Morphology-based analyses have proved unconvincing because convergences are
pervasive among unrelated ungulate-like placentals. Approaches using ancient DNA 
have also been unsuccessful, probably because of rapid DNA degradation in
semitropical and temperate deposits. Here we apply proteomic analysis to screen
bone samples of the Late Quaternary South American native ungulate taxa Toxodon
(Notoungulata) and Macrauchenia (Litopterna) for phylogenetically informative
protein sequences. For each ungulate, we obtain approximately 90% direct sequence
coverage of type I collagen α1- and α2-chains, representing approximately 900 of 
1,140 amino-acid residues for each subunit. A phylogeny is estimated from an
alignment of these fossil sequences with collagen (I) gene transcripts from
available mammalian genomes or mass spectrometrically derived sequence data
obtained for this study. The resulting consensus tree agrees well with recent
higher-level mammalian phylogenies. Toxodon and Macrauchenia form a monophyletic 
group whose sister taxon is not Afrotheria or any of its constituent clades as
recently claimed, but instead crown Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, and
rhinoceroses). These results are consistent with the origin of at least some
South American native ungulates from 'condylarths', a paraphyletic assembly of
archaic placentals. With ongoing improvements in instrumentation and analytical
procedures, proteomics may produce a revolution in systematics such as that
achieved by genomics, but with the possibility of reaching much further back in
time.

Exceptionally preserved fossils from the Palaeozoic era provide crucial insights 
into arthropod evolution, with recent discoveries bringing phylogeny and
character homology into sharp focus. Integral to such studies are
anomalocaridids, a clade of stem arthropods whose remarkable morphology
illuminates early arthropod relationships and Cambrian ecology. Although recent
work has focused on the anomalocaridid head, the nature of their trunk has been
debated widely. Here we describe new anomalocaridid specimens from the Early
Ordovician Fezouata Biota of Morocco, which not only show well-preserved head
appendages providing key ecological data, but also elucidate the nature of
anomalocaridid trunk flaps, resolving their homology with arthropod trunk limbs. 
The new material shows that each trunk segment bears a separate dorsal and
ventral pair of flaps, with a series of setal blades attached at the base of the 
dorsal flaps. Comparisons with other stem lineage arthropods indicate that
anomalocaridid ventral flaps are homologous with lobopodous walking limbs and the
endopod of the euarthropod biramous limb, whereas the dorsal flaps and associated
setal blades are homologous with the flaps of gilled lobopodians (for example,
Kerygmachela kierkegaardi, Pambdelurion whittingtoni) and exites of the 'Cambrian
biramous limb'. This evidence shows that anomalocaridids represent a stage before
the fusion of exite and endopod into the 'Cambrian biramous limb', confirming
their basal placement in the euarthropod stem, rather than in the arthropod crown
or with cycloneuralian worms. Unlike other anomalocaridids, the Fezouata taxon
combines head appendages convergently adapted for filter-feeding with an
unprecedented body length exceeding 2 m, indicating a new direction in the
feeding ecology of the clade. The evolution of giant filter-feeding
anomalocaridids may reflect the establishment of highly developed planktic
ecosystems during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.

Since 2013 the occurrence of human infections by a novel avian H7N9 influenza
virus in China has demonstrated the continuing threat posed by zoonotic
pathogens. Although the first outbreak wave that was centred on eastern China was
seemingly averted, human infections recurred in October 2013 (refs 3-7). It is
unclear how the H7N9 virus re-emerged and how it will develop further;
potentially it may become a long-term threat to public health. Here we show that 
H7N9 viruses have spread from eastern to southern China and become persistent in 
chickens, which has led to the establishment of multiple regionally distinct
lineages with different reassortant genotypes. Repeated introductions of viruses 
from Zhejiang to other provinces and the presence of H7N9 viruses at live poultry
markets have fuelled the recurrence of human infections. This rapid expansion of 
the geographical distribution and genetic diversity of the H7N9 viruses poses a
direct challenge to current disease control systems. Our results also suggest
that H7N9 viruses have become enzootic in China and may spread beyond the region,
following the pattern previously observed with H5N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses.

Disruption of the MECP2 gene leads to Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurological 
disorder with features of autism. MECP2 encodes a methyl-DNA-binding protein that
has been proposed to function as a transcriptional repressor, but despite
numerous mouse studies examining neuronal gene expression in Mecp2 mutants, no
clear model has emerged for how MeCP2 protein regulates transcription. Here we
identify a genome-wide length-dependent increase in gene expression in MeCP2
mutant mouse models and human RTT brains. We present evidence that MeCP2
represses gene expression by binding to methylated CA sites within long genes,
and that in neurons lacking MeCP2, decreasing the expression of long genes
attenuates RTT-associated cellular deficits. In addition, we find that long genes
as a population are enriched for neuronal functions and selectively expressed in 
the brain. These findings suggest that mutations in MeCP2 may cause neurological 
dysfunction by specifically disrupting long gene expression in the brain.

Decadal variability is a notable feature of the Atlantic Ocean and the climate of
the regions it influences. Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic
Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative)
phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface
temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian
and Sahel rainfall, European summer precipitation, Atlantic hurricanes and
variations in global temperatures. It is widely believed that ocean circulation
drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content. However,
there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to
support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from
another source. Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized
link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea
level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on 
decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of 
Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation
changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres--the intergyre region. These
circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content
and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is
declining and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief
respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures, but in the coupled
system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative
AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the
northeast coast of the United States.

Robots have transformed many industries, most notably manufacturing, and have the
power to deliver tremendous benefits to society, such as in search and rescue,
disaster response, health care and transportation. They are also invaluable tools
for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant
planets to deep oceans. A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more
complex environments outside factories is their fragility. Whereas animals can
quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot 'think outside the box' to find 
a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their
pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure
modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential 
damage, an impracticality for complex robots. A promising approach to reducing
robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response
to damage, but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search
spaces. Here we introduce an intelligent trial-and-error algorithm that allows
robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without
requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is 
deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of
high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot's prior knowledge about
what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it
uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that
conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates
for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot
injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and 
for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm
will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the 
principles that animals use to adapt to injury.

Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) high-harmonic radiation emerging from laser-driven
atoms, molecules or plasmas underlies powerful attosecond spectroscopy techniques
and provides insight into fundamental structural and dynamic properties of
matter. The advancement of these spectroscopy techniques to study strong-field
electron dynamics in condensed matter calls for the generation and manipulation
of EUV radiation in bulk solids, but this capability has remained beyond the
reach of optical sciences. Recent experiments and theoretical predictions paved
the way to strong-field physics in solids by demonstrating the generation and
optical control of deep ultraviolet radiation in bulk semiconductors, driven by
femtosecond mid-infrared fields or the coherent up-conversion of terahertz fields
to multi-octave spectra in the mid-infrared and optical frequencies. Here we
demonstrate that thin films of SiO2 exposed to intense, few-cycle to sub-cycle
pulses give rise to wideband coherent EUV radiation extending in energy to about 
40 electronvolts. Our study indicates the association of the emitted EUV
radiation with intraband currents of multi-petahertz frequency, induced in the
lowest conduction band of SiO2. To demonstrate the applicability of high-harmonic
spectroscopy to solids, we exploit the EUV spectra to gain access to fine details
of the energy dispersion profile of the conduction band that are as yet
inaccessible by photoemission spectroscopy in wide-bandgap dielectrics. In
addition, we use the EUV spectra to trace the attosecond control of the intraband
electron motion induced by synthesized optical transients. Our work advances
lightwave electronics in condensed matter into the realm of multi-petahertz
frequencies and their attosecond control, and marks the advent of solid-state EUV
photonics.

Jets of highly energized plasma with relativistic velocities are associated with 
black holes ranging in mass from a few times that of the Sun to the
billion-solar-mass black holes at the centres of galaxies. A popular but
unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal
shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady. Faster components in
the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that
accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields. This mechanism can explain the
variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects, with the best
indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize
slower components in X-ray binary jets. Mapping of the kinematic profiles in
resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries,
apparent superluminal motions, and the ejection of knots (bright components) from
standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies. Observations revealing the
structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained
elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency
of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in
the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. A bright knot with an apparent speed of
(7.0 ± 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient
stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 ± 0.5)c just
downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots--as seen in the most recent
epoch of imaging.

Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) have experienced little
improvement in overall survival, and standard treatment has not advanced beyond
platinum-based combination chemotherapy, during the past 30 years. To understand 
the drivers of clinical phenotypes better, here we use whole-genome sequencing of
tumour and germline DNA samples from 92 patients with primary refractory,
resistant, sensitive and matched acquired resistant disease. We show that gene
breakage commonly inactivates the tumour suppressors RB1, NF1, RAD51B and PTEN in
HGSC, and contributes to acquired chemotherapy resistance. CCNE1 amplification
was common in primary resistant and refractory disease. We observed several
molecular events associated with acquired resistance, including multiple
independent reversions of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in individual
patients, loss of BRCA1 promoter methylation, an alteration in molecular subtype,
and recurrent promoter fusion associated with overexpression of the drug efflux
pump MDR1.

Middle Pliocene hominin species diversity has been a subject of debate over the
past two decades, particularly after the naming of Australopithecus bahrelghazali
and Kenyanthropus platyops in addition to the well-known species Australopithecus
afarensis. Further analyses continue to support the proposal that several hominin
species co-existed during this time period. Here we recognize a new hominin
species (Australopithecus deyiremeda sp. nov.) from 3.3-3.5-million-year-old
deposits in the Woranso-Mille study area, central Afar, Ethiopia. The new species
from Woranso-Mille shows that there were at least two contemporaneous hominin
species living in the Afar region of Ethiopia between 3.3 and 3.5 million years
ago, and further confirms early hominin taxonomic diversity in eastern Africa
during the Middle Pliocene epoch. The morphology of Au. deyiremeda also
reinforces concerns related to dentognathic (that is, jaws and teeth) homoplasy
in Plio-Pleistocene hominins, and shows that some dentognathic features
traditionally associated with Paranthropus and Homo appeared in the fossil record
earlier than previously thought.

Evolution has provided a source of inspiration for algorithm designers since the 
birth of computers. The resulting field, evolutionary computation, has been
successful in solving engineering tasks ranging in outlook from the molecular to 
the astronomical. Today, the field is entering a new phase as evolutionary
algorithms that take place in hardware are developed, opening up new avenues
towards autonomous machines that can adapt to their environment. We discuss how
evolutionary computation compares with natural evolution and what its benefits
are relative to other computing approaches, and we introduce the emerging area of
artificial evolution in physical systems.

Conventionally, engineers have employed rigid materials to fabricate precise,
predictable robotic systems, which are easily modelled as rigid members connected
at discrete joints. Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the
performance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, 
achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even
vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in
their compliant bones and soft tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun 
to explore the design and control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant
materials. This Review discusses recent developments in the emerging field of
soft robotics.

We are witnessing the advent of a new era of robots - drones - that can
autonomously fly in natural and man-made environments. These robots, often
associated with defence applications, could have a major impact on civilian
tasks, including transportation, communication, agriculture, disaster mitigation 
and environment preservation. Autonomous flight in confined spaces presents great
scientific and technical challenges owing to the energetic cost of staying
airborne and to the perceptual intelligence required to negotiate complex
environments. We identify scientific and technological advances that are expected
to translate, within appropriate regulatory frameworks, into pervasive use of
autonomous drones for civilian applications.

Cambridge CB2 1PZ, UK.

How can a machine learn from experience? Probabilistic modelling provides a
framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of
the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that
learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which
describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and
predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning,
robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an 
introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art
advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, 
data compression and automatic model discovery.

Reinforcement learning improves behaviour from evaluative feedback.

Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning concerned with using
experience gained through interacting with the world and evaluative feedback to
improve a system's ability to make behavioural decisions. It has been called the 
artificial intelligence problem in a microcosm because learning algorithms must
act autonomously to perform well and achieve their goals. Partly driven by the
increasing availability of rich data, recent years have seen exciting advances in
the theory and practice of reinforcement learning, including developments in
fundamental technical areas such as generalization, planning, exploration and
empirical methodology, leading to increasing applicability to real-life problems.

Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple
processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of
abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in
speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other
domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate
structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate
how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the 
representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep 
convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, 
speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such
as text and speech.

Counteraction of antibiotic production and degradation stabilizes microbial
communities.

Kelsic ED, Zhao J, Vetsigian K, Kishony R.

Comment in
    Nature. 2015 May 28;521(7553):431-2.

A major challenge in theoretical ecology is understanding how natural microbial
communities support species diversity, and in particular how
antibiotic-producing, -sensitive and -resistant species coexist. While cyclic
‘rock–paper–scissors’ interactions can stabilize communities in spatial
environments, coexistence in unstructured environments remains unexplained. Here,
using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of
antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed
environments. Coexistence depends on three-way interactions in which an
antibiotic-degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two
other species. These interactions enable coexistence that is robust to
substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by
‘cheating’ species that cease to produce or degrade antibiotics. At least two
antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics
enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamic behaviours ranging from
stable fixed points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how
multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both
spatially structured and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for
engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin
production and degradation for microbial biodiversity.

The Golgi complex has a central role in the intracellular sorting of secretory
proteins. Anterograde transport through the Golgi has been explained by the
movement of Golgi cisternae, known as cisternal maturation. Because this
explanation is now appreciated to be incomplete, interest has developed in
understanding tubules that connect the Golgi cisternae. Here we show that the
coat protein I (COPI) complex sorts anterograde cargoes into these tubules in
human cells. Moreover, the small GTPase CDC42 regulates bidirectional Golgi
transport by targeting the dual functions of COPI in cargo sorting and carrier
formation. CDC42 also directly imparts membrane curvature to promote COPI tubule 
formation. Our findings further reveal that COPI tubular transport complements
cisternal maturation in explaining how anterograde Golgi transport is achieved,
and that bidirectional COPI transport is modulated by environmental cues through 
CDC42.

Impaired mitochondrial maintenance in disparate cell types is a shared hallmark
of many human pathologies and ageing. How mitochondrial biogenesis coordinates
with the removal of damaged or superfluous mitochondria to maintain cellular
homeostasis is not well understood. Here we show that mitophagy, a selective type
of autophagy targeting mitochondria for degradation, interfaces with
mitochondrial biogenesis to regulate mitochondrial content and longevity in
Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that DCT-1 is a key mediator of mitophagy and
longevity assurance under conditions of stress in C. elegans. Impairment of
mitophagy compromises stress resistance and triggers mitochondrial retrograde
signalling through the SKN-1 transcription factor that regulates both
mitochondrial biogenesis genes and mitophagy by enhancing DCT-1 expression. Our
findings reveal a homeostatic feedback loop that integrates metabolic signals to 
coordinate the biogenesis and turnover of mitochondria. Uncoupling of these two
processes during ageing contributes to overproliferation of damaged mitochondria 
and decline of cellular function.

A large population of neurons can, in principle, produce an astronomical number
of distinct firing patterns. In cortex, however, these patterns lie in a space of
lower dimension, as if individual neurons were "obedient members of a huge
orchestra". Here we use recordings from the visual cortex of mouse (Mus musculus)
and monkey (Macaca mulatta) to investigate the relationship between individual
neurons and the population, and to establish the underlying circuit mechanisms.
We show that neighbouring neurons can differ in their coupling to the overall
firing of the population, ranging from strongly coupled 'choristers' to weakly
coupled 'soloists'. Population coupling is largely independent of sensory
preferences, and it is a fixed cellular attribute, invariant to stimulus
conditions. Neurons with high population coupling are more strongly affected by
non-sensory behavioural variables such as motor intention. Population coupling
reflects a causal relationship, predicting the response of a neuron to
optogenetically driven increases in local activity. Moreover, population coupling
indicates synaptic connectivity; the population coupling of a neuron, measured in
vivo, predicted subsequent in vitro estimates of the number of synapses received 
from its neighbours. Finally, population coupling provides a compact summary of
population activity; knowledge of the population couplings of n neurons predicts 
a substantial portion of their n(2) pairwise correlations. Population coupling
therefore represents a novel, simple measure that characterizes the relationship 
of each neuron to a larger population, explaining seemingly complex network
firing patterns in terms of basic circuit variables.

Small RNAs such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) silence
the expression of their complementary target messenger RNAs via the formation of 
effector RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which contain Argonaute (Ago)
family proteins at their core. Although loading of siRNA duplexes into Drosophila
Ago2 requires the Dicer-2-R2D2 heterodimer and the Hsc70/Hsp90 (Hsp90 also known 
as Hsp83) chaperone machinery, the details of RISC assembly remain unclear. Here 
we reconstitute RISC assembly using only Ago2, Dicer-2, R2D2, Hsc70, Hsp90, Hop, 
Droj2 (an Hsp40 homologue) and p23. By following the assembly of single RISC
molecules, we find that, in the absence of the chaperone machinery, an siRNA
bound to Dicer-2-R2D2 associates with Ago2 only transiently. The chaperone
machinery extends the dwell time of the Dicer-2-R2D2-siRNA complex on Ago2, in a 
manner dependent on recognition of the 5'-phosphate on the siRNA guide strand. We
propose that the chaperone machinery supports a productive state of Ago2,
allowing it to load siRNA duplexes from Dicer-2-R2D2 and thereby assemble RISC.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent birth defect, affecting
nearly 1% of live births; the incidence of CHD is up to tenfold higher in human
fetuses. A genetic contribution is strongly suggested by the association of CHD
with chromosome abnormalities and high recurrence risk. Here we report findings
from a recessive forward genetic screen in fetal mice, showing that cilia and
cilia-transduced cell signalling have important roles in the pathogenesis of CHD.
The cilium is an evolutionarily conserved organelle projecting from the cell
surface with essential roles in diverse cellular processes. Using
echocardiography, we ultrasound scanned 87,355 chemically mutagenized C57BL/6J
fetal mice and recovered 218 CHD mouse models. Whole-exome sequencing identified 
91 recessive CHD mutations in 61 genes. This included 34 cilia-related genes, 16 
genes involved in cilia-transduced cell signalling, and 10 genes regulating
vesicular trafficking, a pathway important for ciliogenesis and cell signalling. 
Surprisingly, many CHD genes encoded interacting proteins, suggesting that an
interactome protein network may provide a larger genomic context for CHD
pathogenesis. These findings provide novel insights into the potential Mendelian 
genetic contribution to CHD in the fetal population, a segment of the human
population not well studied. We note that the pathways identified show overlap
with CHD candidate genes recovered in CHD patients, suggesting that they may have
relevance to the more complex genetics of CHD overall. These CHD mouse models and
>8,000 incidental mutations have been sperm archived, creating a rich public
resource for human disease modelling.

Error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is achieved by homologous
recombination (HR), and BRCA1 is an important factor for this repair pathway. In 
the absence of BRCA1-mediated HR, the administration of PARP inhibitors induces
synthetic lethality of tumour cells of patients with breast or ovarian cancers.
Despite the benefit of this tailored therapy, drug resistance can occur by HR
restoration. Genetic reversion of BRCA1-inactivating mutations can be the
underlying mechanism of drug resistance, but this does not explain resistance in 
all cases. In particular, little is known about BRCA1-independent restoration of 
HR. Here we show that loss of REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) in mouse and human cell
lines re-establishes CTIP-dependent end resection of DSBs in BRCA1-deficient
cells, leading to HR restoration and PARP inhibitor resistance, which is reversed
by ATM kinase inhibition. REV7 is recruited to DSBs in a manner dependent on the 
H2AX-MDC1-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1 chromatin pathway, and seems to block HR and promote 
end joining in addition to its regulatory role in DNA damage tolerance. Finally, 
we establish that REV7 blocks DSB resection to promote non-homologous end-joining
during immunoglobulin class switch recombination. Our results reveal an
unexpected crucial function of REV7 downstream of 53BP1 in coordinating
pathological DSB repair pathway choices in BRCA1-deficient cells.

Appropriate repair of DNA lesions and the inhibition of DNA repair activities at 
telomeres are crucial to prevent genomic instability. By fuelling the generation 
of genetic alterations and by compromising cell viability, genomic instability is
a driving force in cancer and ageing. Here we identify MAD2L2 (also known as
MAD2B or REV7) through functional genetic screening as a novel factor controlling
DNA repair activities at mammalian telomeres. We show that MAD2L2 accumulates at 
uncapped telomeres and promotes non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated fusion
of deprotected chromosome ends and genomic instability. MAD2L2 depletion causes
elongated 3' telomeric overhangs, indicating that MAD2L2 inhibits 5' end
resection. End resection blocks NHEJ while committing to homology-directed
repair, and is under the control of 53BP1, RIF1 and PTIP. Consistent with MAD2L2 
promoting NHEJ-mediated telomere fusion by inhibiting 5' end resection, knockdown
of the nucleases CTIP or EXO1 partially restores telomere-driven genomic
instability in MAD2L2-depleted cells. Control of DNA repair by MAD2L2 is not
limited to telomeres. MAD2L2 also accumulates and inhibits end resection at
irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and promotes end-joining of DNA
double-strand breaks in several settings, including during immunoglobulin class
switch recombination. These activities of MAD2L2 depend on ATM kinase activity,
RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1 and RIF1, but not on PTIP, REV1 and REV3, the latter two
acting with MAD2L2 in translesion synthesis. Together, our data establish MAD2L2 
as a crucial contributor to the control of DNA repair activity by 53BP1 that
promotes NHEJ by inhibiting 5' end resection downstream of RIF1.

Anthrax toxin, comprising protective antigen, lethal factor, and oedema factor,
is the major virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, an agent that causes high
mortality in humans and animals. Protective antigen forms oligomeric prepores
that undergo conversion to membrane-spanning pores by endosomal acidification,
and these pores translocate the enzymes lethal factor and oedema factor into the 
cytosol of target cells. Protective antigen is not only a vaccine component and
therapeutic target for anthrax infections but also an excellent model system for 
understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. On the basis of biochemical
and electrophysiological results, researchers have proposed that a phi (Φ)-clamp 
composed of phenylalanine (Phe)427 residues of protective antigen catalyses
protein translocation via a charge-state-dependent Brownian ratchet. Although
atomic structures of protective antigen prepores are available, how protective
antigen senses low pH, converts to active pore, and translocates lethal factor
and oedema factor are not well defined without an atomic model of its pore. Here,
by cryo-electron microscopy with direct electron counting, we determine the
protective antigen pore structure at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals the 
long-sought-after catalytic Φ-clamp and the membrane-spanning translocation
channel, and supports the Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation.
Comparisons of four structures reveal conformational changes in prepore to pore
conversion that support a multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the 
membrane-spanning channel is formed.

All magnets elongate and contract anisotropically when placed in a magnetic
field, an effect referred to as Joule magnetostriction. The hallmark of Joulian
magnetostriction is volume conservation, which is a broader definition applicable
to self-accommodation of ferromagnetic, ferroelectric or ferroelastic domains in 
all functional materials. Here we report the discovery of 'giant'
non-volume-conserving or non-Joulian magnetostriction (NJM). Whereas Joulian
strain is caused by magnetization rotation, NJM is caused by facile (low-field)
reorientation of magnetoelastically and magnetostatically autarkic
(self-sufficient) rigid micro-'cells', which define the adaptive structure, the
origin of which is proposed to be elastic gradients ultimately caused by
charge/spin density waves. The equilibrium adaptive cellular structure is
responsible for long-sought non-dissipative (hysteresis-free), linearly
reversible and isotropic magnetization curves along all directions within a
single crystal. Recently discovered Fe-based high magnetostriction alloys with
special thermal history are identified as the first members of this newly
discovered magnetic class. The NJM paradigm provides consistent interpretations
of seemingly confounding properties of Fe-based alloys, offers recipes to develop
new highly magnetostrictive materials, and permits simultaneously large actuation
in longitudinal and transverse directions without the need for stacked
composites.

Mesoscopic superpositions of distinguishable coherent states provide an analogue 
of the 'Schrödinger's cat' thought experiment. For mechanical oscillators these
have primarily been realized using coherent wavepackets, for which the
distinguishability arises as a result of the spatial separation of the superposed
states. Here we demonstrate superpositions composed of squeezed wavepackets,
which we generate by applying an internal-state-dependent force to a single
trapped ion initialized in a squeezed vacuum state with nine decibel reduction in
the quadrature variance. This allows us to characterize the initial squeezed
wavepacket by monitoring the onset of spin-motion entanglement, and to verify the
evolution of the number states of the oscillator as a function of the duration of
the force. In both cases we observe clear differences between displacements
aligned with the squeezed and anti-squeezed axes. We observe coherent revivals
when inverting the state-dependent force after separating the wavepackets by more
than 19 times the ground-state root mean squared extent, which corresponds to 56 
times the root mean squared extent of the squeezed wavepacket along the
displacement direction. Aside from their fundamental nature, these states may be 
useful for quantum metrology or quantum information processing with continuous
variables.

Type Ia supernovae are thought to be the result of a thermonuclear runaway in
carbon/oxygen white dwarfs, but it is uncertain whether the explosion is
triggered by accretion from a non-degenerate companion star or by a merger with
another white dwarf. Observations of a supernova immediately following the
explosion provide unique information on the distribution of ejected material and 
the progenitor system. Models predict that the interaction of supernova ejecta
with a companion star or circumstellar debris lead to a sudden brightening
lasting from hours to days. Here we present data for three supernovae that are
likely to be type Ia observed during the Kepler mission with a time resolution of
30 minutes. We find no signatures of the supernova ejecta interacting with nearby
companions. The lack of observable interaction signatures is consistent with the 
idea that these three supernovae resulted from the merger of binary white dwarfs 
or other compact stars such as helium stars.

Type Ia supernovae are destructive explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs.
Although they are used empirically to measure cosmological distances, the nature 
of their progenitors remains mysterious. One of the leading progenitor models,
called the single degenerate channel, hypothesizes that a white dwarf accretes
matter from a companion star and the resulting increase in its central pressure
and temperature ignites thermonuclear explosion. Here we report observations with
the Swift Space Telescope of strong but declining ultraviolet emission from a
type Ia supernova within four days of its explosion. This emission is consistent 
with theoretical expectations of collision between material ejected by the
supernova and a companion star, and therefore provides evidence that some type Ia
supernovae arise from the single degenerate channel.

Human evolutionary scholars have long supposed that the earliest stone tools were
made by the genus Homo and that this technological development was directly
linked to climate change and the spread of savannah grasslands. New fieldwork in 
West Turkana, Kenya, has identified evidence of much earlier hominin
technological behaviour. We report the discovery of Lomekwi 3, a
3.3-million-year-old archaeological site where in situ stone artefacts occur in
spatiotemporal association with Pliocene hominin fossils in a wooded
palaeoenvironment. The Lomekwi 3 knappers, with a developing understanding of
stone's fracture properties, combined core reduction with battering activities.
Given the implications of the Lomekwi 3 assemblage for models aiming to converge 
environmental change, hominin evolution and technological origins, we propose for
it the name 'Lomekwian', which predates the Oldowan by 700,000 years and marks a 
new beginning to the known archaeological record.

Classical crystallography can determine structures as complicated as
multi-component ribosomal assemblies with atomic resolution, but is inadequate
for disordered systems--even those as simple as water ice--that occupy the
complex middle ground between liquid-like randomness and crystalline periodic
order. Correlated disorder nevertheless has clear crystallographic signatures
that map to the type of disorder, irrespective of the underlying physical or
chemical interactions and material involved. This mapping hints at a common
language for disordered states that will help us to understand, control and
exploit the disorder responsible for many interesting physical properties.

It is generally believed that splicing removes introns as single units from
precursor messenger RNA transcripts. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster
introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that 
enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The
extent to which recursive splicing occurs in other species and its mechanistic
basis have not been examined. Here we identify highly conserved RS-sites in genes
expressed in the mammalian brain that encode proteins functioning in neuronal
development. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns
across vertebrates. We find that vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial
definition of an 'RS-exon' that follows the RS-site. The RS-exon is then excluded
from the dominant mRNA isoform owing to competition with a reconstituted 5'
splice site formed at the RS-site after the first splicing step. Conversely, the 
RS-exon is included when preceded by cryptic promoters or exons that fail to
reconstitute an efficient 5' splice site. Most RS-exons contain a premature stop 
codon such that their inclusion can decrease mRNA stability. Thus, by
establishing a binary splicing switch, RS-sites demarcate different mRNA isoforms
emerging from long genes by coupling cryptic elements with inclusion of RS-exons.

Na(+)/Cl(-)-coupled biogenic amine transporters are the primary targets of
therapeutic and abused drugs, ranging from antidepressants to the
psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamines, and to their cognate substrates. Here 
we determine X-ray crystal structures of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine
transporter (dDAT) bound to its substrate dopamine, a substrate analogue
3,4-dichlorophenethylamine, the psychostimulants d-amphetamine and
methamphetamine, or to cocaine and cocaine analogues. All ligands bind to the
central binding site, located approximately halfway across the membrane bilayer, 
in close proximity to bound sodium and chloride ions. The central binding site
recognizes three chemically distinct classes of ligands via conformational
changes that accommodate varying sizes and shapes, thus illustrating molecular
principles that distinguish substrates from inhibitors in biogenic amine
transporters.

Recursive splicing is a process in which large introns are removed in multiple
steps by re-splicing at ratchet points--5' splice sites recreated after splicing.
Recursive splicing was first identified in the Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx)
gene and only three additional Drosophila genes have since been experimentally
shown to undergo recursive splicing. Here we identify 197 zero nucleotide exon
ratchet points in 130 introns of 115 Drosophila genes from total RNA sequencing
data generated from developmental time points, dissected tissues and cultured
cells. The sequential nature of recursive splicing was confirmed by
identification of lariat introns generated by splicing to and from the ratchet
points. We also show that recursive splicing is a constitutive process, that
depletion of U2AF inhibits recursive splicing, and that the sequence and function
of ratchet points are evolutionarily conserved in Drosophila. Finally, we
identify four recursively spliced human genes, one of which is also recursively
spliced in Drosophila. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing
is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the
mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.

Pluripotency, the ability to generate any cell type of the body, is an evanescent
attribute of embryonic cells. Transitory pluripotent cells can be captured at
different time points during embryogenesis and maintained as embryonic stem cells
or epiblast stem cells in culture. Since ontogenesis is a dynamic process in both
space and time, it seems counterintuitive that these two temporal states
represent the full spectrum of organismal pluripotency. Here we show that by
modulating culture parameters, a stem-cell type with unique spatial
characteristics and distinct molecular and functional features, designated as
region-selective pluripotent stem cells (rsPSCs), can be efficiently obtained
from mouse embryos and primate pluripotent stem cells, including humans. The ease
of culturing and editing the genome of human rsPSCs offers advantages for
regenerative medicine applications. The unique ability of human rsPSCs to
generate post-implantation interspecies chimaeric embryos may facilitate our
understanding of early human development and evolution.

The current outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa is unprecedented, causing more
cases and fatalities than all previous outbreaks combined, and has yet to be
controlled. Several post-exposure interventions have been employed under
compassionate use to treat patients repatriated to Europe and the United States. 
However, the in vivo efficacy of these interventions against the new outbreak
strain of Ebola virus is unknown. Here we show that
lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) rapidly adapted
to target the Makona outbreak strain of Ebola virus are able to protect 100% of
rhesus monkeys against lethal challenge when treatment was initiated at 3 days
after exposure while animals were viraemic and clinically ill. Although all
infected animals showed evidence of advanced disease including abnormal
haematology, blood chemistry and coagulopathy, siRNA-treated animals had milder
clinical features and fully recovered, while the untreated control animals
succumbed to the disease. These results represent the first, to our knowledge,
successful demonstration of therapeutic anti-Ebola virus efficacy against the new
outbreak strain in nonhuman primates and highlight the rapid development of
lipid-nanoparticle-delivered siRNA as a countermeasure against this highly lethal
human disease.

In the context of most induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming methods,
heterogeneous populations of non-productive and staggered productive
intermediates arise at different reprogramming time points. Despite recent
reports claiming substantially increased reprogramming efficiencies using
genetically modified donor cells, prospectively isolating distinct reprogramming 
intermediates remains an important goal to decipher reprogramming mechanisms.
Previous attempts to identify surface markers of intermediate cell populations
were based on the assumption that, during reprogramming, cells progressively lose
donor cell identity and gradually acquire iPS cell properties. Here we report
that iPS cell and epithelial markers, such as SSEA1 and EpCAM, respectively, are 
not predictive of reprogramming during early phases. Instead, in a systematic
functional surface marker screen, we find that early reprogramming-prone cells
express a unique set of surface markers, including CD73, CD49d and CD200, that
are absent in both fibroblasts and iPS cells. Single-cell mass cytometry and
prospective isolation show that these distinct intermediates are transient and
bridge the gap between donor cell silencing and pluripotency marker acquisition
during the early, presumably stochastic, reprogramming phase. Expression
profiling reveals early upregulation of the transcriptional regulators Nr0b1 and 
Etv5 in this reprogramming state, preceding activation of key pluripotency
regulators such as Rex1 (also known as Zfp42), Dppa2, Nanog and Sox2. Both
factors are required for the generation of the early intermediate state and fully
reprogrammed iPS cells, and thus represent some of the earliest known regulators 
of iPS cell induction. Our study deconvolutes the first steps in a hierarchical
series of events that lead to pluripotency acquisition.

B cells are selected for an intermediate level of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)
signalling strength: attenuation below minimum (for example, non-functional BCR) 
or hyperactivation above maximum (for example, self-reactive BCR) thresholds of
signalling strength causes negative selection. In ∼25% of cases, acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells carry the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase 
(Philadelphia chromosome positive), which mimics constitutively active pre-BCR
signalling. Current therapeutic approaches are largely focused on the development
of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to suppress oncogenic signalling below 
a minimum threshold for survival. We tested the hypothesis that targeted
hyperactivation--above a maximum threshold--will engage a deletional checkpoint
for removal of self-reactive B cells and selectively kill ALL cells. Here we
find, by testing various components of proximal pre-BCR signalling in mouse
BCR-ABL1 cells, that an incremental increase of Syk tyrosine kinase activity was 
required and sufficient to induce cell death. Hyperactive Syk was functionally
equivalent to acute activation of a self-reactive BCR on ALL cells. Despite
oncogenic transformation, this basic mechanism of negative selection was still
functional in ALL cells. Unlike normal pre-B cells, patient-derived ALL cells
express the inhibitory receptors PECAM1, CD300A and LAIR1 at high levels. Genetic
studies revealed that Pecam1, Cd300a and Lair1 are critical to calibrate
oncogenic signalling strength through recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatases 
Ptpn6 (ref. 7) and Inpp5d (ref. 8). Using a novel small-molecule inhibitor of
INPP5D (also known as SHIP1), we demonstrated that pharmacological
hyperactivation of SYK and engagement of negative B-cell selection represents a
promising new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.

Adult stem cells occur in niches that balance self-renewal with lineage selection
and progression during tissue homeostasis. Following injury, culture or
transplantation, stem cells outside their niche often display fate flexibility.
Here we show that super-enhancers underlie the identity, lineage commitment and
plasticity of adult stem cells in vivo. Using hair follicle as a model, we map
the global chromatin domains of hair follicle stem cells and their committed
progenitors in their native microenvironments. We show that super-enhancers and
their dense clusters ('epicentres') of transcription factor binding sites undergo
remodelling upon lineage progression. New fate is acquired by decommissioning old
and establishing new super-enhancers and/or epicentres, an auto-regulatory
process that abates one master regulator subset while enhancing another. We
further show that when outside their niche, either in vitro or in wound-repair,
hair follicle stem cells dynamically remodel super-enhancers in response to
changes in their microenvironment. Intriguingly, some key super-enhancers shift
epicentres, enabling their genes to remain active and maintain a transitional
state in an ever-changing transcriptional landscape. Finally, we identify SOX9 as
a crucial chromatin rheostat of hair follicle stem cell super-enhancers, and
provide functional evidence that super-enhancers are dynamic, dense
transcription-factor-binding platforms which are acutely sensitive to pioneer
master regulators whose levels define not only spatial and temporal features of
lineage-status but also stemness, plasticity in transitional states and
differentiation.

Genetic variation segregating within a species reflects the combined activities
of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. In the absence of selection,
polymorphisms are expected to be a random subset of new mutations; thus,
comparing the effects of polymorphisms and new mutations provides a test for
selection. When evidence of selection exists, such comparisons can identify
properties of mutations that are most likely to persist in natural populations.
Here we investigate how mutation and selection have shaped variation in a
cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression by empirically determining
the effects of polymorphisms segregating in the TDH3 promoter among 85 strains of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comparing their effects to a distribution of
mutational effects defined by 236 point mutations in the same promoter.
Surprisingly, we find that selection on expression noise (that is, variability in
expression among genetically identical cells) appears to have had a greater
impact on sequence variation in the TDH3 promoter than selection on mean
expression level. This is not necessarily because variation in expression noise
impacts fitness more than variation in mean expression level, but rather because 
of differences in the distributions of mutational effects for these two
phenotypes. This study shows how systematically examining the effects of new
mutations can enrich our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. It also
provides rare empirical evidence of selection acting on expression noise.

Perceptual decisions are based on the activity of sensory cortical neurons, but
how organisms learn to transform this activity into appropriate actions remains
unknown. Projections from the auditory cortex to the auditory striatum carry
information that drives decisions in an auditory frequency discrimination task.
To assess the role of these projections in learning, we developed a
channelrhodopsin-2-based assay to probe selectively for synaptic plasticity
associated with corticostriatal neurons representing different frequencies. Here 
we report that learning this auditory discrimination preferentially potentiates
corticostriatal synapses from neurons representing either high or low
frequencies, depending on reward contingencies. We observe frequency-dependent
corticostriatal potentiation in vivo over the course of training, and in vitro in
striatal brain slices. Our findings suggest a model in which the corticostriatal 
synapses made by neurons tuned to different features of the sound are selectively
potentiated to enable the learned transformation of sound into action.

Eukaryotic vacuolar H(+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) are rotary enzymes that use energy
from hydrolysis of ATP to ADP to pump protons across membranes and control the pH
of many intracellular compartments. ATP hydrolysis in the soluble catalytic
region of the enzyme is coupled to proton translocation through the
membrane-bound region by rotation of a central rotor subcomplex, with peripheral 
stalks preventing the entire membrane-bound region from turning with the rotor.
The eukaryotic V-ATPase is the most complex rotary ATPase: it has three
peripheral stalks, a hetero-oligomeric proton-conducting proteolipid ring,
several subunits not found in other rotary ATPases, and is regulated by
reversible dissociation of its catalytic and proton-conducting regions. Studies
of ATP synthases, V-ATPases, and bacterial/archaeal V/A-ATPases have suggested
that flexibility is necessary for the catalytic mechanism of rotary ATPases, but 
the structures of different rotational states have never been observed
experimentally. Here we use electron cryomicroscopy to obtain structures for
three rotational states of the V-ATPase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
The resulting series of structures shows ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, 
setting the ATP:H(+) ratio for proton pumping by the V-ATPase at 3:10, and
reveals long and highly tilted transmembrane α-helices in the a-subunit that
interact with the c-ring. The three different maps reveal the conformational
changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble
catalytic region to the membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of
the subunits of the enzyme undergo conformational changes during the transitions 
between these three rotational states. The structures of these states provide
direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth transmission 
of power through rotary ATPases.

Riverine export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the ocean affects the
atmospheric carbon inventory over a broad range of timescales. On geological
timescales, the balance between sequestration of POC from the terrestrial
biosphere and oxidation of rock-derived (petrogenic) organic carbon sets the
magnitude of the atmospheric carbon and oxygen reservoirs. Over shorter
timescales, variations in the rate of exchange between carbon reservoirs, such as
soils and marine sediments, also modulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The 
respective fluxes of biospheric and petrogenic organic carbon are poorly
constrained, however, and mechanisms controlling POC export have remained
elusive, limiting our ability to predict POC fluxes quantitatively as a result of
climatic or tectonic changes. Here we estimate biospheric and petrogenic POC
fluxes for a suite of river systems representative of the natural variability in 
catchment properties. We show that export yields of both biospheric and
petrogenic POC are positively related to the yield of suspended sediment,
revealing that POC export is mostly controlled by physical erosion. Using a
global compilation of gauged suspended sediment flux, we derive separate
estimates of global biospheric and petrogenic POC fluxes of 157(+74)(-50) and
43(+61)(-25) megatonnes of carbon per year, respectively. We find that biospheric
POC export is primarily controlled by the capacity of rivers to mobilize and
transport POC, and is largely insensitive to the magnitude of terrestrial primary
production. Globally, physical erosion rates affect the rate of biospheric POC
burial in marine sediments more strongly than carbon sequestration through
silicate weathering. We conclude that burial of biospheric POC in marine
sediments becomes the dominant long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide sink under
enhanced physical erosion.

Coherent manipulation of quantum systems with light is expected to be a
cornerstone of future information and communication technology, including quantum
computation and cryptography. The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum
wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of
quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated
electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of
attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and
orbital tomography. In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of
energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises
direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses
on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state
manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We
employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical near-fields to 
induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed
as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling 
of an equal-Rabi multilevel quantum ladder is obtained, representing the
observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk' coherently reshaping electron
density in momentum space. We note that, after the interaction, the optically
generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond
electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the
precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging
from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and
free-electron lasers.

Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is the first and best known superconducting
semiconductor. It exhibits an extremely low carrier density threshold for
superconductivity, and possesses a phase diagram similar to that of
high-temperature superconductors--two factors that suggest an unconventional
pairing mechanism. Despite sustained interest for 50 years, direct experimental
insight into the nature of electron pairing in SrTiO3 has remained elusive. Here 
we perform transport experiments with nanowire-based single-electron transistors 
at the interface between SrTiO3 and a thin layer of lanthanum aluminate, LaAlO3. 
Electrostatic gating reveals a series of two-electron conductance
resonances-paired electron states--that bifurcate above a critical pairing field 
Bp of about 1-4 tesla, an order of magnitude larger than the superconducting
critical magnetic field. For magnetic fields below Bp, these resonances are
insensitive to the applied magnetic field; for fields in excess of Bp, the
resonances exhibit a linear Zeeman-like energy splitting. Electron pairing is
stable at temperatures as high as 900 millikelvin, well above the superconducting
transition temperature (about 300 millikelvin). These experiments demonstrate the
existence of a robust electronic phase in which electrons pair without forming a 
superconducting state. Key experimental signatures are captured by a model
involving an attractive Hubbard interaction that describes real-space electron
pairing as a precursor to superconductivity.

Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich)
and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for
quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and
passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or
stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is
so-called "strangulation", in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is
halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of
elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from
26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism 
responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four
billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10(11)
solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age
difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that
quiescent galaxies of less than 10(11) solar masses are on average observed four 
billion years after quenching due to strangulation.

Many animals navigate using a combination of visual landmarks and path
integration. In mammalian brains, head direction cells integrate these two
streams of information by representing an animal's heading relative to landmarks,
yet maintaining their directional tuning in darkness based on self-motion cues.
Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster
walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based
orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses
of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a toroidal structure in the
centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative
to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on
self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a
representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through 
persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several
features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular
anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors, network structures that
have been proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits.

The origin of the eukaryotic cell remains one of the most contentious puzzles in 
modern biology. Recent studies have provided support for the emergence of the
eukaryotic host cell from within the archaeal domain of life, but the identity
and nature of the putative archaeal ancestor remain a subject of debate. Here we 
describe the discovery of 'Lokiarchaeota', a novel candidate archaeal phylum,
which forms a monophyletic group with eukaryotes in phylogenomic analyses, and
whose genomes encode an expanded repertoire of eukaryotic signature proteins that
are suggestive of sophisticated membrane remodelling capabilities. Our results
provide strong support for hypotheses in which the eukaryotic host evolved from a
bona fide archaeon, and demonstrate that many components that underpin
eukaryote-specific features were already present in that ancestor. This provided 
the host with a rich genomic 'starter-kit' to support the increase in the
cellular and genomic complexity that is characteristic of eukaryotes.

Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression, but the mechanisms by
which they act are still largely unknown. One of the best-studied lncRNAs is
Xist, which is required for transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome during 
development in female mammals. Despite extensive efforts to define the mechanism 
of Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing, we still do not know any proteins
required for this role. The main challenge is that there are currently no methods
to comprehensively define the proteins that directly interact with a lncRNA in
the cell. Here we develop a method to purify a lncRNA from cells and identify
proteins interacting with it directly using quantitative mass spectrometry. We
identify ten proteins that specifically associate with Xist, three of these
proteins--SHARP, SAF-A and LBR--are required for Xist-mediated transcriptional
silencing. We show that SHARP, which interacts with the SMRT co-repressor that
activates HDAC3, is not only essential for silencing, but is also required for
the exclusion of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) from the inactive X. Both SMRT and
HDAC3 are also required for silencing and Pol II exclusion. In addition to
silencing transcription, SHARP and HDAC3 are required for Xist-mediated
recruitment of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) across the X chromosome. 
Our results suggest that Xist silences transcription by directly interacting with
SHARP, recruiting SMRT, activating HDAC3, and deacetylating histones to exclude
Pol II across the X chromosome.

Homeostasis is a biological principle for regulation of essential physiological
parameters within a set range. Behavioural responses due to deviation from
homeostasis are critical for survival, but motivational processes engaged by
physiological need states are incompletely understood. We examined motivational
characteristics of two separate neuron populations that regulate energy and fluid
homeostasis by using cell-type-specific activity manipulations in mice. We found 
that starvation-sensitive AGRP neurons exhibit properties consistent with a
negative-valence teaching signal. Mice avoided activation of AGRP neurons,
indicating that AGRP neuron activity has negative valence. AGRP neuron inhibition
conditioned preference for flavours and places. Correspondingly, deep-brain
calcium imaging revealed that AGRP neuron activity rapidly reduced in response to
food-related cues. Complementary experiments activating thirst-promoting neurons 
also conditioned avoidance. Therefore, these need-sensing neurons condition
preference for environmental cues associated with nutrient or water ingestion,
which is learned through reduction of negative-valence signals during restoration
of homeostasis.

Vertebrates have a unique 3D body shape in which correct tissue and organ shape
and alignment are essential for function. For example, vision requires the lens
to be centred in the eye cup which must in turn be correctly positioned in the
head. Tissue morphogenesis depends on force generation, force transmission
through the tissue, and response of tissues and extracellular matrix to force.
Although a century ago D'Arcy Thompson postulated that terrestrial animal body
shapes are conditioned by gravity, there has been no animal model directly
demonstrating how the aforementioned mechano-morphogenetic processes are
coordinated to generate a body shape that withstands gravity. Here we report a
unique medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) mutant, hirame (hir), which is sensitive to 
deformation by gravity. hir embryos display a markedly flattened body caused by
mutation of YAP, a nuclear executor of Hippo signalling that regulates organ
size. We show that actomyosin-mediated tissue tension is reduced in hir embryos, 
leading to tissue flattening and tissue misalignment, both of which contribute to
body flattening. By analysing YAP function in 3D spheroids of human cells, we
identify the Rho GTPase activating protein ARHGAP18 as an effector of YAP in
controlling tissue tension. Together, these findings reveal a previously
unrecognised function of YAP in regulating tissue shape and alignment required
for proper 3D body shape. Understanding this morphogenetic function of YAP could 
facilitate the use of embryonic stem cells to generate complex organs requiring
correct alignment of multiple tissues.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 2-3%
of the population worldwide and has severe effects on patients' physical and
psychological well-being. The discovery that psoriasis is an immune-mediated
disease has led to more targeted, effective therapies; recent advances have
focused on the interleukin (IL)-12/23p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23.
Evidence suggests that specific inhibition of IL-23 would result in improvement
in psoriasis. Here we evaluate tildrakizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets 
the IL-23p19 subunit, in a three-part, randomized, placebo-controlled,
sequential, rising multiple-dose phase I study in patients with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis to provide clinical proof that specific targeting of
IL-23p19 results in symptomatic improvement of disease severity in human
subjects. A 75% reduction in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score
(PASI75) was achieved by all subjects in parts 1 and 3 (pooled) in the 3 and
10 mg kg(-1) groups by day 196. In part 2, 10 out of 15 subjects in the
3 mg kg(-1) group and 13 out of 14 subjects in the 10 mg kg(-1) group achieved a 
PASI75 by day 112. Tildrakizumab demonstrated important clinical improvement in
moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients as demonstrated by improvements in PASI
scores and histological samples.

Over 20% of Earth's terrestrial surface is underlain by permafrost with vast
stores of carbon that, once thawed, may represent the largest future transfer of 
carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere. This process is largely dependent on
microbial responses, but we know little about microbial activity in intact, let
alone in thawing, permafrost. Molecular approaches have recently revealed the
identities and functional gene composition of microorganisms in some permafrost
soils and a rapid shift in functional gene composition during short-term thaw
experiments. However, the fate of permafrost carbon depends on climatic,
hydrological and microbial responses to thaw at decadal scales. Here we use the
combination of several molecular 'omics' approaches to determine the phylogenetic
composition of the microbial communities, including several draft genomes of
novel species, their functional potential and activity in soils representing
different states of thaw: intact permafrost, seasonally thawed active layer and
thermokarst bog. The multi-omics strategy reveals a good correlation of process
rates to omics data for dominant processes, such as methanogenesis in the bog, as
well as novel survival strategies for potentially active microbes in permafrost.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play central roles in innate
immune signalling networks in plants and animals. In plants, however, the
molecular mechanisms of how signal perception is transduced to MAPK activation
remain elusive. Here we report that pathogen-secreted proteases activate a
previously unknown signalling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana involving the Gα,
Gβ, and Gγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-protein complexes, which function
upstream of an MAPK cascade. In this pathway, receptor for activated C kinase 1
(RACK1) functions as a novel scaffold that binds to the Gβ subunit as well as to 
all three tiers of the MAPK cascade, thereby linking upstream G-protein
signalling to downstream activation of an MAPK cascade. The
protease-G-protein-RACK1-MAPK cascade modules identified in these studies are
distinct from previously described plant immune signalling pathways such as that 
elicited by bacterial flagellin, in which G proteins function downstream of or in
parallel to an MAPK cascade without the involvement of the RACK1 scaffolding
protein. The discovery of the new protease-mediated immune signalling pathway
described here was facilitated by the use of the broad host range, opportunistic 
bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ability of P. aeruginosa to infect
both plants and animals makes it an excellent model to identify novel
immunoregulatory strategies that account for its niche adaptation to diverse host
tissues and immune systems.

Long-standing evidence indicates that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
preferentially integrates into a subset of transcriptionally active genes of the 
host cell genome. However, the reason why the virus selects only certain genes
among all transcriptionally active regions in a target cell remains largely
unknown. Here we show that HIV-1 integration occurs in the outer shell of the
nucleus in close correspondence with the nuclear pore. This region contains a
series of cellular genes, which are preferentially targeted by the virus, and
characterized by the presence of active transcription chromatin marks before
viral infection. In contrast, the virus strongly disfavours the heterochromatic
regions in the nuclear lamin-associated domains and other transcriptionally
active regions located centrally in the nucleus. Functional viral integrase and
the presence of the cellular Nup153 and LEDGF/p75 integration cofactors are
indispensable for the peripheral integration of the virus. Once integrated at the
nuclear pore, the HIV-1 DNA makes contact with various nucleoporins; this
association takes part in the transcriptional regulation of the viral genome.
These results indicate that nuclear topography is an essential determinant of the
HIV-1 life cycle.

ATP, the universal energy currency of cells, is produced by F-type ATP synthases,
which are ancient, membrane-bound nanomachines. F-type ATP synthases use the
energy of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient to generate ATP by rotary
catalysis. Protons moving across the membrane drive a rotor ring composed of 8-15
c-subunits. A central stalk transmits the rotation of the c-ring to the catalytic
F1 head, where a series of conformational changes results in ATP synthesis. A key
unresolved question in this fundamental process is how protons pass through the
membrane to drive ATP production. Mitochondrial ATP synthases form V-shaped
homodimers in cristae membranes. Here we report the structure of a native and
active mitochondrial ATP synthase dimer, determined by single-particle electron
cryomicroscopy at 6.2 Å resolution. Our structure shows four long, horizontal
membrane-intrinsic α-helices in the a-subunit, arranged in two hairpins at an
angle of approximately 70° relative to the c-ring helices. It has been proposed
that a strictly conserved membrane-embedded arginine in the a-subunit couples
proton translocation to c-ring rotation. A fit of the conserved carboxy-terminal 
a-subunit sequence places the conserved arginine next to a proton-binding
c-subunit glutamate. The map shows a slanting solvent-accessible channel that
extends from the mitochondrial matrix to the conserved arginine. Another
hydrophilic cavity on the lumenal membrane surface defines a direct route for the
protons to an essential histidine-glutamate pair. Our results provide unique new 
insights into the structure and function of rotary ATP synthases and explain how 
ATP production is coupled to proton translocation.

Internal gravity waves, the subsurface analogue of the familiar surface gravity
waves that break on beaches, are ubiquitous in the ocean. Because of their strong
vertical and horizontal currents, and the turbulent mixing caused by their
breaking, they affect a panoply of ocean processes, such as the supply of
nutrients for photosynthesis, sediment and pollutant transport and acoustic
transmission; they also pose hazards for man-made structures in the ocean.
Generated primarily by the wind and the tides, internal waves can travel
thousands of kilometres from their sources before breaking, making it challenging
to observe them and to include them in numerical climate models, which are
sensitive to their effects. For over a decade, studies have targeted the South
China Sea, where the oceans' most powerful known internal waves are generated in 
the Luzon Strait and steepen dramatically as they propagate west. Confusion has
persisted regarding their mechanism of generation, variability and energy budget,
however, owing to the lack of in situ data from the Luzon Strait, where extreme
flow conditions make measurements difficult. Here we use new observations and
numerical models to (1) show that the waves begin as sinusoidal disturbances
rather than arising from sharp hydraulic phenomena, (2) reveal the existence of
>200-metre-high breaking internal waves in the region of generation that give
rise to turbulence levels >10,000 times that in the open ocean, (3) determine
that the Kuroshio western boundary current noticeably refracts the internal wave 
field emanating from the Luzon Strait, and (4) demonstrate a factor-of-two
agreement between modelled and observed energy fluxes, which allows us to produce
an observationally supported energy budget of the region. Together, these
findings give a cradle-to-grave picture of internal waves on a basin scale, which
will support further improvements of their representation in numerical climate
predictions.

Despite much progress in semiconductor integrated circuit technology, the extreme
complexity of the human cerebral cortex, with its approximately 10(14) synapses, 
makes the hardware implementation of neuromorphic networks with a comparable
number of devices exceptionally challenging. To provide comparable complexity
while operating much faster and with manageable power dissipation, networks based
on circuits combining complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOSs) and
adjustable two-terminal resistive devices (memristors) have been developed. In
such circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several crossbar
layers, with memristors at each crosspoint. There have recently been notable
improvements in the fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their
integration with CMOS circuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical 
integration. Separately, discrete memristors have been used as artificial
synapses in neuromorphic networks. Very recently, such experiments have been
extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The adjustment of
such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each crosspoint, and 
hence these devices are much harder to scale than metal-oxide memristors, whose
nonlinear current-voltage curves enable transistor-free operation. Here we report
the experimental implementation of transistor-free metal-oxide memristor
crossbars, with device variability sufficiently low to allow operation of
integrated neural networks, in a simple network: a single-layer perceptron (an
algorithm for linear classification). The network can be taught in situ using a
coarse-grain variety of the delta rule algorithm to perform the perfect
classification of 3 × 3-pixel black/white images into three classes (representing
letters). This demonstration is an important step towards much larger and more
complex memristive neuromorphic networks.

Observations of the south pole of the Saturnian moon Enceladus revealed large
rifts in the south-polar terrain, informally called 'tiger stripes', named
Alexandria, Baghdad, Cairo and Damascus Sulci. These fractures have been shown to
be the sources of the observed jets of water vapour and icy particles and to
exhibit higher temperatures than the surrounding terrain. Subsequent observations
have focused on obtaining close-up imaging of this region to better characterize 
these emissions. Recent work examined those newer data sets and used
triangulation of discrete jets to produce maps of jetting activity at various
times. Here we show that much of the eruptive activity can be explained by broad,
curtain-like eruptions. Optical illusions in the curtain eruptions resulting from
a combination of viewing direction and local fracture geometry produce image
features that were probably misinterpreted previously as discrete jets. We
present maps of the total emission along the fractures, rather than just the
jet-like component, for five times during an approximately one-year period in
2009 and 2010. An accurate picture of the style, timing and spatial distribution 
of the south-polar eruptions is crucial to evaluating theories for the mechanism 
controlling the eruptions.

When cosmic star formation history reaches a peak (at about redshift z ≈ 2),
galaxies vigorously fed by cosmic reservoirs are dominated by gas and contain
massive star-forming clumps, which are thought to form by violent gravitational
instabilities in highly turbulent gas-rich disks. However, a clump formation
event has not yet been observed, and it is debated whether clumps can survive
energetic feedback from young stars, and afterwards migrate inwards to form
galaxy bulges. Here we report the spatially resolved spectroscopy of a bright
off-nuclear emission line region in a galaxy at z = 1.987. Although this region
dominates star formation in the galaxy disk, its stellar continuum remains
undetected in deep imaging, revealing an extremely young (less than ten million
years old) massive clump, forming through the gravitational collapse of more than
one billion solar masses of gas. Gas consumption in this young clump is more than
tenfold faster than in the host galaxy, displaying high star-formation efficiency
during this phase, in agreement with our hydrodynamic simulations. The frequency 
of older clumps with similar masses, coupled with our initial estimate of their
formation rate (about 2.5 per billion years), supports long lifetimes (about 500 
million years), favouring models in which clumps survive feedback and grow the
bulges of present-day galaxies.

The wings of birds and their closest theropod relatives share a uniform
fundamental architecture, with pinnate flight feathers as the key component. Here
we report a new scansoriopterygid theropod, Yi qi gen. et sp. nov., based on a
new specimen from the Middle-Upper Jurassic period Tiaojishan Formation of Hebei 
Province, China. Yi is nested phylogenetically among winged theropods but has
large stiff filamentous feathers of an unusual type on both the forelimb and
hindlimb. However, the filamentous feathers of Yi resemble pinnate feathers in
bearing morphologically diverse melanosomes. Most surprisingly, Yi has a long
rod-like bone extending from each wrist, and patches of membranous tissue
preserved between the rod-like bones and the manual digits. Analogous features
are unknown in any dinosaur but occur in various flying and gliding tetrapods,
suggesting the intriguing possibility that Yi had membranous aerodynamic surfaces
totally different from the archetypal feathered wings of birds and their closest 
relatives. Documentation of the unique forelimbs of Yi greatly increases the
morphological disparity known to exist among dinosaurs, and highlights the
extraordinary breadth and richness of the evolutionary experimentation that took 
place close to the origin of birds.

Crypt stem cells represent the cells of origin for intestinal neoplasia. Both
mouse and human intestinal stem cells can be cultured in medium containing the
stem-cell-niche factors WNT, R-spondin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and noggin 
over long time periods as epithelial organoids that remain genetically and
phenotypically stable. Here we utilize CRISPR/Cas9 technology for targeted gene
modification of four of the most commonly mutated colorectal cancer genes (APC,
P53 (also known as TP53), KRAS and SMAD4) in cultured human intestinal stem
cells. Mutant organoids can be selected by removing individual growth factors
from the culture medium. Quadruple mutants grow independently of all
stem-cell-niche factors and tolerate the presence of the P53 stabilizer nutlin-3.
Upon xenotransplantation into mice, quadruple mutants grow as tumours with
features of invasive carcinoma. Finally, combined loss of APC and P53 is
sufficient for the appearance of extensive aneuploidy, a hallmark of tumour
progression.

Cancer-associated genetic alterations induce expression of tumour antigens that
can activate CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), but the microenvironment of
established tumours promotes immune tolerance through poorly understood
mechanisms. Recently developed therapeutics that overcome tolerogenic mechanisms 
activate tumour-directed CTLs and are effective in some human cancers. Immune
mechanisms also affect treatment outcome, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs
stimulate cancer-specific immune responses by inducing immunogenic cell death and
other effector mechanisms. Our previous studies revealed that B cells recruited
by the chemokine CXCL13 into prostate cancer tumours promote the progression of
castrate-resistant prostate cancer by producing lymphotoxin, which activates an
IκB kinase α (IKKα)-BMI1 module in prostate cancer stem cells. Because
castrate-resistant prostate cancer is refractory to most therapies, we examined B
cell involvement in the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance. Here we focus on 
oxaliplatin, an immunogenic chemotherapeutic agent that is effective in
aggressive prostate cancer. We show that mouse B cells modulate the response to
low-dose oxaliplatin, which promotes tumour-directed CTL activation by inducing
immunogenic cell death. Three different mouse prostate cancer models were
refractory to oxaliplatin unless genetically or pharmacologically depleted of B
cells. The crucial immunosuppressive B cells are plasmocytes that express IgA,
interleukin (IL)-10 and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), the appearance of
which depends on TGFβ receptor signalling. Elimination of these cells, which also
infiltrate human-therapy-resistant prostate cancer, allows CTL-dependent
eradication of oxaliplatin-treated tumours.

Whereas cancers grow within host tissues and evade host immunity through
immune-editing and immunosuppression, tumours are rarely transmissible between
individuals. Much like transplanted allogeneic organs, allogeneic tumours are
reliably rejected by host T cells, even when the tumour and host share the same
major histocompatibility complex alleles, the most potent determinants of
transplant rejection. How such tumour-eradicating immunity is initiated remains
unknown, although elucidating this process could provide the basis for inducing
similar responses against naturally arising tumours. Here we find that allogeneic
tumour rejection is initiated in mice by naturally occurring tumour-binding IgG
antibodies, which enable dendritic cells (DCs) to internalize tumour antigens and
subsequently activate tumour-reactive T cells. We exploited this mechanism to
treat autologous and autochthonous tumours successfully. Either systemic
administration of DCs loaded with allogeneic-IgG-coated tumour cells or
intratumoral injection of allogeneic IgG in combination with DC stimuli induced
potent T-cell-mediated antitumour immune responses, resulting in tumour
eradication in mouse models of melanoma, pancreas, lung and breast cancer.
Moreover, this strategy led to eradication of distant tumours and metastases, as 
well as the injected primary tumours. To assess the clinical relevance of these
findings, we studied antibodies and cells from patients with lung cancer. T cells
from these patients responded vigorously to autologous tumour antigens after
culture with allogeneic-IgG-loaded DCs, recapitulating our findings in mice.
These results reveal that tumour-binding allogeneic IgG can induce powerful
antitumour immunity that can be exploited for cancer immunotherapy.

The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on insect pollinators is highly
controversial. Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and
reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported
negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater
than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other
available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice
feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed
bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of
three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam 
(TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to 
eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone.
Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from
gustatory neurons in the bees' mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of
sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste
neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions
containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused
them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their
exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with
IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.

Understanding the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees is vital because 
of reported declines in bee diversity and distribution and the crucial role bees 
have as pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture. Neonicotinoids are suspected
to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in 
plants, and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three
neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees. The
moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence, particularly
because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed
neonicotinoids. Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and 
wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes. Here we show that
a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious
consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we
found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of
the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid β-cyfluthrin,
applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting,
and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such 
insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural
landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees
may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee
colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be
extrapolated to wild bees.

Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2) is the first light-driven Na(+) pump
discovered, and is viewed as a potential next-generation optogenetics tool. Since
the positively charged Schiff base proton, located within the ion-conducting
pathway of all light-driven ion pumps, was thought to prohibit the transport of a
non-proton cation, the discovery of KR2 raised the question of how it achieves
Na(+) transport. Here we present crystal structures of KR2 under neutral and
acidic conditions, which represent the resting and M-like intermediate states,
respectively. Structural and spectroscopic analyses revealed the gating
mechanism, whereby the flipping of Asp116 sequesters the Schiff base proton from 
the conducting pathway to facilitate Na(+) transport. Together with the
structure-based engineering of the first light-driven K(+) pumps,
electrophysiological assays in mammalian neurons and behavioural assays in a
nematode, our studies reveal the molecular basis for light-driven non-proton
cation pumps and thus provide a framework that may advance the development of
next-generation optogenetics.

The basal ganglia are phylogenetically conserved subcortical nuclei necessary for
coordinated motor action and reward learning. Current models postulate that the
basal ganglia modulate cerebral cortex indirectly via an inhibitory output to
thalamus, bidirectionally controlled by direct- and indirect-pathway striatal
projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively). The basal ganglia thalamic
output sculpts cortical activity by interacting with signals from sensory and
motor systems. Here we describe a direct projection from the globus pallidus
externus (GP), a central nucleus of the basal ganglia, to frontal regions of the 
cerebral cortex (FC). Two cell types make up the GP-FC projection, distinguished 
by their electrophysiological properties, cortical projections and expression of 
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), a synthetic enzyme for the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine (ACh). Despite these differences, ChAT(+) cells, which have been
historically identified as an extension of the nucleus basalis, as well as
ChAT(-) cells, release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)
and are inhibited by iSPNs and dSPNs of dorsal striatum. Thus, GP-FC cells
comprise a direct GABAergic/cholinergic projection under the control of striatum 
that activates frontal cortex in vivo. Furthermore, iSPN inhibition of GP-FC
cells is sensitive to dopamine 2 receptor signalling, revealing a pathway by
which drugs that target dopamine receptors for the treatment of neuropsychiatric 
disorders can act in the basal ganglia to modulate frontal cortices.

Cancer genome sequencing has revealed considerable variation in somatic mutation 
rates across the human genome, with mutation rates elevated in heterochromatic
late replicating regions and reduced in early replicating euchromatin. Multiple
mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this, but the actual cause is unknown.
Here we identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as the basis of this
variation. Analysing ∼17 million single-nucleotide variants from the genomes of
652 tumours, we show that regional autosomal mutation rates at megabase
resolution are largely stable across cancer types, with differences related to
changes in replication timing and gene expression. However, mutations arising
after the inactivation of MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating
heterochromatin relative to early replicating euchromatin. Thus, differential DNA
repair and not differential mutation supply is the primary cause of the
large-scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome.

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mega-enzyme complexes are modular
assembly lines that are involved in the biosynthesis of numerous peptide
metabolites independently of the ribosome. The multiple interactions between
catalytic domains within the NRPS machinery are further complemented by
additional interactions with external enzymes, particularly focused on the final 
peptide maturation process. An important class of NRPS metabolites that require
extensive external modification of the NRPS-bound peptide are the glycopeptide
antibiotics (GPAs), which include vancomycin and teicoplanin. These clinically
relevant peptide antibiotics undergo cytochrome P450-catalysed oxidative
crosslinking of aromatic side chains to achieve their final, active conformation.
However, the mechanism underlying the recruitment of the cytochrome P450
oxygenases to the NRPS-bound peptide was previously unknown. Here we show,
through in vitro studies, that the X-domain, a conserved domain of unknown
function present in the final module of all GPA NRPS machineries, is responsible 
for the recruitment of oxygenases to the NRPS-bound peptide to perform the
essential side-chain crosslinking. X-ray crystallography shows that the X-domain 
is structurally related to condensation domains, but that its amino acid
substitutions render it catalytically inactive. We found that the X-domain
recruits cytochrome P450 oxygenases to the NRPS and determined the interface by
solving the structure of a P450-X-domain complex. Additionally, we demonstrated
that the modification of peptide precursors by oxygenases in vitro--in particular
the installation of the second crosslink in GPA biosynthesis--occurs only in the 
presence of the X-domain. Our results indicate that the presentation of peptidyl 
carrier protein (PCP)-bound substrates for oxidation in GPA biosynthesis requires
the presence of the NRPS X-domain to ensure conversion of the precursor peptide
into a mature aglycone, and that the carrier protein domain alone is not always
sufficient to generate a competent substrate for external cytochrome P450
oxygenases.

The proliferation of genetically modified mouse models has exposed phenotypic
variation between investigators and institutions that has been challenging to
control. In many cases, the microbiota is the presumed cause of the variation.
Current solutions to account for phenotypic variability include littermate and
maternal controls or defined microbial consortia in gnotobiotic mice. In
conventionally raised mice, the microbiome is transmitted from the dam. Here we
show that microbially driven dichotomous faecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in 
wild-type mice within the same facility mimic the effects of chromosomal
mutations. We observe in multiple facilities that vertically transmissible
bacteria in IgA-low mice dominantly lower faecal IgA levels in IgA-high mice
after co-housing or faecal transplantation. In response to injury, IgA-low mice
show increased damage that is transferable by faecal transplantation and driven
by faecal IgA differences. We find that bacteria from IgA-low mice degrade the
secretory component of secretory IgA as well as IgA itself. These data indicate
that phenotypic comparisons between mice must take into account the
non-chromosomal hereditary variation between different breeders. We propose
faecal IgA as one marker of microbial variability and conclude that co-housing
and/or faecal transplantation enables analysis of progeny from different dams.

The ability to differentiate stimuli predicting positive or negative outcomes is 
critical for survival, and perturbations of emotional processing underlie many
psychiatric disease states. Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala
complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and
negative. Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding
associations, but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic 
mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have
remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus
accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo 
opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that
photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while
photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement.
Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward
conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by
comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features.
Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation of positive 
and negative associations within the amygdala.

The last glacial period exhibited abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger climatic
oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of Northern Hemisphere 
palaeoclimate archives. Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm
phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa, suggesting an
interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar
seesaw. Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)
strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains
regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events. Key information is
contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the
large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the
relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far
precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision.
Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that,
on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling
onset by 218 ± 92 years (2σ) for Dansgaard-Oeschger events, including the Bølling
event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by
208 ± 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the
abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high
latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar
phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the
climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm
a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear
criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard-Oeschger
dynamics.

The large-scale growth of semiconducting thin films forms the basis of modern
electronics and optoelectronics. A decrease in film thickness to the ultimate
limit of the atomic, sub-nanometre length scale, a difficult limit for
traditional semiconductors (such as Si and GaAs), would bring wide benefits for
applications in ultrathin and flexible electronics, photovoltaics and display
technology. For this, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which can form
stable three-atom-thick monolayers, provide ideal semiconducting materials with
high electrical carrier mobility, and their large-scale growth on insulating
substrates would enable the batch fabrication of atomically thin high-performance
transistors and photodetectors on a technologically relevant scale without film
transfer. In addition, their unique electronic band structures provide novel ways
of enhancing the functionalities of such devices, including the large excitonic
effect, bandgap modulation, indirect-to-direct bandgap transition,
piezoelectricity and valleytronics. However, the large-scale growth of monolayer 
TMD films with spatial homogeneity and high electrical performance remains an
unsolved challenge. Here we report the preparation of high-mobility 4-inch
wafer-scale films of monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and tungsten
disulphide, grown directly on insulating SiO2 substrates, with excellent spatial 
homogeneity over the entire films. They are grown with a newly developed,
metal-organic chemical vapour deposition technique, and show high electrical
performance, including an electron mobility of 30 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at room
temperature and 114 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) at 90 K for MoS2, with little dependence on
position or channel length. With the use of these films we successfully
demonstrate the wafer-scale batch fabrication of high-performance monolayer MoS2 
field-effect transistors with a 99% device yield and the multi-level fabrication 
of vertically stacked transistor devices for three-dimensional circuitry. Our
work is a step towards the realization of atomically thin integrated circuitry.

The Galactic Centre hosts a puzzling stellar population in its inner few parsecs,
with a high abundance of surprisingly young, relatively massive stars bound
within the deep potential well of the central supermassive black hole,
Sagittarius A* (ref. 1). Previous studies suggest that the population of objects 
emitting soft X-rays (less than 10 kiloelectronvolts) within the surrounding
hundreds of parsecs, as well as the population responsible for unresolved X-ray
emission extending along the Galactic plane, is dominated by accreting white
dwarf systems. Observations of diffuse hard-X-ray (more than 10
kiloelectronvolts) emission in the inner 10 parsecs, however, have been hampered 
by the limited spatial resolution of previous instruments. Here we report the
presence of a distinct hard-X-ray component within the central 4 × 8 parsecs, as 
revealed by subarcminute-resolution images in the 20-40 kiloelectronvolt range.
This emission is more sharply peaked towards the Galactic Centre than is the
surface brightness of the soft-X-ray population. This could indicate a
significantly more massive population of accreting white dwarfs, large
populations of low-mass X-ray binaries or millisecond pulsars, or particle
outflows interacting with the surrounding radiation field, dense molecular
material or magnetic fields. However, all these interpretations pose significant 
challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution, binary formation, and
cosmic-ray production in the Galactic Centre.

Electron valley, a degree of freedom that is analogous to spin, can lead to novel
topological phases in bilayer graphene. A tunable bandgap can be induced in
bilayer graphene by an external electric field, and such gapped bilayer graphene 
is predicted to be a topological insulating phase protected by no-valley mixing
symmetry, featuring quantum valley Hall effects and chiral edge states.
Observation of such chiral edge states, however, is challenging because
inter-valley scattering is induced by atomic-scale defects at real bilayer
graphene edges. Recent theoretical work has shown that domain walls between AB-
and BA-stacked bilayer graphene can support protected chiral edge states of
quantum valley Hall insulators. Here we report an experimental observation of
ballistic (that is, with no scattering of electrons) conducting channels at
bilayer graphene domain walls. We employ near-field infrared nanometre-scale
microscopy (nanoscopy) to image in situ bilayer graphene layer-stacking domain
walls on device substrates, and we fabricate dual-gated field effect transistors 
based on the domain walls. Unlike single-domain bilayer graphene, which shows
gapped insulating behaviour under a vertical electrical field, bilayer graphene
domain walls feature one-dimensional valley-polarized conducting channels with a 
ballistic length of about 400 nanometres at 4 kelvin. Such topologically
protected one-dimensional chiral states at bilayer graphene domain walls open up 
opportunities for exploring unique topological phases and valley physics in
graphene.

TP53, a well-known tumour suppressor gene that encodes p53, is frequently
inactivated by mutation or deletion in most human tumours. A tremendous effort
has been made to restore p53 activity in cancer therapies. However, no effective 
p53-based therapy has been successfully translated into clinical cancer treatment
owing to the complexity of p53 signalling. Here we demonstrate that genomic
deletion of TP53 frequently encompasses essential neighbouring genes, rendering
cancer cells with hemizygous TP53 deletion vulnerable to further suppression of
such genes. POLR2A is identified as such a gene that is almost always co-deleted 
with TP53 in human cancers. It encodes the largest and catalytic subunit of the
RNA polymerase II complex, which is specifically inhibited by α-amanitin. Our
analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) databases reveals that POLR2A expression levels are tightly correlated
with its gene copy numbers in human colorectal cancer. Suppression of POLR2A with
α-amanitin or small interfering RNAs selectively inhibits the proliferation,
survival and tumorigenic potential of colorectal cancer cells with hemizygous
TP53 loss in a p53-independent manner. Previous clinical applications of
α-amanitin have been limited owing to its liver toxicity. However, we found that 
α-amanitin-based antibody-drug conjugates are highly effective therapeutic agents
with reduced toxicity. Here we show that low doses of α-amanitin-conjugated
anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody lead to complete tumour
regression in mouse models of human colorectal cancer with hemizygous deletion of
POLR2A. We anticipate that inhibiting POLR2A will be a new therapeutic approach
for human cancers containing such common genomic alterations.

Tumour-specific mutations are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy as they lack
expression in healthy tissues and can potentially be recognized as neo-antigens
by the mature T-cell repertoire. Their systematic targeting by vaccine
approaches, however, has been hampered by the fact that every patient's tumour
possesses a unique set of mutations ('the mutanome') that must first be
identified. Recently, we proposed a personalized immunotherapy approach to target
the full spectrum of a patient's individual tumour-specific mutations. Here we
show in three independent murine tumour models that a considerable fraction of
non-synonymous cancer mutations is immunogenic and that, unexpectedly, the
majority of the immunogenic mutanome is recognized by CD4(+) T cells. Vaccination
with such CD4(+) immunogenic mutations confers strong antitumour activity.
Encouraged by these findings, we established a process by which mutations
identified by exome sequencing could be selected as vaccine targets solely
through bioinformatic prioritization on the basis of their expression levels and 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-binding capacity for rapid
production as synthetic poly-neo-epitope messenger RNA vaccines. We show that
vaccination with such polytope mRNA vaccines induces potent tumour control and
complete rejection of established aggressively growing tumours in mice. Moreover,
we demonstrate that CD4(+) T cell neo-epitope vaccination reshapes the tumour
microenvironment and induces cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against an
independent immunodominant antigen in mice, indicating orchestration of antigen
spread. Finally, we demonstrate an abundance of mutations predicted to bind to
MHC class II in human cancers as well by employing the same predictive algorithm 
on corresponding human cancer types. Thus, the tailored immunotherapy approach
introduced here may be regarded as a universally applicable blueprint for
comprehensive exploitation of the substantial neo-epitope target repertoire of
cancers, enabling the effective targeting of every patient's tumour with vaccines
produced 'just in time'.

Ribosomes are translational machineries that catalyse protein synthesis. Ribosome
structures from various species are known at the atomic level, but obtaining the 
structure of the human ribosome has remained a challenge; efforts to address this
would be highly relevant with regard to human diseases. Here we report the
near-atomic structure of the human ribosome derived from high-resolution
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and atomic model building. The structure
has an average resolution of 3.6 Å, reaching 2.9 Å resolution in the most stable 
regions. It provides unprecedented insights into ribosomal RNA entities and amino
acid side chains, notably of the transfer RNA binding sites and specific
molecular interactions with the exit site tRNA. It reveals atomic details of the 
subunit interface, which is seen to remodel strongly upon rotational movements of
the ribosomal subunits. Furthermore, the structure paves the way for analysing
antibiotic side effects and diseases associated with deregulated protein
synthesis.

Natural events present multiple types of sensory cues, each detected by a
specialized sensory modality. Combining information from several modalities is
essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding
multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal
convergence and how these patterns contribute to behaviour. Modalities could
converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy.
Here we show that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically
enhances the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion in Drosophila
larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous
system, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy,
spanning multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy. The wiring diagram 
revealed a complex multilevel multimodal convergence architecture. Using
behavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected
circuit nodes that trigger the fastest locomotor mode, and others that facilitate
it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration
contribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel multimodal
convergence architecture may be a general feature of multisensory circuits
enabling complex input-output functions and selective tuning to ecologically
relevant combinations of cues.

Artemisinins are the cornerstone of anti-malarial drugs. Emergence and spread of 
resistance to them raises risk of wiping out recent gains achieved in reducing
worldwide malaria burden and threatens future malaria control and elimination on 
a global level. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed parasite
genetic loci associated with artemisinin resistance. However, there is no
consensus on biochemical targets of artemisinin. Whether and how these targets
interact with genes identified by GWAS, remains unknown. Here we provide
biochemical and cellular evidence that artemisinins are potent inhibitors of
Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PfPI3K), revealing an
unexpected mechanism of action. In resistant clinical strains, increased PfPI3K
was associated with the C580Y mutation in P. falciparum Kelch13 (PfKelch13), a
primary marker of artemisinin resistance. Polyubiquitination of PfPI3K and its
binding to PfKelch13 were reduced by the PfKelch13 mutation, which limited
proteolysis of PfPI3K and thus increased levels of the kinase, as well as its
lipid product phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P). We find PI3P levels to be 
predictive of artemisinin resistance in both clinical and engineered laboratory
parasites as well as across non-isogenic strains. Elevated PI3P induced
artemisinin resistance in absence of PfKelch13 mutations, but remained responsive
to regulation by PfKelch13. Evidence is presented for PI3P-dependent signalling
in which transgenic expression of an additional kinase confers resistance.
Together these data present PI3P as the key mediator of artemisinin resistance
and the sole PfPI3K as an important target for malaria elimination.

The family Filoviridae contains three genera, Ebolavirus (EBOV), Marburg virus,
and Cuevavirus. Some members of the EBOV genus, including Zaire ebolavirus
(ZEBOV), can cause lethal haemorrhagic fever in humans. During 2014 an
unprecedented ZEBOV outbreak occurred in West Africa and is still ongoing,
resulting in over 10,000 deaths, and causing global concern of uncontrolled
disease. To meet this challenge a rapid-acting vaccine is needed. Many vaccine
approaches have shown promise in being able to protect nonhuman primates against 
ZEBOV. In response to the current ZEBOV outbreak several of these vaccines have
been fast tracked for human use. However, it is not known whether any of these
vaccines can provide protection against the new outbreak Makona strain of ZEBOV. 
One of these approaches is a first-generation recombinant vesicular stomatitis
virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/ZEBOV).
To address safety concerns associated with this vector, we developed two
candidate, further-attenuated rVSV/ZEBOV vaccines. Both attenuated vaccines
produced an approximately tenfold lower vaccine-associated viraemia compared to
the first-generation vaccine and both provided complete, single-dose protection
of macaques from lethal challenge with the Makona outbreak strain of ZEBOV.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a central mediator of allergic (atopic) inflammation.
Therapies directed against IgE can alleviate hay fever and allergic asthma.
Genetic association studies have not yet identified novel therapeutic targets or 
pathways underlying IgE regulation. We therefore surveyed epigenetic associations
between serum IgE concentrations and methylation at loci concentrated in CpG
islands genome wide in 95 nuclear pedigrees, using DNA from peripheral blood
leukocytes. We validated positive results in additional families and in subjects 
from the general population. Here we show replicated associations--with a
meta-analysis false discovery rate less than 10(-4)--between IgE and low
methylation at 36 loci. Genes annotated to these loci encode known eosinophil
products, and also implicate phospholipid inflammatory mediators, specific
transcription factors and mitochondrial proteins. We confirmed that methylation
at these loci differed significantly in isolated eosinophils from subjects with
and without asthma and high IgE levels. The top three loci accounted for 13% of
IgE variation in the primary subject panel, explaining the tenfold higher
variance found compared with that derived from large single-nucleotide
polymorphism genome-wide association studies. This study identifies novel
therapeutic targets and biomarkers for patient stratification for allergic
diseases.

Plants and plant pathogens are subject to continuous co-evolutionary pressure for
dominance, and the outcomes of these interactions can substantially impact
agriculture and food security. In virus-plant interactions, one of the major
mechanisms for plant antiviral immunity relies on RNA silencing, which is often
suppressed by co-evolving virus suppressors, thus enhancing viral pathogenicity
in susceptible hosts. In addition, plants use the nucleotide-binding and
leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) domain-containing resistance proteins, which
recognize viral effectors to activate effector-triggered immunity in a defence
mechanism similar to that employed in non-viral infections. Unlike most
eukaryotic organisms, plants are not known to activate mechanisms of host global 
translation suppression to fight viruses. Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that
the constitutive activation of NIK1, a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase
(LRR-RLK) identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle
protein (NSP), leads to global translation suppression and translocation of the
downstream component RPL10 to the nucleus, where it interacts with a newly
identified MYB-like protein, L10-INTERACTING MYB DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN
(LIMYB), to downregulate translational machinery genes fully. LIMYB
overexpression represses ribosomal protein genes at the transcriptional level,
resulting in protein synthesis inhibition, decreased viral messenger RNA
association with polysome fractions and enhanced tolerance to begomovirus. By
contrast, the loss of LIMYB function releases the repression of
translation-related genes and increases susceptibility to virus infection.
Therefore, LIMYB links immune receptor LRR-RLK activation to global translation
suppression as an antiviral immunity strategy in plants.

Innate immunity serves as the first line of defence against invading pathogens
such as bacteria and viruses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are examples of innate
immune receptors, which sense specific molecular patterns from pathogens and
activate immune responses. TLR9 recognizes bacterial and viral DNA containing the
cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dideoxynucleotide motif. The molecular basis by 
which CpG-containing DNA (CpG-DNA) elicits immunostimulatory activity via TLR9
remains to be elucidated. Here we show the crystal structures of three forms of
TLR9: unliganded, bound to agonistic CpG-DNA, and bound to inhibitory DNA (iDNA).
Agonistic-CpG-DNA-bound TLR9 formed a symmetric TLR9-CpG-DNA complex with 2:2
stoichiometry, whereas iDNA-bound TLR9 was a monomer. CpG-DNA was recognized by
both protomers in the dimer, in particular by the amino-terminal fragment
(LRRNT-LRR10) from one protomer and the carboxy-terminal fragment (LRR20-LRR22)
from the other. The iDNA, which formed a stem-loop structure suitable for binding
by intramolecular base pairing, bound to the concave surface from LRR2-LRR10.
This structure serves as an important basis for improving our understanding of
the functional mechanisms of TLR9.

Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all organisms that must have been available
since the origin of life. Abiotic processes including hydrothermal reduction,
photochemical reactions, or lightning discharge could have converted atmospheric 
N2 into assimilable NH4(+), HCN, or NOx species, collectively termed fixed
nitrogen. But these sources may have been small on the early Earth, severely
limiting the size of the primordial biosphere. The evolution of the
nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase, which reduces atmospheric N2 to organic
NH4(+), thus represented a major breakthrough in the radiation of life, but its
timing is uncertain. Here we present nitrogen isotope ratios with a mean of
0.0 ± 1.2‰ from marine and fluvial sedimentary rocks of prehnite-pumpellyite to
greenschist metamorphic grade between 3.2 and 2.75 billion years ago. These data 
cannot readily be explained by abiotic processes and therefore suggest biological
nitrogen fixation, most probably using molybdenum-based nitrogenase as opposed to
other variants that impart significant negative fractionations. Our data place a 
minimum age constraint of 3.2 billion years on the origin of biological nitrogen 
fixation and suggest that molybdenum was bioavailable in the mid-Archaean ocean
long before the Great Oxidation Event.

The six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide is the pivot point of the
biogeochemical cycle of the element sulfur. The octahaem cytochrome c MccA (also 
known as SirA) catalyses this reaction for dissimilatory sulfite utilization by
various bacteria. It is distinct from known sulfite reductases because it has a
substantially higher catalytic activity and a relatively low reactivity towards
nitrite. The mechanistic reasons for the increased efficiency of MccA remain to
be elucidated. Here we show that anoxically purified MccA exhibited a 2- to
5.5-fold higher specific sulfite reductase activity than the enzyme isolated
under oxic conditions. We determined the three-dimensional structure of MccA to
2.2 Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. We find a homotrimer 
with an unprecedented fold and haem arrangement, as well as a haem bound to a
CX15CH motif. The heterobimetallic active-site haem 2 has a Cu(I) ion juxtaposed 
to a haem c at a Fe-Cu distance of 4.4 Å. While the combination of metals is
reminiscent of respiratory haem-copper oxidases, the oxidation-labile Cu(I)
centre of MccA did not seem to undergo a redox transition during catalysis.
Intact MccA tightly bound SO2 at haem 2, a dehydration product of the substrate
sulfite that was partially turned over due to photoreduction by X-ray
irradiation, yielding the reaction intermediate SO. Our data show the biometal
copper in a new context and function and provide a chemical rationale for the
comparatively high catalytic activity of MccA.

Pathogens play an important part in shaping the structure and dynamics of natural
communities, because species are not affected by them equally. A shared goal of
ecology and epidemiology is to predict when a species is most vulnerable to
disease. A leading hypothesis asserts that the impact of disease should increase 
with host abundance, producing a 'rare-species advantage'. However, the impact of
a pathogen may be decoupled from host abundance, because most pathogens infect
more than one species, leading to pathogen spillover onto closely related
species. Here we show that the phylogenetic and ecological structure of the
surrounding community can be important predictors of disease pressure. We found
that the amount of tissue lost to disease increased with the relative abundance
of a species across a grassland plant community, and that this rare-species
advantage had an additional phylogenetic component: disease pressure was stronger
on species with many close relatives. We used a global model of pathogen sharing 
as a function of relatedness between hosts, which provided a robust predictor of 
relative disease pressure at the local scale. In our grassland, the total amount 
of disease was most accurately explained not by the abundance of the focal host
alone, but by the abundance of all species in the community weighted by their
phylogenetic distance to the host. Furthermore, the model strongly predicted
observed disease pressure for 44 novel host species we introduced experimentally 
to our study site, providing evidence for a mechanism to explain why
phylogenetically rare species are more likely to become invasive when introduced.
Our results demonstrate how the phylogenetic and ecological structure of
communities can have a key role in disease dynamics, with implications for the
maintenance of biodiversity, biotic resistance against introduced weeds, and the 
success of managed plants in agriculture and forestry.

Landscapes on Earth retain a record of the tectonic, environmental and climatic
history under which they formed. Landscapes tend towards an equilibrium in which 
rivers attain a stable grade that balances the tectonic production of elevation
and with hillslopes that attain a gradient steep enough to transport material to 
river channels. Equilibrium low-relief surfaces are typically found at low
elevations, graded to sea level. However, there are many examples of
high-elevation, low-relief surfaces, often referred to as relict landscapes, or
as elevated peneplains. These do not grade to sea level and are typically
interpreted as uplifted old landscapes, preserving former, more moderate tectonic
conditions. Here we test this model of landscape evolution through digital
topographic analysis of a set of purportedly relict landscapes on the
southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, one of the most geographically
complex, climatically varied and biologically diverse regions of the world. We
find that, in contrast to theory, the purported surfaces are not consistent with 
progressive establishment of a new, steeper, river grade, and therefore they
cannot necessarily be interpreted as a remnant of an old, low relief surface. We 
propose an alternative model, supported by numerical experiments, in which
tectonic deformation has disrupted the regional river network, leaving remnants
of it isolated and starved of drainage area and thus unable to balance tectonic
uplift. The implication is that the state of low relief with low erosion rate is 
developing in situ, rather than preserving past erosional conditions.

In optics, the ability to measure individual quanta of light (photons) enables a 
great many applications, ranging from dynamic imaging within living organisms to 
secure quantum communication. Pioneering photon counting experiments, such as the
intensity interferometry performed by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure the
angular width of visible stars, have played a critical role in our understanding 
of the full quantum nature of light. As with matter at the atomic scale, the laws
of quantum mechanics also govern the properties of macroscopic mechanical
objects, providing fundamental quantum limits to the sensitivity of mechanical
sensors and transducers. Current research in cavity optomechanics seeks to use
light to explore the quantum properties of mechanical systems ranging in size
from kilogram-mass mirrors to nanoscale membranes, as well as to develop
technologies for precision sensing and quantum information processing. Here we
use an optical probe and single-photon detection to study the acoustic emission
and absorption processes in a silicon nanomechanical resonator, and perform a
measurement similar to that used by Hanbury Brown and Twiss to measure
correlations in the emitted phonons as the resonator undergoes a parametric
instability formally equivalent to that of a laser. Owing to the cavity-enhanced 
coupling of light with mechanical motion, this effective phonon counting
technique has a noise equivalent phonon sensitivity of 0.89 ± 0.05. With
straightforward improvements to this method, a variety of quantum state
engineering tasks using mesoscopic mechanical resonators would be enabled,
including the generation and heralding of single-phonon Fock states and the
quantum entanglement of remote mechanical elements.

Fossils of early gnathostomes (or jawed vertebrates) have been the focus of study
for nearly two centuries. They yield key clues about the evolutionary assembly of
the group's common body plan, as well the divergence of the two living
gnathostome lineages: the cartilaginous and bony vertebrates. A series of
remarkable new palaeontological discoveries, analytical advances and innovative
reinterpretations of existing fossil archives have fundamentally altered a
decades-old consensus on the relationships of extinct gnathostomes, delivering a 
new evolutionary framework for exploring major questions that remain unanswered, 
including the origin of jaws.

The interrelationships between major living vertebrate, and even chordate, groups
are now reasonably well resolved thanks to a large amount of generally congruent 
data derived from molecular sequences, anatomy and physiology. But fossils
provide unexpected combinations of characters that help us to understand how the 
anatomy of modern groups was progressively shaped over millions of years. The
dawn of vertebrates is documented by fossils that are preserved as either
soft-tissue imprints, or minute skeletal fragments, and it is sometimes difficult
for palaeontologists to tell which of them are reliable vertebrate remains and
which merely reflect our idea of an ancestral vertebrate.

The origin of vertebrates was accompanied by the advent of a novel cell type: the
neural crest. Emerging from the central nervous system, these cells migrate to
diverse locations and differentiate into numerous derivatives. By coupling
morphological and gene regulatory information from vertebrates and other
chordates, we describe how addition of the neural-crest-specification program may
have enabled cells at the neural plate border to acquire multipotency and
migratory ability. Analysis of the topology of the neural crest gene regulatory
network can serve as a useful template for understanding vertebrate evolution,
including elaboration of neural crest derivatives.

It has been more than 30 years since the publication of the new head hypothesis, 
which proposed that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from
the emergence of neural crest and cranial placodes. Neural crest generates the
skull and associated connective tissues, whereas placodes produce sensory organs.
However, neither crest nor placodes produce head muscles, which are a crucial
component of the complex vertebrate head. We discuss emerging evidence for a
surprising link between the evolution of head muscles and chambered hearts - both
systems arise from a common pool of mesoderm progenitor cells within the
cardiopharyngeal field of vertebrate embryos. We consider the origin of this
field in non-vertebrate chordates and its evolution in vertebrates.

Our understanding of vertebrate origins is powerfully informed by comparative
morphology, embryology and genomics of chordates, hemichordates and echinoderms, 
which together make up the deuterostome clade. Striking body-plan differences
among these phyla have historically hindered the identification of ancestral
morphological features, but recent progress in molecular genetics and embryology 
has revealed deep similarities in body-axis formation and organization across
deuterostomes, at stages before morphological differences develop. These
developmental genetic features, along with robust support of pharyngeal gill
slits as a shared deuterostome character, provide the foundation for the
emergence of chordates.

Over the past 200 years, almost every invertebrate phylum has been proposed as a 
starting point for evolving vertebrates. Most of these scenarios are outdated,
but several are still seriously considered. The short-range transition from
ancestral invertebrate chordates (similar to amphioxus and tunicates) to
vertebrates is well accepted. However, longer-range transitions leading up to the
invertebrate chordates themselves are more controversial. Opinion is divided
between the annelid and the enteropneust scenarios, predicting, respectively, a
complex or a simple ancestor for bilaterian animals. Deciding between these ideas
will be facilitated by further comparative studies of multicellular animals,
including enigmatic taxa such as xenacoelomorphs.

CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats coupled
with CRISPR-associated proteins) is a bacterial immunity system that protects
against invading phages or plasmids. In the process of CRISPR adaptation, short
pieces of DNA ('spacers') are acquired from foreign elements and integrated into 
the CRISPR array. So far, it has remained a mystery how spacers are
preferentially acquired from the foreign DNA while the self chromosome is
avoided. Here we show that spacer acquisition is replication-dependent, and that 
DNA breaks formed at stalled replication forks promote spacer acquisition.
Chromosomal hotspots of spacer acquisition were confined by Chi sites, which are 
sequence octamers highly enriched on the bacterial chromosome, suggesting that
these sites limit spacer acquisition from self DNA. We further show that the
avoidance of self is mediated by the RecBCD double-stranded DNA break repair
complex. Our results suggest that, in Escherichia coli, acquisition of new
spacers largely depends on RecBCD-mediated processing of double-stranded DNA
breaks occurring primarily at replication forks, and that the preference for
foreign DNA is achieved through the higher density of Chi sites on the self
chromosome, in combination with the higher number of forks on the foreign DNA.
This model explains the strong preference to acquire spacers both from high copy 
plasmids and from phages.

Oxytocin is important for social interactions and maternal behaviour. However,
little is known about when, where and how oxytocin modulates neural circuits to
improve social cognition. Here we show how oxytocin enables pup retrieval
behaviour in female mice by enhancing auditory cortical pup call responses.
Retrieval behaviour required the left but not right auditory cortex, was
accelerated by oxytocin in the left auditory cortex, and oxytocin receptors were 
preferentially expressed in the left auditory cortex. Neural responses to pup
calls were lateralized, with co-tuned and temporally precise excitatory and
inhibitory responses in the left cortex of maternal but not pup-naive adults.
Finally, pairing calls with oxytocin enhanced responses by balancing the
magnitude and timing of inhibition with excitation. Our results describe
fundamental synaptic mechanisms by which oxytocin increases the salience of
acoustic social stimuli. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced plasticity provides a
biological basis for lateralization of auditory cortical processing.

Tungsten isotopic evidence for disproportional late accretion to the Earth and
Moon.

Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.

Characterization of the hafnium-tungsten systematics ((182)Hf decaying to (182)W 
and emitting two electrons with a half-life of 8.9 million years) of the lunar
mantle will enable better constraints on the timescale and processes involved in 
the currently accepted giant-impact theory for the formation and evolution of the
Moon, and for testing the late-accretion hypothesis. Uniform,
terrestrial-mantle-like W isotopic compositions have been reported among
crystallization products of the lunar magma ocean. These observations were
interpreted to reflect formation of the Moon and crystallization of the lunar
magma ocean after (182)Hf was no longer extant-that is, more than about 60
million years after the Solar System formed. Here we present W isotope data for
three lunar samples that are more precise by a factor of ≥4 than those previously
reported. The new data reveal that the lunar mantle has a well-resolved (182)W
excess of 20.6 ± 5.1 parts per million (±2 standard deviations), relative to the 
modern terrestrial mantle. The offset between the mantles of the Moon and the
modern Earth is best explained by assuming that the W isotopic compositions of
the two bodies were identical immediately following formation of the Moon, and
that they then diverged as a result of disproportional late accretion to the
Earth and Moon. One implication of this model is that metal from the core of the 
Moon-forming impactor must have efficiently stripped the Earth's mantle of highly
siderophile elements on its way to merge with the terrestrial core, requiring a
substantial, but still poorly defined, level of metal-silicate equilibration.

The TRPA1 ion channel (also known as the wasabi receptor) is a detector of
noxious chemical agents encountered in our environment or produced endogenously
during tissue injury or drug metabolism. These include a broad class of
electrophiles that activate the channel through covalent protein modification.
TRPA1 antagonists hold potential for treating neurogenic inflammatory conditions 
provoked or exacerbated by irritant exposure. Despite compelling reasons to
understand TRPA1 function, structural mechanisms underlying channel regulation
remain obscure. Here we use single-particle electron cryo- microscopy to
determine the structure of full-length human TRPA1 to ∼4 Å resolution in the
presence of pharmacophores, including a potent antagonist. Several unexpected
features are revealed, including an extensive coiled-coil assembly domain
stabilized by polyphosphate co-factors and a highly integrated nexus that
converges on an unpredicted transient receptor potential (TRP)-like allosteric
domain. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of TRPA1
regulation, and establish a blueprint for structure-based design of analgesic and
anti-inflammatory agents.

Lunar tungsten isotopic evidence for the late veneer.

According to the most widely accepted theory of lunar origin, a giant impact on
the Earth led to the formation of the Moon, and also initiated the final stage of
the formation of the Earth's core. Core formation should have removed the highly 
siderophile elements (HSE) from Earth's primitive mantle (that is, the bulk
silicate Earth), yet HSE abundances are higher than expected. One explanation for
this overabundance is that a 'late veneer' of primitive material was added to the
bulk silicate Earth after the core formed. To test this hypothesis, tungsten
isotopes are useful for two reasons: first, because the late veneer material had 
a different (182)W/(184)W ratio to that of the bulk silicate Earth, and second,
proportionally more material was added to the Earth than to the Moon. Thus, if a 
late veneer did occur, the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon must have different
(182)W/(184)W ratios. Moreover, the Moon-forming impact would also have created
(182)W differences because the mantle and core material of the impactor with
distinct (182)W/(184)W would have mixed with the proto-Earth during the giant
impact. However the (182)W/(184)W of the Moon has not been determined precisely
enough to identify signatures of a late veneer or the giant impact. Here, using
more-precise measurement techniques, we show that the Moon exhibits a (182)W
excess of 27 ± 4 parts per million over the present-day bulk silicate Earth. This
excess is consistent with the expected (182)W difference resulting from a late
veneer with a total mass and composition inferred from HSE systematics. Thus, our
data independently show that HSE abundances in the bulk silicate Earth were
established after the giant impact and core formation, as predicted by the late
veneer hypothesis. But, unexpectedly, we find that before the late veneer, no
(182)W anomaly existed between the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon, even though 
one should have arisen through the giant impact. The origin of the homogeneous
(182)W of the pre-late-veneer bulk silicate Earth and the Moon is enigmatic and
constitutes a challenge to current models of lunar origin.

Most molecular clouds are filamentary or elongated. For those forming low-mass
stars (<8 solar masses), the competition between self-gravity and turbulent
pressure along the dynamically dominant intercloud magnetic field (10 to 100
parsecs) shapes the clouds to be elongated either perpendicularly or parallel to 
the fields. A recent study also suggested that on the scales of 0.1 to 0.01
parsecs, such fields are dynamically important within cloud cores forming massive
stars (>8 solar masses). But whether the core field morphologies are inherited
from the intercloud medium or governed by cloud turbulence is unknown, as is the 
effect of magnetic fields on cloud fragmentation at scales of 10 to 0.1 parsecs. 
Here we report magnetic-field maps inferred from polarimetric observations of NGC
6334, a region forming massive stars, on the 100 to 0.01 parsec scale. NGC 6334
hosts young star-forming sites where fields are not severely affected by stellar 
feedback, and their directions do not change much over the entire scale range.
This means that the fields are dynamically important. The ordered fields lead to 
a self-similar gas fragmentation: at all scales, there exist elongated gas
structures nearly perpendicular to the fields. Many gas elongations have density 
peaks near the ends, which symmetrically pinch the fields. The field strength is 
proportional to the 0.4th power of the density, which is an indication of
anisotropic gas contractions along the field. We conclude that magnetic fields
have a crucial role in the fragmentation of NGC 6334.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for the lifelong production of
blood cells. The accumulation of DNA damage in HSCs is a hallmark of ageing and
is probably a major contributing factor in age-related tissue degeneration and
malignant transformation. A number of accelerated ageing syndromes are associated
with defective DNA repair and genomic instability, including the most common
inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, Fanconi anaemia. However, the
physiological source of DNA damage in HSCs from both normal and diseased
individuals remains unclear. Here we show in mice that DNA damage is a direct
consequence of inducing HSCs to exit their homeostatic quiescent state in
response to conditions that model physiological stress, such as infection or
chronic blood loss. Repeated activation of HSCs out of their dormant state
provoked the attrition of normal HSCs and, in the case of mice with a
non-functional Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway, led to a complete collapse of 
the haematopoietic system, which phenocopied the highly penetrant bone marrow
failure seen in Fanconi anaemia patients. Our findings establish a novel link
between physiological stress and DNA damage in normal HSCs and provide a
mechanistic explanation for the universal accumulation of DNA damage in HSCs
during ageing and the accelerated failure of the haematopoietic system in Fanconi
anaemia patients.

Single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently made significant
progress in high-resolution structure determination of macromolecular complexes
due to improvements in electron microscopic instrumentation and computational
image analysis. However, cryo-EM structures can be highly non-uniform in local
resolution and all structures available to date have been limited to resolutions 
above 3 Å. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the 70S ribosome from
Escherichia coli in complex with elongation factor Tu, aminoacyl-tRNA and the
antibiotic kirromycin at 2.65-2.9 Å resolution using spherical aberration
(Cs)-corrected cryo-EM. Overall, the cryo-EM reconstruction at 2.9 Å resolution
is comparable to the best-resolved X-ray structure of the E. coli 70S ribosome
(2.8 Å), but provides more detailed information (2.65 Å) at the functionally
important ribosomal core. The cryo-EM map elucidates for the first time the
structure of all 35 rRNA modifications in the bacterial ribosome, explaining
their roles in fine-tuning ribosome structure and function and modulating the
action of antibiotics. We also obtained atomic models for flexible parts of the
ribosome such as ribosomal proteins L9 and L31. The refined cryo-EM-based model
presents the currently most complete high-resolution structure of the E. coli
ribosome, which demonstrates the power of cryo-EM in structure determination of
large and dynamic macromolecular complexes.

Enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression and impart cell-specific
transcriptional outputs that drive cell identity. Super-enhancers (SEs), also
known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for
genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells
are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Here we analysed maps of mouse
T-cell SEs as a non-biased means of identifying key regulatory nodes involved in 
cell specification. We found that cytokines and cytokine receptors were the
dominant class of genes exhibiting SE architecture in T cells. Nonetheless, the
locus encoding Bach2, a key negative regulator of effector differentiation,
emerged as the most prominent T-cell SE, revealing a network in which
SE-associated genes critical for T-cell biology are repressed by BACH2.
Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms for immune-mediated disorders,
including rheumatoid arthritis, were highly enriched for T-cell SEs versus
typical enhancers or SEs in other cell lineages. Intriguingly, treatment of T
cells with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib disproportionately
altered the expression of rheumatoid arthritis risk genes with SE structures.
Together, these results indicate that genes with SE architecture in T cells
encompass a variety of cytokines and cytokine receptors but are controlled by a
'guardian' transcription factor, itself endowed with an SE. Thus, enumeration of 
SEs allows the unbiased determination of key regulatory nodes in T cells, which
are preferentially modulated by pharmacological intervention.

Autophagy, an important catabolic pathway implicated in a broad spectrum of human
diseases, begins by forming double membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic 
cargo and ends by fusing autophagosomes with lysosomes for degradation. Membrane 
fusion activity is required for early biogenesis of autophagosomes and late
degradation in lysosomes. However, the key regulatory mechanisms of autophagic
membrane tethering and fusion remain largely unknown. Here we report that ATG14
(also known as beclin-1-associated autophagy-related key regulator (Barkor) or
ATG14L), an essential autophagy-specific regulator of the class III
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, promotes membrane tethering of
protein-free liposomes, and enhances hemifusion and full fusion of
proteoliposomes reconstituted with the target (t)-SNAREs (soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) syntaxin 17
(STX17) and SNAP29, and the vesicle (v)-SNARE VAMP8 (vesicle-associated membrane 
protein 8). ATG14 binds to the SNARE core domain of STX17 through its coiled-coil
domain, and stabilizes the STX17-SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on autophagosomes.
The STX17 binding, membrane tethering and fusion-enhancing activities of ATG14
require its homo-oligomerization by cysteine repeats. In ATG14
homo-oligomerization-defective cells, autophagosomes still efficiently form but
their fusion with endolysosomes is blocked. Recombinant ATG14
homo-oligomerization mutants also completely lose their ability to promote
membrane tethering and to enhance SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro. Taken together,
our data suggest an autophagy-specific membrane fusion mechanism in which
oligomeric ATG14 directly binds to STX17-SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on
autophagosomes and primes it for VAMP8 interaction to promote
autophagosome-endolysosome fusion.

Rising temperatures and lessening fresh water supplies are threatening
agricultural productivity and have motivated efforts to improve plant water use
and drought tolerance. During water deficit, plants produce elevated levels of
abscisic acid (ABA), which improves water consumption and stress tolerance by
controlling guard cell aperture and other protective responses. One attractive
strategy for controlling water use is to develop compounds that activate ABA
receptors, but agonists approved for use have yet to be developed. In principle, 
an engineered ABA receptor that can be activated by an existing agrochemical
could achieve this goal. Here we describe a variant of the ABA receptor
PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE 1 (PYR1) that possesses nanomolar sensitivity to the
agrochemical mandipropamid and demonstrate its efficacy for controlling ABA
responses and drought tolerance in transgenic plants. Furthermore,
crystallographic studies provide a mechanistic basis for its activity and
demonstrate the relative ease with which the PYR1 ligand-binding pocket can be
altered to accommodate new ligands. Thus, we have successfully repurposed an
agrochemical for a new application using receptor engineering. We anticipate that
this strategy will be applied to other plant receptors and represents a new
avenue for crop improvement.

The platyrrhine primates, or New World monkeys, are immigrant mammals whose
fossil record comes from Tertiary and Quaternary sediments of South America and
the Caribbean Greater Antilles. The time and place of platyrrhine origins are
some of the most controversial issues in primate palaeontology, although an
African Palaeogene ancestry has been presumed by most primatologists. Until now, 
the oldest fossil records of New World monkeys have come from Salla, Bolivia, and
date to approximately 26 million years ago, or the Late Oligocene epoch. Here we 
report the discovery of new primates from the ?Late Eocene epoch of Amazonian
Peru, which extends the fossil record of primates in South America back
approximately 10 million years. The new specimens are important for understanding
the origin and early evolution of modern platyrrhine primates because they bear
little resemblance to any extinct or living South American primate, but they do
bear striking resemblances to Eocene African anthropoids, and our phylogenetic
analysis suggests a relationship with African taxa. The discovery of these new
primates brings the first appearance datum of caviomorph rodents and primates in 
South America back into close correspondence, but raises new questions about the 
timing and means of arrival of these two mammalian groups.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is normally present at thousands of copies per cell and
is packaged into several hundred higher-order structures termed nucleoids. The
abundant mtDNA-binding protein TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial)
regulates nucleoid architecture, abundance and segregation. Complete mtDNA
depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation, triggering
calcium-dependent stress signalling and adaptive metabolic responses. However,
the cellular responses to mtDNA instability, a physiologically relevant stress
observed in many human diseases and ageing, remain poorly defined. Here we show
that moderate mtDNA stress elicited by TFAM deficiency engages cytosolic
antiviral signalling to enhance the expression of a subset of
interferon-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, we find that aberrant mtDNA
packaging promotes escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA
sensor cGAS (also known as MB21D1) and promotes STING (also known as
TMEM173)-IRF3-dependent signalling to elevate interferon-stimulated gene
expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral
resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress,
which enhances antiviral signalling and type I interferon responses during
infection. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondria are central
participants in innate immunity, identify mtDNA stress as a cell-intrinsic
trigger of antiviral signalling and suggest that cellular monitoring of mtDNA
homeostasis cooperates with canonical virus sensing mechanisms to fully engage
antiviral innate immunity.

The enzyme hydrogenase reversibly converts dihydrogen to protons and electrons at
a metal catalyst. The location of the abundant hydrogens is of key importance for
understanding structure and function of the protein. However, in protein X-ray
crystallography the detection of hydrogen atoms is one of the major problems,
since they display only weak contributions to diffraction and the quality of the 
single crystals is often insufficient to obtain sub-ångström resolution. Here we 
report the crystal structure of a standard [NiFe] hydrogenase (∼91.3 kDa
molecular mass) at 0.89 Å resolution. The strictly anoxically isolated
hydrogenase has been obtained in a specific spectroscopic state, the active
reduced Ni-R (subform Ni-R1) state. The high resolution, proper refinement
strategy and careful modelling allow the positioning of a large part of the
hydrogen atoms in the structure. This has led to the direct detection of the
products of the heterolytic splitting of dihydrogen into a hydride (H(-))
bridging the Ni and Fe and a proton (H(+)) attached to the sulphur of a cysteine 
ligand. The Ni-H(-) and Fe-H(-) bond lengths are 1.58 Å and 1.78Å, respectively. 
Furthermore, we can assign the Fe-CO and Fe-CN(-) ligands at the active site, and
can obtain the hydrogen-bond networks and the preferred proton transfer pathway
in the hydrogenase. Our results demonstrate the precise comprehensive information
available from ultra-high-resolution structures of proteins as an alternative to 
neutron diffraction and other methods such as NMR structural analysis.

A Mercury-like component of early Earth yields uranium in the core and high
mantle (142)Nd.

Recent (142)Nd isotope data indicate that the silicate Earth (its crust plus the 
mantle) has a samarium to neodymium elemental ratio (Sm/Nd) that is greater than 
that of the supposed chondritic building blocks of the planet. This elevated
Sm/Nd has been ascribed either to a 'hidden' reservoir in the Earth or to loss of
an early-formed terrestrial crust by impact ablation. Since removal of crust by
ablation would also remove the heat-producing elements--potassium, uranium and
thorium--such removal would make it extremely difficult to balance terrestrial
heat production with the observed heat flow. In the 'hidden' reservoir
alternative, a complementary low-Sm/Nd layer is usually considered to reside
unobserved in the silicate lower mantle. We have previously shown, however, that 
the core is a likely reservoir for some lithophile elements such as niobium. We
therefore address the question of whether core formation could have fractionated 
Nd from Sm and also acted as a sink for heat-producing elements. We show here
that addition of a reduced Mercury-like body (or, alternatively, an
enstatite-chondrite-like body) rich in sulfur to the early Earth would generate a
superchondritic Sm/Nd in the mantle and an (142)Nd/(144)Nd anomaly of
approximately +14 parts per million relative to chondrite. In addition, the
sulfur-rich core would partition uranium strongly and thorium slightly, supplying
a substantial part of the 'missing' heat source for the geodynamo.

Abrupt climate change is a ubiquitous feature of the Late Pleistocene epoch. In
particular, the sequence of Dansgaard-Oeschger events (repeated transitions
between warm interstadial and cold stadial conditions), as recorded by ice cores 
in Greenland, are thought to be linked to changes in the mode of overturning
circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, the observed correspondence between 
North Atlantic cold events and increased iceberg calving and dispersal from ice
sheets surrounding the North Atlantic has inspired many ocean and climate
modelling studies that make use of freshwater forcing scenarios to simulate
abrupt change across the North Atlantic region and beyond. On the other hand,
previous studies identified an apparent lag between North Atlantic cooling events
and the appearance of ice-rafted debris over the last glacial cycle, leading to
the hypothesis that iceberg discharge may be a consequence of stadial conditions 
rather than the cause. Here we further establish this relationship and
demonstrate a systematic delay between pronounced surface cooling and the arrival
of ice-rafted debris at a site southwest of Iceland over the past four glacial
cycles, implying that in general icebergs arrived too late to have triggered
cooling. Instead we suggest that--on the basis of our comparisons of ice-rafted
debris and polar planktonic foraminifera--abrupt transitions to stadial
conditions should be considered as a nonlinear response to more gradual cooling
across the North Atlantic. Although the freshwater derived from melting icebergs 
may provide a positive feedback for enhancing and or prolonging stadial
conditions, it does not trigger northern stadial events.

Chemical manufacturing is conducted using either batch systems or continuous-flow
systems. Flow systems have several advantages over batch systems, particularly in
terms of productivity, heat and mixing efficiency, safety, and reproducibility.
However, for over half a century, pharmaceutical manufacturing has used batch
systems because the synthesis of complex molecules such as drugs has been
difficult to achieve with continuous-flow systems. Here we describe the
continuous-flow synthesis of drugs using only columns packed with heterogeneous
catalysts. Commercially available starting materials were successively passed
through four columns containing achiral and chiral heterogeneous catalysts to
produce (R)-rolipram, an anti-inflammatory drug and one of the family of
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives. In addition, simply by replacing a column
packed with a chiral heterogeneous catalyst with another column packed with the
opposing enantiomer, we obtained antipole (S)-rolipram. Similarly, we also
synthesized (R)-phenibut, another drug belonging to the GABA family. These flow
systems are simple and stable with no leaching of metal catalysts. Our results
demonstrate that multistep (eight steps in this case) chemical transformations
for drug synthesis can proceed smoothly under flow conditions using only
heterogeneous catalysts, without the isolation of any intermediates and without
the separation of any catalysts, co-products, by-products, and excess reagents.
We anticipate that such syntheses will be useful in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

Continuing degradation of coral reef ecosystems has generated substantial
interest in how management can support reef resilience. Fishing is the primary
source of diminished reef function globally, leading to widespread calls for
additional marine reserves to recover fish biomass and restore key ecosystem
functions. Yet there are no established baselines for determining when these
conservation objectives have been met or whether alternative management
strategies provide similar ecosystem benefits. Here we establish empirical
conservation benchmarks and fish biomass recovery timelines against which coral
reefs can be assessed and managed by studying the recovery potential of more than
800 coral reefs along an exploitation gradient. We show that resident reef fish
biomass in the absence of fishing (B0) averages ∼1,000 kg ha(-1), and that the
vast majority (83%) of fished reefs are missing more than half their expected
biomass, with severe consequences for key ecosystem functions such as predation. 
Given protection from fishing, reef fish biomass has the potential to recover
within 35 years on average and less than 60 years when heavily depleted. Notably,
alternative fisheries restrictions are largely (64%) successful at maintaining
biomass above 50% of B0, sustaining key functions such as herbivory. Our results 
demonstrate that crucial ecosystem functions can be maintained through a range of
fisheries restrictions, allowing coral reef managers to develop recovery plans
that meet conservation and livelihood objectives in areas where marine reserves
are not socially or politically feasible solutions.

Adiponectin stimulation of its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, increases the
activities of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), respectively, thereby contributing to
healthy longevity as key anti-diabetic molecules. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were
predicted to contain seven transmembrane helices with the opposite topology to
G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we report the crystal structures of human
AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 at 2.9 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, which represent a 
novel class of receptor structure. The seven-transmembrane helices,
conformationally distinct from those of G-protein-coupled receptors, enclose a
large cavity where three conserved histidine residues coordinate a zinc ion. The 
zinc-binding structure may have a role in the adiponectin-stimulated AMPK
phosphorylation and UCP2 upregulation. Adiponectin may broadly interact with the 
extracellular face, rather than the carboxy-terminal tail, of the receptors. The 
present information will facilitate the understanding of novel structure-function
relationships and the development and optimization of AdipoR agonists for the
treatment of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.

Cancer cells adapt their metabolic processes to support rapid proliferation, but 
less is known about how cancer cells alter metabolism to promote cell survival in
a poorly vascularized tumour microenvironment. Here we identify a key role for
serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the
ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are
highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We
find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen
consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival
advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs
cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be
converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is
required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders
these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition.

Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to
intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and
colonize secondary sites. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within
complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary
lesions. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity,
and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization,
for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic
populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature
systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression
profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two
secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to
program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins
not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their
perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives
the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while
simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the 
vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell
lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were
overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. 
Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly
relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer.

The development of new rechargeable battery systems could fuel various energy
applications, from personal electronics to grid storage. Rechargeable
aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low
flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high
capacity. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered
numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration, low cell discharge
voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge
voltage plateaus (1.1-0.2 volts or 1.8-0.8 volts) and insufficient cycle life
(less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26-85 per cent over 100
cycles). Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate
capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional
graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical
deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and
intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a
non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge 
voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g(-1) and a
Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to
enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around
one minute with a current density of ~4,000 mA g(-1) (equivalent to
~3,000 W kg(-1)), and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.

Cancers emerge from an ongoing Darwinian evolutionary process, often leading to
multiple competing subclones within a single primary tumour. This evolutionary
process culminates in the formation of metastases, which is the cause of 90% of
cancer-related deaths. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known 
about the principles governing the dissemination of cancer cells to distant
organs. Although the hypothesis that each metastasis originates from a single
tumour cell is generally supported, recent studies using mouse models of cancer
demonstrated the existence of polyclonal seeding from and interclonal cooperation
between multiple subclones. Here we sought definitive evidence for the existence 
of polyclonal seeding in human malignancy and to establish the clonal
relationship among different metastases in the context of androgen-deprived
metastatic prostate cancer. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized
multiple metastases arising from prostate tumours in ten patients. Integrated
analyses of subclonal architecture revealed the patterns of metastatic spread in 
unprecedented detail. Metastasis-to-metastasis spread was found to be common,
either through de novo monoclonal seeding of daughter metastases or, in five
cases, through the transfer of multiple tumour clones between metastatic sites.
Lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur as single events, whereas
mutations in genes involved in androgen receptor signalling commonly involve
multiple, convergent events in different metastases. Our results elucidate in
detail the complex patterns of metastatic spread and further our understanding of
the development of resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.

In response to adenosine 5'-diphosphate, the P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) facilitates
platelet aggregation, and thus serves as an important antithrombotic drug target.
Here we report the crystal structures of the human P2Y1R in complex with a
nucleotide antagonist MRS2500 at 2.7 Å resolution, and with a non-nucleotide
antagonist BPTU at 2.2 Å resolution. The structures reveal two distinct
ligand-binding sites, providing atomic details of P2Y1R's unique ligand-binding
modes. MRS2500 recognizes a binding site within the seven transmembrane bundle of
P2Y1R, which is different in shape and location from the nucleotide binding site 
in the previously determined structure of P2Y12R, representative of another P2YR 
subfamily. BPTU binds to an allosteric pocket on the external receptor interface 
with the lipid bilayer, making it the first structurally characterized selective 
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand located entirely outside of the helical 
bundle. These high-resolution insights into P2Y1R should enable discovery of new 
orthosteric and allosteric antithrombotic drugs with reduced adverse effects.

Drug resistance invariably limits the clinical efficacy of targeted therapy with 
kinase inhibitors against cancer. Here we show that targeted therapy with BRAF,
ALK or EGFR kinase inhibitors induces a complex network of secreted signals in
drug-stressed human and mouse melanoma and human lung adenocarcinoma cells. This 
therapy-induced secretome stimulates the outgrowth, dissemination and metastasis 
of drug-resistant cancer cell clones and supports the survival of drug-sensitive 
cancer cells, contributing to incomplete tumour regression. The tumour-promoting 
secretome of melanoma cells treated with the kinase inhibitor vemurafenib is
driven by downregulation of the transcription factor FRA1. In situ transcriptome 
analysis of drug-resistant melanoma cells responding to the regressing tumour
microenvironment revealed hyperactivation of several signalling pathways, most
prominently the AKT pathway. Dual inhibition of RAF and the PI(3)K/AKT/mTOR
intracellular signalling pathways blunted the outgrowth of the drug-resistant
cell population in BRAF mutant human melanoma, suggesting this combination
therapy as a strategy against tumour relapse. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of
oncogenic drivers induces vast secretome changes in drug-sensitive cancer cells, 
paradoxically establishing a tumour microenvironment that supports the expansion 
of drug-resistant clones, but is susceptible to combination therapy.

CK Vulpeculae was observed in outburst in 1670-1672 (ref. 1), but no counterpart 
was seen until 1982, when a bipolar nebula was found at its location.
Historically, CK Vul has been considered to be a nova (Nova Vul 1670), but its
similarity to 'red transients', which are more luminous than classical novae and 
thought to be the results of stellar collisions, has re-opened the question of
CK Vul's status. Red transients cool to resemble late M-type stars, surrounded by
circumstellar material rich in molecules and dust. No stellar source has been
seen in CK Vul, though a radio continuum source was identified at the expansion
centre of the nebula. Here we report that CK Vul is surrounded by chemically rich
molecular gas in the form of an outflow, as well as dust. The gas has peculiar
isotopic ratios, revealing that CK Vul's composition was strongly enhanced by the
nuclear ashes of hydrogen burning. The chemical composition cannot be reconciled 
with a nova or indeed any other known explosion. In addition, the mass of the
surrounding gas is too large for a nova, though the conversion from observations 
of CO to a total mass is uncertain. We conclude that CK Vul is best explained as 
the remnant of a merger of two stars.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors result in impressive clinical responses, but optimal
results will require combination with each other and other therapies. This raises
fundamental questions about mechanisms of non-redundancy and resistance. Here we 
report major tumour regressions in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma 
treated with an anti-CTLA4 antibody (anti-CTLA4) and radiation, and reproduced
this effect in mouse models. Although combined treatment improved responses in
irradiated and unirradiated tumours, resistance was common. Unbiased analyses of 
mice revealed that resistance was due to upregulation of PD-L1 on melanoma cells 
and associated with T-cell exhaustion. Accordingly, optimal response in melanoma 
and other cancer types requires radiation, anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-L1/PD-1.
Anti-CTLA4 predominantly inhibits T-regulatory cells (Treg cells), thereby
increasing the CD8 T-cell to Treg (CD8/Treg) ratio. Radiation enhances the
diversity of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of intratumoral T cells.
Together, anti-CTLA4 promotes expansion of T cells, while radiation shapes the
TCR repertoire of the expanded peripheral clones. Addition of PD-L1 blockade
reverses T-cell exhaustion to mitigate depression in the CD8/Treg ratio and
further encourages oligoclonal T-cell expansion. Similarly to results from mice, 
patients on our clinical trial with melanoma showing high PD-L1 did not respond
to radiation plus anti-CTLA4, demonstrated persistent T-cell exhaustion, and
rapidly progressed. Thus, PD-L1 on melanoma cells allows tumours to escape
anti-CTLA4-based therapy, and the combination of radiation, anti-CTLA4 and
anti-PD-L1 promotes response and immunity through distinct mechanisms.

biosynthesis.

Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are giant enzymes composed of modules that
house repeated sets of functional domains, which select, activate and couple
amino acids drawn from a pool of nearly 500 potential building blocks. The
structurally and stereochemically diverse peptides generated in this manner
underlie the biosynthesis of a large sector of natural products. Many of their
derived metabolites are bioactive such as the antibiotics vancomycin, bacitracin,
daptomycin and the β-lactam-containing penicillins, cephalosporins and
nocardicins. Penicillins and cephalosporins are synthesized from a classically
derived non-ribosomal peptide synthetase tripeptide (from
δ-(L-α-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase). Here we report an
unprecedented non-ribosomal peptide synthetase activity that both assembles a
serine-containing peptide and mediates its cyclization to the critical β-lactam
ring of the nocardicin family of antibiotics. A histidine-rich condensation
domain, which typically performs peptide bond formation during product assembly, 
also synthesizes the embedded four-membered ring. We propose a mechanism, and
describe supporting experiments, that is distinct from the pathways that have
evolved to the three other β-lactam antibiotic families:
penicillin/cephalosporins, clavams and carbapenems. These findings raise the
possibility that β-lactam rings can be regio- and stereospecifically integrated
into engineered peptides for application as, for example, targeted protease
inactivators.

Infectious agents develop intricate mechanisms to interact with host cell
pathways and hijack their genetic and epigenetic machinery to change host cell
phenotypic states. Among the Apicomplexa phylum of obligate intracellular
parasites, which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only genus
that transforms its mammalian host cells. Theileria infection of bovine
leukocytes induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with
activated signalling pathways, notably JNK and AP-1 (ref. 2). The transformed
phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the theilericidal drug buparvaquone. We
used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the peptidyl-prolyl
isomerase PIN1 in T. annulata (TaPIN1) that is secreted into the host cell and
modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPIN1 is a bona fide 
prolyl isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7,
leading to its degradation and subsequent stabilization of c-JUN, which promotes 
transformation. We performed in vitro and in silico analysis and in vivo
zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPIN1 is directly inhibited 
by the anti-parasite drug buparvaquone (and other known PIN1 inhibitors) and is
mutated in a drug-resistant strain. Prolyl isomerization is thus a conserved
mechanism that is important in cancer and is used by Theileria parasites to
manipulate host oncogenic signalling.

Thirst is the basic instinct to drink water. Previously, it was shown that
neurons in several circumventricular organs of the hypothalamus are activated by 
thirst-inducing conditions. Here we identify two distinct, genetically separable 
neural populations in the subfornical organ that trigger or suppress thirst. We
show that optogenetic activation of subfornical organ excitatory neurons, marked 
by the expression of the transcription factor ETV-1, evokes intense drinking
behaviour, and does so even in fully water-satiated animals. The light-induced
response is highly specific for water, immediate and strictly locked to the laser
stimulus. In contrast, activation of a second population of subfornical organ
neurons, marked by expression of the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT, drastically
suppresses drinking, even in water-craving thirsty animals. These results reveal 
an innate brain circuit that can turn an animal's water-drinking behaviour on and
off, and probably functions as a centre for thirst control in the mammalian
brain.

Neurobiological models of long-term memory propose a mechanism by which initially
weak memories are strengthened through subsequent activation that engages common 
neural pathways minutes to hours later. This synaptic tag-and-capture model has
been hypothesized to explain how inconsequential information is selectively
consolidated following salient experiences. Behavioural evidence for
tag-and-capture is provided by rodent studies in which weak early memories are
strengthened by future behavioural training. Whether a process of behavioural
tagging occurs in humans to transform weak episodic memories into stable
long-term memories is unknown. Here we show, in humans, that information is
selectively consolidated if conceptually related information, putatively
represented in a common neural substrate, is made salient through an emotional
learning experience. Memory for neutral objects was selectively enhanced if other
objects from the same category were paired with shock. Retroactive enhancements
as a result of emotional learning were observed following a period of
consolidation, but were not observed in an immediate memory test or for items
strongly encoded before fear conditioning. These findings provide new evidence
for a generalized retroactive memory enhancement, whereby inconsequential
information can be retroactively credited as relevant, and therefore selectively 
remembered, if conceptually related information acquires salience in the future.

The main organelles of the secretory and endocytic pathways--the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and endosomes, respectively--are connected through contact sites
whose numbers increase as endosomes mature. One function of such sites is to
enable dephosphorylation of the cytosolic tails of endosomal signalling receptors
by an ER-associated phosphatase, whereas others serve to negatively control the
association of endosomes with the minus-end-directed microtubule motor dynein or 
mediate endosome fission. Cholesterol transfer and Ca(2+) exchange have been
proposed as additional functions of such sites. However, the compositions,
activities and regulations of ER-endosome contact sites remain incompletely
understood. Here we show in human and rat cell lines that protrudin, an ER
protein that promotes protrusion and neurite outgrowth, forms contact sites with 
late endosomes (LEs) via coincident detection of the small GTPase RAB7 and
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). These contact sites mediate
transfer of the microtubule motor kinesin 1 from protrudin to the motor adaptor
FYCO1 on LEs. Repeated LE-ER contacts promote microtubule-dependent translocation
of LEs to the cell periphery and subsequent synaptotagmin-VII-dependent fusion
with the plasma membrane. Such fusion induces outgrowth of protrusions and
neurites, which requires the abilities of protrudin and FYCO1 to interact with
LEs and kinesin 1. Thus, protrudin-containing ER-LE contact sites are platforms
for kinesin-1 loading onto LEs, and kinesin-1-mediated translocation of LEs to
the plasma membrane, fuelled by repeated ER contacts, promotes protrusion and
neurite outgrowth.

Most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system can be explained by a collision
between a planetary embryo (giant impactor) and the growing Earth late in the
accretion process. Simulations show that most of the material that eventually
aggregates to form the Moon originates from the impactor. However, analysis of
the terrestrial and lunar isotopic compositions show them to be highly similar.
In contrast, the compositions of other Solar System bodies are significantly
different from those of the Earth and Moon, suggesting that different Solar
System bodies have distinct compositions. This challenges the giant impact
scenario, because the Moon-forming impactor must then also be thought to have a
composition different from that of the proto-Earth. Here we track the feeding
zones of growing planets in a suite of simulations of planetary accretion, to
measure the composition of Moon-forming impactors. We find that different planets
formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of
giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact. A
large fraction of planet-impactor pairs have almost identical compositions. Thus,
the similarity in composition between the Earth and Moon could be a natural
consequence of a late giant impact.

The chemical properties of an element are primarily governed by the configuration
of electrons in the valence shell. Relativistic effects influence the electronic 
structure of heavy elements in the sixth row of the periodic table, and these
effects increase dramatically in the seventh row--including the actinides--even
affecting ground-state configurations. Atomic s and p1/2 orbitals are stabilized 
by relativistic effects, whereas p3/2, d and f orbitals are destabilized, so that
ground-state configurations of heavy elements may differ from those of lighter
elements in the same group. The first ionization potential (IP1) is a measure of 
the energy required to remove one valence electron from a neutral atom, and is an
atomic property that reflects the outermost electronic configuration. Precise and
accurate experimental determination of IP1 gives information on the binding
energy of valence electrons, and also, therefore, on the degree of relativistic
stabilization. However, such measurements are hampered by the difficulty in
obtaining the heaviest elements on scales of more than one atom at a time. Here
we report that the experimentally obtained IP1 of the heaviest actinide,
lawrencium (Lr, atomic number 103), is 4.96(+0.08)(-0.07) electronvolts. The IP1 
of Lr was measured with (256)Lr (half-life 27 seconds) using an efficient surface
ion-source and a radioisotope detection system coupled to a mass separator. The
measured IP1 is in excellent agreement with the value of 4.963(15) electronvolts 
predicted here by state-of-the-art relativistic calculations. The present work
provides a reliable benchmark for theoretical calculations and also opens the way
for IP1 measurements of superheavy elements (that is, transactinides) on an
atom-at-a-time scale.

Four-wave mixing (FWM) processes, based on third-order nonlinear light-matter
interactions, can combine ultrafast time resolution with energy and wavevector
selectivity, and enable the exploration of dynamics inaccessible by linear
methods. The coherent and multi-wave nature of the FWM approach has been crucial 
in the development of advanced technologies, such as silicon photonics,
subwavelength imaging and quantum communications. All these technologies operate 
at optical wavelengths, which limits the spatial resolution and does not allow
the probing of excitations with energy in the electronvolt range. Extension to
shorter wavelengths--that is, the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray
ranges--would allow the spatial resolution to be improved and the excitation
energy range to be expanded, as well as enabling elemental selectivity to be
achieved by exploiting core resonances. So far, FWM applications at such
wavelengths have been prevented by the absence of coherent sources of sufficient 
brightness and of suitable experimental set-ups. Here we show how transient
gratings, generated by the interference of coherent extreme-ultraviolet pulses
delivered by the FERMI free-electron laser, can be used to stimulate FWM
processes at suboptical wavelengths. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the
possibility of observing the time evolution of the FWM signal, which shows the
dynamics of coherent excitations as molecular vibrations. This result opens the
way to FWM with nanometre spatial resolution and elemental selectivity, which,
for example, would enable the investigation of charge-transfer dynamics. The
theoretical possibility of realizing these applications has already stimulated
ongoing developments of free-electron lasers: our results show that FWM at
suboptical wavelengths is feasible, and we hope that they will enable advances in
present and future photon sources.

Observations of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our 
planetary system was rich in water and organic molecules. Bombardment brought
these organics to the young Earth's surface. Unlike asteroids, comets preserve a 
nearly pristine record of the solar nebula composition. The presence of cyanides 
in comets, including 0.01 per cent of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) with respect to
water, is of special interest because of the importance of C-N bonds for abiotic 
amino acid synthesis. Comet-like compositions of simple and complex volatiles are
found in protostars, and can readily be explained by a combination of gas-phase
chemistry (to form, for example, HCN) and an active ice-phase chemistry on grain 
surfaces that advances complexity. Simple volatiles, including water and HCN,
have been detected previously in solar nebula analogues, indicating that they
survive disk formation or are re-formed in situ. It has hitherto been unclear
whether the same holds for more complex organic molecules outside the solar
nebula, given that recent observations show a marked change in the chemistry at
the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due to accretion shocks.
Here we report the detection of the complex cyanides CH3CN and HC3N (and HCN) in 
the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480. We find that the abundance
ratios of these nitrogen-bearing organics in the gas phase are similar to those
in comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides
in the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles
in protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of our solar nebula 
was not unique.

Large quantities of organic carbon are stored in frozen soils (permafrost) within
Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. A warming climate can induce environmental changes
that accelerate the microbial breakdown of organic carbon and the release of the 
greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane. This feedback can accelerate climate
change, but the magnitude and timing of greenhouse gas emission from these
regions and their impact on climate change remain uncertain. Here we find that
current evidence suggests a gradual and prolonged release of greenhouse gas
emissions in a warming climate and present a research strategy with which to
target poorly understood aspects of permafrost carbon dynamics.

The metabolism of endothelial cells during vessel sprouting remains poorly
studied. Here we report that endothelial loss of CPT1A, a rate-limiting enzyme of
fatty acid oxidation (FAO), causes vascular sprouting defects due to impaired
proliferation, not migration, of human and murine endothelial cells. Reduction of
FAO in endothelial cells did not cause energy depletion or disturb redox
homeostasis, but impaired de novo nucleotide synthesis for DNA replication.
Isotope labelling studies in control endothelial cells showed that fatty acid
carbons substantially replenished the Krebs cycle, and were incorporated into
aspartate (a nucleotide precursor), uridine monophosphate (a precursor of
pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates) and DNA. CPT1A silencing reduced these
processes and depleted endothelial cell stores of aspartate and
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Acetate (metabolized to acetyl-CoA, thereby
substituting for the depleted FAO-derived acetyl-CoA) or a nucleoside mix rescued
the phenotype of CPT1A-silenced endothelial cells. Finally, CPT1 blockade
inhibited pathological ocular angiogenesis in mice, suggesting a novel strategy
for blocking angiogenesis.

The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 has emerged as a versatile genome-editing
platform. However, the size of the commonly used Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes
(SpCas9) limits its utility for basic research and therapeutic applications that 
use the highly versatile adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery vehicle. Here, we 
characterize six smaller Cas9 orthologues and show that Cas9 from Staphylococcus 
aureus (SaCas9) can edit the genome with efficiencies similar to those of SpCas9,
while being more than 1 kilobase shorter. We packaged SaCas9 and its single guide
RNA expression cassette into a single AAV vector and targeted the cholesterol
regulatory gene Pcsk9 in the mouse liver. Within one week of injection, we
observed >40% gene modification, accompanied by significant reductions in serum
Pcsk9 and total cholesterol levels. We further assess the genome-wide targeting
specificity of SaCas9 and SpCas9 using BLESS, and demonstrate that
SaCas9-mediated in vivo genome editing has the potential to be efficient and
specific.

Maternal age is a risk factor for congenital heart disease even in the absence of
any chromosomal abnormality in the newborn. Whether the basis of this risk
resides with the mother or oocyte is unknown. The impact of maternal age on
congenital heart disease can be modelled in mouse pups that harbour a mutation of
the cardiac transcription factor gene Nkx2-5 (ref. 8). Here, reciprocal ovarian
transplants between young and old mothers establish a maternal basis for the
age-associated risk in mice. A high-fat diet does not accelerate the effect of
maternal ageing, so hyperglycaemia and obesity do not simply explain the
mechanism. The age-associated risk varies with the mother's strain background,
making it a quantitative genetic trait. Most remarkably, voluntary exercise,
whether begun by mothers at a young age or later in life, can mitigate the risk
when they are older. Thus, even when the offspring carry a causal mutation, an
intervention aimed at the mother can meaningfully reduce their risk of congenital
heart disease.

The brain has an extraordinary capacity for memory storage, but how it stores new
information without disrupting previously acquired memories remains unknown. Here
we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca(2+) spikes on
different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the
mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca(2+) spikes cause
long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of 
spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated,
different motor tasks frequently induce Ca(2+) spikes on the same branches. On
those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they
are active seconds before Ca(2+) spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly,
increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task
are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that
dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca(2+) spikes is crucial for establishing
long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage
associated with different learning experiences.

The alignment of Saturn's magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use 
of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period. The period was
previously determined from radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft to be
10 h 39 min 22.4 s (ref. 2). When the Cassini spacecraft measured a period of
10 h 47 min 6 s, which was additionally found to change between sequential
measurements, it became clear that the radio period could not be used to
determine the bulk planetary rotation period. Estimates based upon Saturn's
measured wind fields have increased the uncertainty even more, giving numbers
smaller than the Voyager rotation period, and at present Saturn's rotation period
is thought to be between 10 h 32 min and 10 h 47 min, which is unsatisfactory for
such a fundamental property. Here we report a period of 10 h 32 min 45 s ± 46 s, 
based upon an optimization approach using Saturn's measured gravitational field
and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles.
Moreover, even when solely using the constraints from its gravitational field,
the rotation period can be inferred with a precision of several minutes. To
validate our method, we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly
recovered its well-known rotation period.

RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the ability of exogenously introduced
double-stranded RNA to silence expression of homologous sequences. Silencing is
initiated when the enzyme Dicer processes the double-stranded RNA into small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Small RNA molecules are incorporated into
Argonaute-protein-containing effector complexes, which they guide to
complementary targets to mediate different types of gene silencing, specifically 
post-transcriptional gene silencing and chromatin-dependent gene silencing.
Although endogenous small RNAs have crucial roles in chromatin-mediated processes
across kingdoms, efforts to initiate chromatin modifications in trans by using
siRNAs have been inherently difficult to achieve in all eukaryotic cells. Using
fission yeast, here we show that RNAi-directed heterochromatin formation is
negatively controlled by the highly conserved RNA polymerase-associated factor 1 
complex (Paf1C). Temporary expression of a synthetic hairpin RNA in Paf1C mutants
triggers stable heterochromatin formation at homologous loci, effectively
silencing genes in trans. This repressed state is propagated across generations
by the continual production of secondary siRNAs, independently of the synthetic
hairpin RNA. Our data support a model in which Paf1C prevents targeting of
nascent transcripts by the siRNA-containing RNA-induced transcriptional silencing
complex and thereby epigenetic gene silencing, by promoting efficient
transcription termination and rapid release of the RNA from the site of
transcription. We show that although compromised transcription termination is
sufficient to initiate the formation of bi-stable heterochromatin by trans-acting
siRNAs, impairment of both transcription termination and nascent transcript
release is imperative to confer stability to the repressed state. Our work
uncovers a novel mechanism for small-RNA-mediated epigenome regulation and
highlights fundamental roles for Paf1C and the RNAi machinery in building
epigenetic memory.

Non-small-cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide. Chemotherapies such as the topoisomerase II (TopoII) inhibitor
etoposide effectively reduce disease in a minority of patients with this cancer; 
therefore, alternative drug targets, including epigenetic enzymes, are under
consideration for therapeutic intervention. A promising potential epigenetic
target is the methyltransferase EZH2, which in the context of the polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is well known to tri-methylate histone H3 at lysine
27 (H3K27me3) and elicit gene silencing. Here we demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition
has differential effects on the TopoII inhibitor response of non-small-cell lung 
cancers in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and BRG1 mutations are genetic biomarkers that
predict enhanced sensitivity to TopoII inhibitor in response to EZH2 inhibition. 
BRG1 loss-of-function mutant tumours respond to EZH2 inhibition with increased S 
phase, anaphase bridging, apoptosis and TopoII inhibitor sensitivity. Conversely,
EGFR and BRG1 wild-type tumours upregulate BRG1 in response to EZH2 inhibition
and ultimately become more resistant to TopoII inhibitor. EGFR gain-of-function
mutant tumours are also sensitive to dual EZH2 inhibition and TopoII inhibitor,
because of genetic antagonism between EGFR and BRG1. These findings suggest an
opportunity for precision medicine in the genetically complex disease of
non-small-cell lung cancer.

A key event in human evolution is the expansion of modern humans of African
origin across Eurasia between 60 and 40 thousand years (kyr) before present (bp),
replacing all other forms of hominins. Owing to the scarcity of human fossils
from this period, these ancestors of all present-day non-African modern
populations remain largely enigmatic. Here we describe a partial calvaria,
recently discovered at Manot Cave (Western Galilee, Israel) and dated to
54.7 ± 5.5 kyr bp (arithmetic mean ± 2 standard deviations) by uranium-thorium
dating, that sheds light on this crucial event. The overall shape and discrete
morphological features of the Manot 1 calvaria demonstrate that this partial
skull is unequivocally modern. It is similar in shape to recent African skulls as
well as to European skulls from the Upper Palaeolithic period, but different from
most other early anatomically modern humans in the Levant. This suggests that the
Manot people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later
successfully colonized Europe. Thus, the anatomical features used to support the 
'assimilation model' in Europe might not have been inherited from European
Neanderthals, but rather from earlier Levantine populations. Moreover, at
present, Manot 1 is the only modern human specimen to provide evidence that
during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic interface, both modern humans and
Neanderthals contemporaneously inhabited the southern Levant, close in time to
the likely interbreeding event with Neanderthals.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional
repression of promoters and is essential for mammalian development. Establishment
of DNA methylation is mediated by the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and
DNMT3B, whereas DNMT1 ensures maintenance of methylation through replication.
Absence of these enzymes is lethal, and somatic mutations in these genes have
been associated with several human diseases. How genomic DNA methylation patterns
are regulated remains poorly understood, as the mechanisms that guide recruitment
and activity of DNMTs in vivo are largely unknown. To gain insights into this
matter we determined genomic binding and site-specific activity of the mammalian 
de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B. We show that both enzymes
localize to methylated, CpG-dense regions in mouse stem cells, yet are excluded
from active promoters and enhancers. By specifically measuring sites of de novo
methylation, we observe that enzymatic activity reflects binding. De novo
methylation increases with CpG density, yet is excluded from nucleosomes.
Notably, we observed selective binding of DNMT3B to the bodies of transcribed
genes, which leads to their preferential methylation. This targeting to
transcribed sequences requires SETD2-mediated methylation of lysine 36 on histone
H3 and a functional PWWP domain of DNMT3B. Together these findings reveal how
sequence and chromatin cues guide de novo methyltransferase activity to ensure
methylome integrity.

The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic
influences. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to
coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can
lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic
variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide
association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the
intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals 
from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes 
of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci
with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial
volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures
rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found
for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on
volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10(-33); 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence
of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue.
Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that
regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these 
genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain
development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric
dysfunction.

Gradual accumulation of evidence is thought to be fundamental for
decision-making, and its neural correlates have been found in several brain
regions. Here we develop a generalizable method to measure tuning curves that
specify the relationship between neural responses and mentally accumulated
evidence, and apply it to distinguish the encoding of decision variables in
posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, FOF). 
We recorded the firing rates of neurons in posterior parietal cortex and FOF from
rats performing a perceptual decision-making task. Classical analyses uncovered
correlates of accumulating evidence, similar to previous observations in primates
and also similar across the two regions. However, tuning curve assays revealed
that while the posterior parietal cortex encodes a graded value of the
accumulating evidence, the FOF has a more categorical encoding that indicates,
throughout the trial, the decision provisionally favoured by the evidence
accumulated so far. Contrary to current views, this suggests that premotor
activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the accumulation process, 
but instead has a more categorical function, such as transforming accumulated
evidence into a discrete choice. To probe causally the role of FOF activity, we
optogenetically silenced it during different time points of the trial. Consistent
with a role in committing to a categorical choice at the end of the evidence
accumulation process, but not consistent with a role during the accumulation
itself, a behavioural effect was observed only when FOF silencing occurred at the
end of the perceptual stimulus. Our results place important constraints on the
circuit logic of brain regions involved in decision-making.

Transition-metal complexes have long attracted interest for fundamental chemical 
reactivity studies and possible use in solar energy conversion. Electronic
excitation, ligand loss from the metal centre, or a combination of both, creates 
changes in charge and spin density at the metal site that need to be controlled
to optimize complexes for photocatalytic hydrogen production and selective
carbon-hydrogen bond activation. An understanding at the molecular level of how
transition-metal complexes catalyse reactions, and in particular of the role of
the short-lived and reactive intermediate states involved, will be critical for
such optimization. However, suitable methods for detailed characterization of
electronic excited states have been lacking. Here we show, with the use of X-ray 
laser-based femtosecond-resolution spectroscopy and advanced quantum chemical
theory to probe the reaction dynamics of the benchmark transition-metal complex
Fe(CO)5 in solution, that the photo-induced removal of CO generates the
16-electron Fe(CO)4 species, a homogeneous catalyst with an electron deficiency
at the Fe centre, in a hitherto unreported excited singlet state that either
converts to the triplet ground state or combines with a CO or solvent molecule to
regenerate a penta-coordinated Fe species on a sub-picosecond timescale. This
finding, which resolves the debate about the relative importance of different
spin channels in the photochemistry of Fe(CO)5 (refs 4, 16 - 20), was made
possible by the ability of femtosecond X-ray spectroscopy to probe
frontier-orbital interactions with atom specificity. We expect the method to be
broadly applicable in the chemical sciences, and to complement approaches that
probe structural dynamics in ultrafast processes.

Two-particle interference is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, and is
even less intuitive than wave-particle duality for a single particle. In this
duality, classical concepts--wave or particle--are still referred to, and
interference happens in ordinary space-time. On the other hand, two-particle
interference takes place in a mathematical space that has no classical
counterpart. Entanglement lies at the heart of this interference, as it does in
the fundamental tests of quantum mechanics involving the violation of Bell's
inequalities. The Hong, Ou and Mandel experiment is a conceptually simpler
situation, in which the interference between two-photon amplitudes also leads to 
behaviour impossible to describe using a simple classical model. Here we report
the realization of the Hong, Ou and Mandel experiment using atoms instead of
photons. We create a source that emits pairs of atoms, and cause one atom of each
pair to enter one of the two input channels of a beam-splitter, and the other
atom to enter the other input channel. When the atoms are spatially overlapped so
that the two inputs are indistinguishable, the atoms always emerge together in
one of the output channels. This result opens the way to testing Bell's
inequalities involving mechanical observables of massive particles, such as
momentum, using methods inspired by quantum optics, and to testing theories of
the quantum-to-classical transition. Our work also demonstrates a new way to
benchmark non-classical atom sources that may be of interest for quantum
information processing and quantum simulation.

Planetary systems are born in the disks of gas, dust and rocky fragments that
surround newly formed stars. Solid content assembles into ever-larger rocky
fragments that eventually become planetary embryos. These then continue their
growth by accreting leftover material in the disk. Concurrently, tidal effects in
the disk cause a radial drift in the embryo orbits, a process known as migration.
Fast inward migration is predicted by theory for embryos smaller than three to
five Earth masses. With only inward migration, these embryos can only rarely
become giant planets located at Earth's distance from the Sun and beyond, in
contrast with observations. Here we report that asymmetries in the temperature
rise associated with accreting infalling material produce a force (which gives
rise to an effect that we call 'heating torque') that counteracts inward
migration. This provides a channel for the formation of giant planets and also
explains the strong planet-metallicity correlation found between the incidence of
giant planets and the heavy-element abundance of the host stars.

Human activities, especially conversion and degradation of habitats, are causing 
global biodiversity declines. How local ecological assemblages are responding is 
less clear--a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and
services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented
geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to
land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats,
these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5%,
total abundance by 39.5% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3%. We estimate
that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average
within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance (10.7%) and rarefaction-based 
richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further
losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample
richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses
concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can
deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9% average increase)
that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNA molecules that inhibit the expression
of specific target genes by binding to and cleaving their messenger RNAs or
otherwise inhibiting their translation into proteins. miRNAs are transcribed as
much larger primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), the function of which is not fully 
understood. Here we show that plant pri-miRNAs contain short open reading frame
sequences that encode regulatory peptides. The pri-miR171b of Medicago truncatula
and the pri-miR165a of Arabidopsis thaliana produce peptides, which we term
miPEP171b and miPEP165a, respectively, that enhance the accumulation of their
corresponding mature miRNAs, resulting in downregulation of target genes involved
in root development. The mechanism of miRNA-encoded peptide (miPEP) action
involves increasing transcription of the pri-miRNA. Five other pri-miRNAs of A.
thaliana and M. truncatula encode active miPEPs, suggesting that miPEPs are
widespread throughout the plant kingdom. Synthetic miPEP171b and miPEP165a

Autism is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more males than 
females; consequently, under a multifactorial genetic hypothesis, females are
affected only when they cross a higher biological threshold. We hypothesize that 
deleterious variants at conserved residues are enriched in severely affected
patients arising from female-enriched multiplex families with severe disease,
enhancing the detection of key autism genes in modest numbers of cases. Here we
show the use of this strategy by identifying missense and dosage sequence
variants in the gene encoding the adhesive junction-associated δ-catenin protein 
(CTNND2) in female-enriched multiplex families and demonstrating their
loss-of-function effect by functional analyses in zebrafish embryos and cultured 
hippocampal neurons from wild-type and Ctnnd2 null mouse embryos. Finally,
through gene expression and network analyses, we highlight a critical role for
CTNND2 in neuronal development and an intimate connection to chromatin biology.
Our data contribute to the understanding of the genetic architecture of autism
and suggest that genetic analyses of phenotypic extremes, such as female-enriched
multiplex families, are of innate value in multifactorial disorders.

Although p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis serve as
critical barriers to cancer development, emerging evidence suggests that the
metabolic activities of p53 are also important. Here we show that p53 inhibits
cystine uptake and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell 
death, by repressing expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the
cystine/glutamate antiporter. Notably, p53(3KR), an acetylation-defective mutant 
that fails to induce cell-cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis, fully retains
the ability to regulate SLC7A11 expression and induce ferroptosis upon reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Analysis of mutant mice shows that these
non-canonical p53 activities contribute to embryonic development and the
lethality associated with loss of Mdm2. Moreover, SLC7A11 is highly expressed in 
human tumours, and its overexpression inhibits ROS-induced ferroptosis and
abrogates p53(3KR)-mediated tumour growth suppression in xenograft models. Our
findings uncover a new mode of tumour suppression based on p53 regulation of
cystine metabolism, ROS responses and ferroptosis.

Engineering the electromagnetic environment of a nanometre-scale light emitter by
use of a photonic cavity can significantly enhance its spontaneous emission rate,
through cavity quantum electrodynamics in the Purcell regime. This effect can
greatly reduce the lasing threshold of the emitter, providing a low-threshold
laser system with small footprint, low power consumption and ultrafast
modulation. An ultralow-threshold nanoscale laser has been successfully developed
by embedding quantum dots into a photonic crystal cavity (PCC). However, several 
challenges impede the practical application of this architecture, including the
random positions and compositional fluctuations of the dots, extreme difficulty
in current injection, and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits. Here we
report a new lasing strategy: an atomically thin crystalline semiconductor--that 
is, a tungsten diselenide monolayer--is non-destructively and deterministically
introduced as a gain medium at the surface of a pre-fabricated PCC. A
continuous-wave nanolaser operating in the visible regime is thereby achieved
with an optical pumping threshold as low as 27 nanowatts at 130 kelvin, similar
to the value achieved in quantum-dot PCC lasers. The key to the lasing action
lies in the monolayer nature of the gain medium, which confines direct-gap
excitons to within one nanometre of the PCC surface. The surface-gain geometry
gives unprecedented accessibility and hence the ability to tailor gain properties
via external controls such as electrostatic gating and current injection,
enabling electrically pumped operation. Our scheme is scalable and compatible
with integrated photonics for on-chip optical communication technologies.

Fluorescent and plasmonic labels and sensors have revolutionized molecular
biology, helping visualize cellular and biomolecular processes. Increasingly,
such probes are now being designed to respond to wavelengths in the near-infrared
region, where reduced tissue autofluorescence and photon attenuation enable
subsurface in vivo sensing. But even in the near-infrared region, optical
resolution and sensitivity decrease rapidly with increasing depth. Here we
present a sensor design that obviates the need for optical addressability by
operating in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) radio-frequency spectrum, where
signal attenuation and distortion by tissue and biological media are negligible, 
where background interferences vanish, and where sensors can be spatially located
using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment. The
radio-frequency-addressable sensor assemblies presented here comprise pairs of
magnetic disks spaced by swellable hydrogel material; they reversibly reconfigure
in rapid response to chosen stimuli, to give geometry-dependent, dynamic NMR
spectral signatures. The sensors can be made from biocompatible materials, are
themselves detectable down to low concentrations, and offer potential responsive 
NMR spectral shifts that are close to a million times greater than those of
traditional magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Inherent adaptability should allow
such shape-changing systems to measure numerous different environmental and
physiological indicators, thus providing broadly generalizable, MRI-compatible,
radio-frequency analogues to optically based probes for use in basic chemical,
biological, medical and engineering research.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation of the intestinal
mucosal immune system of its host. Within the thousand bacterial species present 
in the intestine, the symbiont segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB) is unique in
its ability to potently stimulate the post-natal maturation of the B- and T-cell 
compartments and induce a striking increase in the small-intestinal Th17
responses. Unlike other commensals, SFB intimately attaches to absorptive
epithelial cells in the ileum and cells overlying Peyer's patches. This
colonization does not result in pathology; rather, it protects the host from
pathogens. Yet, little is known about the SFB-host interaction that underlies the
important immunostimulatory properties of SFB, because SFB have resisted in vitro
culturing for more than 50 years. Here we grow mouse SFB outside their host in an
SFB-host cell co-culturing system. Single-celled SFB isolated from monocolonized 
mice undergo filamentation, segmentation, and differentiation to release viable
infectious particles, the intracellular offspring, which can colonize mice to
induce signature immune responses. In vitro, intracellular offspring can attach
to mouse and human host cells and recruit actin. In addition, SFB can potently
stimulate the upregulation of host innate defence genes, inflammatory cytokines, 
and chemokines. In vitro culturing thereby mimics the in vivo niche, provides new
insights into SFB growth requirements and their immunostimulatory potential, and 
makes possible the investigation of the complex developmental stages of SFB and
the detailed dissection of the unique SFB-host interaction at the cellular and
molecular levels.

The regulated release of anorexigenic α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH)
and orexigenic Agouti-related protein (AgRP) from discrete hypothalamic arcuate
neurons onto common target sites in the central nervous system has a fundamental 
role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Both peptides bind with high
affinity to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R); existing data show that α-MSH is 
an agonist that couples the receptor to the Gαs signalling pathway, while AgRP
binds competitively to block α-MSH binding and blocks the constitutive activity
mediated by the ligand-mimetic amino-terminal domain of the receptor. Here we
show that, in mice, regulation of firing activity of neurons from the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) by α-MSH and AgRP can be
mediated independently of Gαs signalling by ligand-induced coupling of MC4R to
closure of inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir7.1. Furthermore, AgRP is a 
biased agonist that hyperpolarizes neurons by binding to MC4R and opening Kir7.1,
independently of its inhibition of α-MSH binding. Consequently, Kir7.1 signalling
appears to be central to melanocortin-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis
within the PVN. Coupling of MC4R to Kir7.1 may explain unusual aspects of the
control of energy homeostasis by melanocortin signalling, including the gene
dosage effect of MC4R and the sustained effects of AgRP on food intake.

The phylogeny of Silurian and Devonian (443-358 million years (Myr) ago) fishes
remains the foremost problem in the study of the origin of modern gnathostomes
(jawed vertebrates). A central question concerns the morphology of the last
common ancestor of living jawed vertebrates, with competing hypotheses advancing 
either a chondrichthyan- or osteichthyan-like model. Here we present Janusiscus
schultzei gen. et sp. nov., an Early Devonian (approximately 415 Myr ago)
gnathostome from Siberia previously interpreted as a ray-finned fish, which
provides important new information about cranial anatomy near the last common
ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans. The skull roof of Janusiscus
resembles that of early osteichthyans, with large plates bearing vermiform ridges
and partially enclosed sensory canals. High-resolution computed tomography (CT)
reveals a braincase bearing characters typically associated with either
chondrichthyans (large hypophyseal opening accommodating the internal carotid
arteries) or osteichthyans (facial nerve exiting through jugular canal,
endolymphatic ducts exiting posterior to the skull roof) but lacking a ventral
cranial fissure, the presence of which is considered a derived feature of crown
gnathostomes. A conjunction of well-developed cranial processes in Janusiscus
helps unify the comparative anatomy of early jawed vertebrate neurocrania,
clarifying primary homologies in 'placoderms', osteichthyans and chondrichthyans.
Phylogenetic analysis further supports the chondrichthyan affinities of
'acanthodians', and places Janusiscus and the enigmatic Ramirosuarezia in a
polytomy with crown gnathostomes. The close correspondence between the skull roof
of Janusiscus and that of osteichthyans suggests that an extensive dermal
skeleton was present in the last common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, but
ambiguities arise from uncertainties in the anatomy of Ramirosuarezia. The
unexpected contrast between endoskeletal structure in Janusiscus and its
superficially osteichthyan-like dermal skeleton highlights the potential
importance of other incompletely known Siluro-Devonian 'bony fishes' for
reconstructing patterns of trait evolution near the origin of modern
gnathostomes.

Dengue disease is caused by four different flavivirus serotypes, which infect
390 million people yearly with 25% symptomatic cases and for which no licensed
vaccine is available. Recent phase III vaccine trials showed partial protection, 
and in particular no protection for dengue virus serotype 2 (refs 3, 4).
Structural studies so far have characterized only epitopes recognized by
serotype-specific human antibodies. We recently isolated human antibodies
potently neutralizing all four dengue virus serotypes. Here we describe the X-ray
structures of four of these broadly neutralizing antibodies in complex with the
envelope glycoprotein E from dengue virus serotype 2, revealing that the
recognition determinants are at a serotype-invariant site at the E-dimer
interface, including the exposed main chain of the E fusion loop and the two
conserved glycan chains. This 'E-dimer-dependent epitope' is also the binding
site for the viral glycoprotein prM during virus maturation in the secretory
pathway of the infected cell, explaining its conservation across serotypes and
highlighting an Achilles' heel of the virus with respect to antibody
neutralization. These findings will be instrumental for devising novel immunogens
to protect simultaneously against all four serotypes of dengue virus.

The skin represents the primary interface between the host and the environment.
This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important
role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity. Skin microbial communities are
highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental
challenges. How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal
microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of 
these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined 
commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators
involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus
epidermidis induces IL-17A(+) CD8(+) T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance 
innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell
responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell
subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident 
cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities.
This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune
system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and
provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal
that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be
rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals,
findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific
immunity and pathologies.

Tel1(ATM)-mediated interference suppresses clustered meiotic double-strand-break 
formation.

Meiotic recombination is a critical step in gametogenesis for many organisms,
enabling the creation of genetically diverse haploid gametes. In each meiotic
cell, recombination is initiated by numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
created by Spo11, the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein, but
how these DSBs are distributed relatively uniformly across the four chromatids
that make up each chromosome pair is poorly understood. Here we employ
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate distance-dependent DSB interference in
cis (in which the occurrence of a DSB suppresses adjacent DSB formation)--a
process that is mediated by the conserved DNA damage response kinase, Tel1(ATM). 
The inhibitory function of Tel1 acts on a relatively local scale, while over
large distances DSBs have a tendency to form independently of one another even in
the presence of Tel1. Notably, over very short distances, loss of Tel1 activity
causes DSBs to cluster within discrete zones of concerted DSB activity. Our
observations support a hierarchical view of recombination initiation where
Tel1(ATM) prevents clusters of DSBs, and further suppresses DSBs within the
surrounding chromosomal region. Such collective negative regulation will help to 
ensure that recombination events are dispersed evenly and arranged optimally for 
genetic exchange and efficient chromosome segregation.

Evolution of the snake body form reveals homoplasy in amniote Hox gene function.

Hox genes regulate regionalization of the axial skeleton in vertebrates, and
changes in their expression have been proposed to be a fundamental mechanism
driving the evolution of new body forms. The origin of the snake-like body form, 
with its deregionalized pre-cloacal axial skeleton, has been explained as either 
homogenization of Hox gene expression domains, or retention of standard
vertebrate Hox domains with alteration of downstream expression that suppresses
development of distinct regions. Both models assume a highly regionalized
ancestor, but the extent of deregionalization of the primaxial domain (vertebrae,
dorsal ribs) of the skeleton in snake-like body forms has never been analysed.
Here we combine geometric morphometrics and maximum-likelihood analysis to show
that the pre-cloacal primaxial domain of elongate, limb-reduced lizards and
snakes is not deregionalized compared with limbed taxa, and that the phylogenetic
structure of primaxial morphology in reptiles does not support a loss of
regionalization in the evolution of snakes. We demonstrate that morphometric
regional boundaries correspond to mapped gene expression domains in snakes,
suggesting that their primaxial domain is patterned by a normally functional Hox 
code. Comparison of primaxial osteology in fossil and modern amniotes with Hox
gene distributions within Amniota indicates that a functional, sequentially
expressed Hox code patterned a subtle morphological gradient along the
anterior-posterior axis in stem members of amniote clades and extant lizards,
including snakes. The highly regionalized skeletons of extant archosaurs and
mammals result from independent evolution in the Hox code and do not represent
ancestral conditions for clades with snake-like body forms. The developmental
origin of snakes is best explained by decoupling of the primaxial and abaxial
domains and by increases in somite number, not by changes in the function of
primaxial Hox genes.

Increasing global precipitation has been associated with a warming climate
resulting from a strengthening of the hydrological cycle. This increase, however,
is not spatially uniform. Observations and models have found that changes in
rainfall show patterns characterized as 'wet-gets-wetter' and
'warmer-gets-wetter'. These changes in precipitation are largely located in the
tropics and hence are probably associated with convection. However, the
underlying physical processes for the observed changes are not entirely clear.
Here we show from observations that most of the regional increase in tropical
precipitation is associated with changes in the frequency of organized deep
convection. By assessing the contributions of various convective regimes to
precipitation, we find that the spatial patterns of change in the frequency of
organized deep convection are strongly correlated with observed change in
rainfall, both positive and negative (correlation of 0.69), and can explain most 
of the patterns of increase in rainfall. In contrast, changes in less organized
forms of deep convection or changes in precipitation within organized deep
convection contribute less to changes in precipitation. Our results identify
organized deep convection as the link between changes in rainfall and in the
dynamics of the tropical atmosphere, thus providing a framework for obtaining a
better understanding of changes in rainfall. Given the lack of a distinction
between the different degrees of organization of convection in climate models,
our results highlight an area of priority for future climate model development in
order to achieve accurate rainfall projections in a warming climate.

Bulk water exists in many forms, including liquid, vapour and numerous
crystalline and amorphous phases of ice, with hexagonal ice being responsible for
the fascinating variety of snowflakes. Much less noticeable but equally
ubiquitous is water adsorbed at interfaces and confined in microscopic pores.
Such low-dimensional water determines aspects of various phenomena in materials
science, geology, biology, tribology and nanotechnology. Theory suggests many
possible phases for adsorbed and confined water, but it has proved challenging to
assess its crystal structure experimentally. Here we report high-resolution
electron microscopy imaging of water locked between two graphene sheets, an
archetypal example of hydrophobic confinement. The observations show that the
nanoconfined water at room temperature forms 'square ice'--a phase having
symmetry qualitatively different from the conventional tetrahedral geometry of
hydrogen bonding between water molecules. Square ice has a high packing density
with a lattice constant of 2.83 Å and can assemble in bilayer and trilayer
crystallites. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that square ice should be
present inside hydrophobic nanochannels independently of their exact atomic
nature.

Quantum-mechanically correlated (entangled) states of many particles are of
interest in quantum information, quantum computing and quantum metrology.
Metrologically useful entangled states of large atomic ensembles have been
experimentally realized, but these states display Gaussian spin distribution
functions with a non-negative Wigner quasiprobability distribution function.
Non-Gaussian entangled states have been produced in small ensembles of ions, and 
very recently in large atomic ensembles. Here we generate entanglement in a large
atomic ensemble via an interaction with a very weak laser pulse; remarkably, the 
detection of a single photon prepares several thousand atoms in an entangled
state. We reconstruct a negative-valued Wigner function--an important hallmark of
non-classicality--and verify an entanglement depth (the minimum number of
mutually entangled atoms) of 2,910 ± 190 out of 3,100 atoms. Attaining such a
negative Wigner function and the mutual entanglement of virtually all atoms is
unprecedented for an ensemble containing more than a few particles. Although the 
achieved purity of the state is slightly below the threshold for
entanglement-induced metrological gain, further technical improvement should
allow the generation of states that surpass this threshold, and of more complex
Schrödinger cat states for quantum metrology and information processing. More
generally, our results demonstrate the power of heralded methods for entanglement
generation, and illustrate how the information contained in a single photon can
drastically alter the quantum state of a large system.

Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei are often thought to affect the
evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, quenching
star formation and explaining the close relationship between black holes and
galaxies. Recent observations of large-scale molecular outflows in ultraluminous 
infrared galaxies support this quasar-feedback idea, because they directly trace 
the gas from which stars form. Theoretical models suggest that these outflows
originate as energy-conserving flows driven by fast accretion-disk winds.
Proposed connections between large-scale molecular outflows and accretion-disk
activity in ultraluminous galaxies were incomplete because no accretion-disk wind
had been detected. Conversely, studies of powerful accretion-disk winds have
until now focused only on X-ray observations of local Seyfert galaxies and a few 
higher-redshift quasars. Here we report observations of a powerful accretion-disk
wind with a mildly relativistic velocity (a quarter that of light) in the X-ray
spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (redshift 0.189) optically classified type
1 ultraluminous infrared galaxy hosting a powerful molecular outflow. The active 
galactic nucleus is responsible for about 80 per cent of the emission, with a
quasar-like luminosity of 1.5 × 10(46) ergs per second. The energetics of these
two types of wide-angle outflows is consistent with the energy-conserving
mechanism that is the basis of the quasar feedback in active galactic nuclei that
lack powerful radio jets (such jets are an alternative way to drive molecular
outflows).

The first step in the biogenesis of microRNAs is the processing of primary
microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by the microprocessor complex, composed of the RNA-binding
protein DGCR8 and the type III RNase DROSHA. This initial event requires
recognition of the junction between the stem and the flanking single-stranded RNA
of the pri-miRNA hairpin by DGCR8 followed by recruitment of DROSHA, which
cleaves the RNA duplex to yield the pre-miRNA product. While the mechanisms
underlying pri-miRNA processing have been determined, the mechanism by which
DGCR8 recognizes and binds pri-miRNAs, as opposed to other secondary structures
present in transcripts, is not understood. Here we find in mammalian cells that
methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) methylates pri-miRNAs, marking them for
recognition and processing by DGCR8. Consistent with this, METTL3 depletion
reduced the binding of DGCR8 to pri-miRNAs and resulted in the global reduction
of mature miRNAs and concomitant accumulation of unprocessed pri-miRNAs. In vitro
processing reactions confirmed the sufficiency of the N(6)-methyladenosine
(m(6)A) mark in promoting pri-miRNA processing. Finally, gain-of-function
experiments revealed that METTL3 is sufficient to enhance miRNA maturation in a
global and non-cell-type-specific manner. Our findings reveal that the m(6)A mark
acts as a key post-transcriptional modification that promotes the initiation of
miRNA biogenesis.

Wing polyphenism is an evolutionarily successful feature found in a wide range of
insects. Long-winged morphs can fly, which allows them to escape adverse habitats
and track changing resources, whereas short-winged morphs are flightless, but
usually possess higher fecundity than the winged morphs. Studies on aphids,
crickets and planthoppers have revealed that alternative wing morphs develop in
response to various environmental cues, and that the response to these cues may
be mediated by developmental hormones, although research in this area has yielded
equivocal and conflicting results about exactly which hormones are involved. As
it stands, the molecular mechanism underlying wing morph determination in insects
has remained elusive. Here we show that two insulin receptors in the migratory
brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, InR1 and InR2, have opposing roles in
controlling long wing versus short wing development by regulating the activity of
the forkhead transcription factor Foxo. InR1, acting via the
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-protein kinase B (Akt) signalling
cascade, leads to the long-winged morph if active and the short-winged morph if
inactive. InR2, by contrast, functions as a negative regulator of the
InR1-PI(3)K-Akt pathway: suppression of InR2 results in development of the
long-winged morph. The brain-secreted ligand Ilp3 triggers development of
long-winged morphs. Our findings provide the first evidence of a molecular basis 
for the regulation of wing polyphenism in insects, and they are also the first
demonstration--to our knowledge--of binary control over alternative developmental
outcomes, and thus deepen our understanding of the development and evolution of
phenotypic plasticity.

Cell migration is a stepwise process that coordinates multiple molecular
machineries. Using in vitro angiogenesis screens with short interfering RNA and
chemical inhibitors, we define here a MAP4K4-moesin-talin-β1-integrin molecular
pathway that promotes efficient plasma membrane retraction during endothelial
cell migration. Loss of MAP4K4 decreased membrane dynamics, slowed endothelial
cell migration, and impaired angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In migrating
endothelial cells, MAP4K4 phosphorylates moesin in retracting membranes at sites 
of focal adhesion disassembly. Epistasis analyses indicated that moesin functions
downstream of MAP4K4 to inactivate integrin by competing with talin for binding
to β1-integrin intracellular domain. Consequently, loss of moesin (encoded by the
MSN gene) or MAP4K4 reduced adhesion disassembly rate in endothelial cells.
Additionally, α5β1-integrin blockade reversed the membrane retraction defects
associated with loss of Map4k4 in vitro and in vivo. Our study uncovers a novel
aspect of endothelial cell migration. Finally, loss of MAP4K4 function suppressed
pathological angiogenesis in disease models, identifying MAP4K4 as a potential
therapeutic target.

Visualizing the physical basis for molecular behaviour inside living cells is a
great challenge for biology. RNAs are central to biological regulation, and the
ability of RNA to adopt specific structures intimately controls every step of the
gene expression program. However, our understanding of physiological RNA
structures is limited; current in vivo RNA structure profiles include only two of
the four nucleotides that make up RNA. Here we present a novel biochemical
approach, in vivo click selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment 
(icSHAPE), which enables the first global view, to our knowledge, of RNA
secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. icSHAPE of the mouse
embryonic stem cell transcriptome versus purified RNA folded in vitro shows that 
the structural dynamics of RNA in the cellular environment distinguish different 
classes of RNAs and regulatory elements. Structural signatures at translational
start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions,
suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal
structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with
RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with
atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable
accurate prediction of RNA-protein interactions and N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) 
modification genome wide. These results open the door for structural genomics of 
RNA in living cells and reveal key physiological structures controlling gene
expression.

Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a second messenger molecule that
transduces nitric-oxide- and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signalling, stimulating 
phosphorylation changes by protein kinase G. Enhancing cGMP synthesis or blocking
its degradation by phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) protects against
cardiovascular disease. However, cGMP stimulation alone is limited by
counter-adaptions including PDE upregulation. Furthermore, although PDE5A
regulates nitric-oxide-generated cGMP, nitric oxide signalling is often depressed
by heart disease. PDEs controlling natriuretic-peptide-coupled cGMP remain
uncertain. Here we show that cGMP-selective PDE9A (refs 7, 8) is expressed in the
mammalian heart, including humans, and is upregulated by hypertrophy and cardiac 
failure. PDE9A regulates natriuretic-peptide- rather than nitric-oxide-stimulated
cGMP in heart myocytes and muscle, and its genetic or selective pharmacological
inhibition protects against pathological responses to neurohormones, and
sustained pressure-overload stress. PDE9A inhibition reverses pre-established
heart disease independent of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, whereas PDE5A 
inhibition requires active NOS. Transcription factor activation and
phosphoproteome analyses of myocytes with each PDE selectively inhibited reveals 
substantial differential targeting, with phosphorylation changes from PDE5A
inhibition being more sensitive to NOS activation. Thus, unlike PDE5A, PDE9A can 
regulate cGMP signalling independent of the nitric oxide pathway, and its role in
stress-induced heart disease suggests potential as a therapeutic target.

The structure of messenger RNA is important for post-transcriptional regulation, 
mainly because it affects binding of trans-acting factors. However, little is
known about the in vivo structure of full-length mRNAs. Here we present hiCLIP, a
biochemical technique for transcriptome-wide identification of RNA secondary
structures interacting with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Using this technique to 
investigate RNA structures bound by Staufen 1 (STAU1) in human cells, we uncover 
a dominance of intra-molecular RNA duplexes, a depletion of duplexes from coding 
regions of highly translated mRNAs, an unexpected prevalence of long-range
duplexes in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), and a decreased incidence of single
nucleotide polymorphisms in duplex-forming regions. We also discover a duplex
spanning 858 nucleotides in the 3' UTR of the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA
that regulates its cytoplasmic splicing and stability. Our study reveals the
fundamental role of mRNA secondary structures in gene expression and introduces
hiCLIP as a widely applicable method for discovering new, especially long-range, 
RNA duplexes.

Controlling the wetting behaviour of liquids on surfaces is important for a
variety of industrial applications such as water-repellent coatings and
lubrication. Liquid behaviour on a surface can range from complete spreading, as 
in the 'tears of wine' effect, to minimal wetting as observed on a
superhydrophobic lotus leaf. Controlling droplet movement is important in
microfluidic liquid handling, on self-cleaning surfaces and in heat transfer.
Droplet motion can be achieved by gradients of surface energy. However, existing 
techniques require either a large gradient or a carefully prepared surface to
overcome the effects of contact line pinning, which usually limit droplet motion.
Here we show that two-component droplets of well-chosen miscible liquids such as 
propylene glycol and water deposited on clean glass are not subject to pinning
and cause the motion of neighbouring droplets over a distance. Unlike the
canonical predictions for these liquids on a high-energy surface, these droplets 
do not spread completely but exhibit an apparent contact angle. We demonstrate
experimentally and analytically that these droplets are stabilized by
evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and that they move in response to
the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. Our fundamental understanding of
this robust system enabled us to construct a wide variety of autonomous fluidic
machines out of everyday materials.

Stochastic processes in cells are associated with fluctuations in mRNA, protein
production and degradation, noisy partition of cellular components at division,
and other cell processes. Variability within a clonal population of cells
originates from such stochastic processes, which may be amplified or reduced by
deterministic factors. Cell-to-cell variability, such as that seen in the
heterogeneous response of bacteria to antibiotics, or of cancer cells to
treatment, is understood as the inevitable consequence of stochasticity.
Variability in cell-cycle duration was observed long ago; however, its sources
are still unknown. A central question is whether the variance of the observed
distribution originates from stochastic processes, or whether it arises mostly
from a deterministic process that only appears to be random. A surprising feature
of cell-cycle-duration inheritance is that it seems to be lost within one
generation but to be still present in the next generation, generating poor
correlation between mother and daughter cells but high correlation between cousin
cells. This observation suggests the existence of underlying deterministic
factors that determine the main part of cell-to-cell variability. We developed an
experimental system that precisely measures the cell-cycle duration of thousands 
of mammalian cells along several generations and a mathematical framework that
allows discrimination between stochastic and deterministic processes in lineages 
of cells. We show that the inter- and intra-generation correlations reveal
complex inheritance of the cell-cycle duration. Finally, we build a deterministic
nonlinear toy model for cell-cycle inheritance that reproduces the main features 
of our data. Our approach constitutes a general method to identify deterministic 
variability in lineages of cells or organisms, which may help to predict and,
eventually, reduce cell-to-cell heterogeneity in various systems, such as cancer 
cells under treatment.

Eukaryotic cells initiate DNA replication from multiple origins, which must be
tightly regulated to promote precise genome duplication in every cell cycle. To
accomplish this, initiation is partitioned into two temporally discrete steps: a 
double hexameric minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is first loaded at
replication origins during G1 phase, and then converted to the active CMG
(Cdc45-MCM-GINS) helicase during S phase. Here we describe the reconstitution of 
budding yeast DNA replication initiation with 16 purified replication factors,
made from 42 polypeptides. Origin-dependent initiation recapitulates regulation
seen in vivo. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibits MCM loading by
phosphorylating the origin recognition complex (ORC) and promotes CMG formation
by phosphorylating Sld2 and Sld3. Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) promotes
replication by phosphorylating MCM, and can act either before or after CDK. These
experiments define the minimum complement of proteins, protein kinase substrates 
and co-factors required for regulated eukaryotic DNA replication.

Appropriate responses to an imminent threat brace us for adversities. The ability
to sense and predict threatening or stressful events is essential for such
adaptive behaviour. In the mammalian brain, one putative stress sensor is the
paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), an area that is readily activated 
by both physical and psychological stressors. However, the role of the PVT in the
establishment of adaptive behavioural responses remains unclear. Here we show in 
mice that the PVT regulates fear processing in the lateral division of the
central amygdala (CeL), a structure that orchestrates fear learning and
expression. Selective inactivation of CeL-projecting PVT neurons prevented fear
conditioning, an effect that can be accounted for by an impairment in
fear-conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation onto somatostatin-expressing
(SOM(+)) CeL neurons, which has previously been shown to store fear memory.
Consistently, we found that PVT neurons preferentially innervate SOM(+) neurons
in the CeL, and stimulation of PVT afferents facilitated SOM(+) neuron activity
and promoted intra-CeL inhibition, two processes that are critical for fear
learning and expression. Notably, PVT modulation of SOM(+) CeL neurons was
mediated by activation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor
tropomysin-related kinase B (TrkB). As a result, selective deletion of either
Bdnf in the PVT or Trkb in SOM(+) CeL neurons impaired fear conditioning, while
infusion of BDNF into the CeL enhanced fear learning and elicited unconditioned
fear responses. Our results demonstrate that the PVT-CeL pathway constitutes a
novel circuit essential for both the establishment of fear memory and the
expression of fear responses, and uncover mechanisms linking stress detection in 
PVT with the emergence of adaptive behaviour.

Fear memories allow animals to avoid danger, thereby increasing their chances of 
survival. Fear memories can be retrieved long after learning, but little is known
about how retrieval circuits change with time. Here we show that the dorsal
midline thalamus of rats is required for the retrieval of auditory conditioned
fear at late (24 hours, 7 days, 28 days), but not early (0.5 hours, 6 hours) time
points after learning. Consistent with this, the paraventricular nucleus of the
thalamus (PVT), a subregion of the dorsal midline thalamus, showed increased
c-Fos expression only at late time points, indicating that the PVT is gradually
recruited for fear retrieval. Accordingly, the conditioned tone responses of PVT 
neurons increased with time after training. The prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex,
which is necessary for fear retrieval, sends dense projections to the PVT.
Retrieval at late time points activated PL neurons projecting to the PVT, and
optogenetic silencing of these projections impaired retrieval at late, but not
early, time points. In contrast, silencing of PL inputs to the basolateral
amygdala impaired retrieval at early, but not late, time points, indicating a
time-dependent shift in retrieval circuits. Retrieval at late time points also
activated PVT neurons projecting to the central nucleus of the amygdala, and
silencing these projections at late, but not early, time points induced a
persistent attenuation of fear. Thus, the PVT may act as a crucial thalamic node 
recruited into cortico-amygdalar networks for retrieval and maintenance of
long-term fear memories.

Cell growth and proliferation are tightly linked to nutrient availability. The
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates the presence of
growth factors, energy levels, glucose and amino acids to modulate metabolic
status and cellular responses. mTORC1 is activated at the surface of lysosomes by
the RAG GTPases and the Ragulator complex through a not fully understood
mechanism monitoring amino acid availability in the lysosomal lumen and involving
the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Here we describe the uncharacterized human member 9 of 
the solute carrier family 38 (SLC38A9) as a lysosomal membrane-resident protein
competent in amino acid transport. Extensive functional proteomic analysis
established SLC38A9 as an integral part of the Ragulator-RAG GTPases machinery.
Gain of SLC38A9 function rendered cells resistant to amino acid withdrawal,
whereas loss of SLC38A9 expression impaired amino-acid-induced mTORC1 activation.
Thus SLC38A9 is a physical and functional component of the amino acid sensing
machinery that controls the activation of mTOR.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide records indicate that the land surface has acted as a 
strong global carbon sink over recent decades, with a substantial fraction of
this sink probably located in the tropics, particularly in the Amazon.
Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as
climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the
historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three 
decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms
that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a
long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in
above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the
1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently,
while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a
shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality
increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on
mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the
Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon
uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models.

Gas clouds in present-day galaxies are inefficient at forming stars. Low
star-formation efficiency is a critical parameter in galaxy evolution: it is why 
stars are still forming nearly 14 billion years after the Big Bang and why star
clusters generally do not survive their births, instead dispersing to form
galactic disks or bulges. Yet the existence of ancient massive bound star
clusters (globular clusters) in the Milky Way suggests that efficiencies were
higher when they formed ten billion years ago. A local dwarf galaxy, NGC 5253,
has a young star cluster that provides an example of highly efficient star
formation. Here we report the detection of the J = 3→2 rotational transition of
CO at the location of the massive cluster. The gas cloud is hot, dense, quiescent
and extremely dusty. Its gas-to-dust ratio is lower than the Galactic value,
which we attribute to dust enrichment by the embedded star cluster. Its
star-formation efficiency exceeds 50 per cent, tenfold that of clouds in the
Milky Way. We suggest that high efficiency results from the force-feeding of star
formation by a streamer of gas falling into the galaxy.

Fine-scale genetic variation between human populations is interesting as a
signature of historical demographic events and because of its potential for
confounding disease studies. We use haplotype-based statistical methods to
analyse genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a carefully
chosen geographically diverse sample of 2,039 individuals from the United
Kingdom. This reveals a rich and detailed pattern of genetic differentiation with
remarkable concordance between genetic clusters and geography. The regional
genetic differentiation and differing patterns of shared ancestry with 6,209
individuals from across Europe carry clear signals of historical demographic
events. We estimate the genetic contribution to southeastern England from
Anglo-Saxon migrations to be under half, and identify the regions not carrying
genetic material from these migrations. We suggest significant pre-Roman but
post-Mesolithic movement into southeastern England from continental Europe, and
show that in non-Saxon parts of the United Kingdom, there exist genetically
differentiated subgroups rather than a general 'Celtic' population.

The process of carbon capture and sequestration has been proposed as a method of 
mitigating the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If implemented,
the cost of electricity generated by a fossil fuel-burning power plant would rise
substantially, owing to the expense of removing CO2 from the effluent stream.
There is therefore an urgent need for more efficient gas separation technologies,
such as those potentially offered by advanced solid adsorbents. Here we show that
diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks can behave as 'phase-change'
adsorbents, with unusual step-shaped CO2 adsorption isotherms that shift markedly
with temperature. Results from spectroscopic, diffraction and computational
studies show that the origin of the sharp adsorption step is an unprecedented
cooperative process in which, above a metal-dependent threshold pressure, CO2
molecules insert into metal-amine bonds, inducing a reorganization of the amines 
into well-ordered chains of ammonium carbamate. As a consequence, large CO2
separation capacities can be achieved with small temperature swings, and
regeneration energies appreciably lower than achievable with state-of-the-art
aqueous amine solutions become feasible. The results provide a mechanistic
framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO2 from various
gas mixtures, and yield insights into the conservation of Mg(2+) within the
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase family of enzymes.

After stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) mature and migrate to draining lymph
nodes to induce immune responses. As such, autologous DCs generated ex vivo have 
been pulsed with tumour antigens and injected back into patients as
immunotherapy. While DC vaccines have shown limited promise in the treatment of
patients with advanced cancers including glioblastoma, the factors dictating DC
vaccine efficacy remain poorly understood. Here we show that pre-conditioning the
vaccine site with a potent recall antigen such as tetanus/diphtheria (Td) toxoid 
can significantly improve the lymph node homing and efficacy of
tumour-antigen-specific DCs. To assess the effect of vaccine site
pre-conditioning in humans, we randomized patients with glioblastoma to
pre-conditioning with either mature DCs or Td unilaterally before bilateral
vaccination with DCs pulsed with Cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) RNA. We
and other laboratories have shown that pp65 is expressed in more than 90% of
glioblastoma specimens but not in surrounding normal brain, providing an
unparalleled opportunity to subvert this viral protein as a tumour-specific
target. Patients given Td had enhanced DC migration bilaterally and significantly
improved survival. In mice, Td pre-conditioning also enhanced bilateral DC
migration and suppressed tumour growth in a manner dependent on the chemokine
CCL3. Our clinical studies and corroborating investigations in mice suggest that 
pre-conditioning with a potent recall antigen may represent a viable strategy to 
improve anti-tumour immunotherapy.

Initiation of cellular DNA replication is tightly controlled to sustain genomic
integrity. In eukaryotes, the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) is
essential for coordinating replication onset. Here we describe the crystal
structure of Drosophila ORC at 3.5 Å resolution, showing that the 270 kilodalton 
initiator core complex comprises a two-layered notched ring in which a collar of 
winged-helix domains from the Orc1-5 subunits sits atop a layer of AAA+ (ATPases 
associated with a variety of cellular activities) folds. Although canonical
inter-AAA+ domain interactions exist between four of the six ORC subunits,
unanticipated features are also evident. These include highly interdigitated
domain-swapping interactions between the winged-helix folds and AAA+ modules of
neighbouring protomers, and a quasi-spiral arrangement of DNA binding elements
that circumnavigate an approximately 20 Å wide channel in the centre of the
complex. Comparative analyses indicate that ORC encircles DNA, using its
winged-helix domain face to engage the mini-chromosome maintenance 2-7 (MCM2-7)
complex during replicative helicase loading; however, an observed out-of-plane
rotation of more than 90° for the Orc1 AAA+ domain disrupts interactions with
catalytic amino acids in Orc4, narrowing and sealing off entry into the central
channel. Prima facie, our data indicate that Drosophila ORC can switch between
active and autoinhibited conformations, suggesting a novel means for cell cycle
and/or developmental control of ORC functions.

Rare tautomeric and anionic nucleobases are believed to have fundamental
biological roles, but their prevalence and functional importance has remained
elusive because they exist transiently, in low abundance, and involve subtle
movements of protons that are difficult to visualize. Using NMR relaxation
dispersion, we show here that wobble dG•dT and rG•rU mispairs in DNA and RNA
duplexes exist in dynamic equilibrium with short-lived, low-populated
Watson-Crick-like mispairs that are stabilized by rare enolic or anionic bases.
These mispairs can evade Watson-Crick fidelity checkpoints and form with
probabilities (10(-3) to 10(-5)) that strongly imply a universal role in
replication and translation errors. Our results indicate that rare tautomeric and
anionic bases are widespread in nucleic acids, expanding their structural and
functional complexity beyond that attainable with canonical bases.

Achieving site selectivity in C-H functionalization reactions is a significant
challenge, especially when the target C-H bond is distant from existing
functional groups. Coordination of a functional group to a metal is often a key
driving force and control element in many important reactions including
asymmetric hydrogenation, epoxidation and lithiation. Exploitation of this effect
has led to the development of a broad range of directed C-H activation reactions.
However, these C-H activation methods are limited to proximal C-H bonds, which
are spatially and geometrically accessible from the directing functional group.
The development of meta-selective C-H functionalizations remains a significant
challenge. We recently developed a U-shaped template that can be used to overcome
this constraint and have shown that it can be used to selectively activate remote
meta-C-H bonds. Although this approach has proved to be applicable to various
substrates and catalytic transformations, the need for a covalently attached,
complex template is a substantial drawback for synthetic applications. Here we
report an alternative approach employing norbornene as a transient mediator to
achieve meta-selective C-H activation with a simple and common ortho-directing
group. The use of a newly developed pyridine-based ligand is crucial for relaying
the palladium catalyst to the meta position by norbornene after initial ortho-C-H
activation. This catalytic reaction demonstrates the feasibility of switching
ortho-selectivity to meta-selectivity in C-H activation of the same substrate by 
catalyst control.

In Drosophila, rapid temperature changes are detected at the periphery by
dedicated receptors forming a simple sensory map for hot and cold in the brain.
However, flies show a host of complex innate and learned responses to
temperature, indicating that they are able to extract a range of information from
this simple input. Here we define the anatomical and physiological repertoire for
temperature representation in the Drosophila brain. First, we use a
photolabelling strategy to trace the connections that relay peripheral
thermosensory information to higher brain centres, and show that they largely
converge onto three target regions: the mushroom body, the lateral horn (both of 
which are well known centres for sensory processing) and the posterior lateral
protocerebrum, a region we now define as a major site of thermosensory
representation. Next, using in vivo calcium imaging, we describe the
thermosensory projection neurons selectively activated by hot or cold stimuli.
Fast-adapting neurons display transient ON and OFF responses and track rapid
temperature shifts remarkably well, while slow-adapting cell responses better
reflect the magnitude of simple thermal changes. Unexpectedly, we also find a
population of broadly tuned cells that respond to both heating and cooling, and
show that they are required for normal behavioural avoidance of both hot and cold
in a simple two-choice temperature preference assay. Taken together, our results 
uncover a coordinated ensemble of neural responses to temperature in the
Drosophila brain, demonstrate that a broadly tuned thermal line contributes to
rapid avoidance behaviour, and illustrate how stimulus quality, temporal
structure, and intensity can be extracted from a simple glomerular map at a
single synaptic station.

In Drosophila, just as in vertebrates, changes in external temperature are
encoded by bidirectional opponent thermoreceptor cells: some cells are excited by
warming and inhibited by cooling, whereas others are excited by cooling and
inhibited by warming. The central circuits that process these signals are not
understood. In Drosophila, a specific brain region receives input from
thermoreceptor cells. Here we show that distinct genetically identified
projection neurons (PNs) in this brain region are excited by cooling, warming, or
both. The PNs excited by cooling receive mainly feed-forward excitation from cool
thermoreceptors. In contrast, the PNs excited by warming ('warm-PNs') receive
both excitation from warm thermoreceptors and crossover inhibition from cool
thermoreceptors through inhibitory interneurons. Notably, this crossover
inhibition elicits warming-evoked excitation, because warming suppresses tonic
activity in cool thermoreceptors. This in turn disinhibits warm-PNs and sums with
feed-forward excitation evoked by warming. Crossover inhibition could cancel
non-thermal activity (noise) that is positively correlated among warm and cool
thermoreceptor cells, while reinforcing thermal activity which is
anti-correlated. Our results show how central circuits can combine signals from
bidirectional opponent neurons to construct sensitive and robust neural codes.

Candidates for the modest galaxies that formed most of the stars in the early
Universe, at redshifts z > 7, have been found in large numbers with extremely
deep restframe-ultraviolet imaging. But it has proved difficult for existing
spectrographs to characterize them using their ultraviolet light. The detailed
properties of these galaxies could be measured from dust and cool gas emission at
far-infrared wavelengths if the galaxies have become sufficiently enriched in
dust and metals. So far, however, the most distant galaxy discovered via its
ultraviolet emission and subsequently detected in dust emission is only at z =
3.2 (ref. 5), and recent results have cast doubt on whether dust and molecules
can be found in typical galaxies at z ≥ 7. Here we report thermal dust emission
from an archetypal early Universe star-forming galaxy, A1689-zD1. We detect its
stellar continuum in spectroscopy and determine its redshift to be z = 7.5 ± 0.2 
from a spectroscopic detection of the Lyman-α break. A1689-zD1 is representative 
of the star-forming population during the epoch of reionization, with a total
star-formation rate of about 12 solar masses per year. The galaxy is highly
evolved: it has a large stellar mass and is heavily enriched in dust, with a
dust-to-gas ratio close to that of the Milky Way. Dusty, evolved galaxies are
thus present among the fainter star-forming population at z > 7.

Polyploidy is observed across the tree of life, yet its influence on evolution
remains incompletely understood. Polyploidy, usually whole-genome duplication, is
proposed to alter the rate of evolutionary adaptation. This could occur through
complex effects on the frequency or fitness of beneficial mutations. For example,
in diverse cell types and organisms, immediately after a whole-genome
duplication, newly formed polyploids missegregate chromosomes and undergo genetic
instability. The instability following whole-genome duplications is thought to
provide adaptive mutations in microorganisms and can promote tumorigenesis in
mammalian cells. Polyploidy may also affect adaptation independently of
beneficial mutations through ploidy-specific changes in cell physiology. Here we 
perform in vitro evolution experiments to test directly whether polyploidy can
accelerate evolutionary adaptation. Compared with haploids and diploids,
tetraploids undergo significantly faster adaptation. Mathematical modelling
suggests that rapid adaptation of tetraploids is driven by higher rates of
beneficial mutations with stronger fitness effects, which is supported by
whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic analyses of evolved clones. Chromosome
aneuploidy, concerted chromosome loss, and point mutations all provide large
fitness gains. We identify several mutations whose beneficial effects are
manifest specifically in the tetraploid strains. Together, these results provide 
direct quantitative evidence that in some environments polyploidy can accelerate 
evolutionary adaptation.

The climatic impact of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is usually quantified in
terms of radiative forcing, calculated as the difference between estimates of the
Earth's radiation field from pre-industrial and present-day concentrations of
these gases. Radiative transfer models calculate that the increase in CO2 since
1750 corresponds to a global annual-mean radiative forcing at the tropopause of
1.82 ± 0.19 W m(-2) (ref. 2). However, despite widespread scientific discussion
and modelling of the climate impacts of well-mixed greenhouse gases, there is
little direct observational evidence of the radiative impact of increasing
atmospheric CO2. Here we present observationally based evidence of clear-sky CO2 
surface radiative forcing that is directly attributable to the increase, between 
2000 and 2010, of 22 parts per million atmospheric CO2. The time series of this
forcing at the two locations-the Southern Great Plains and the North Slope of
Alaska-are derived from Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer spectra
together with ancillary measurements and thoroughly corroborated radiative
transfer calculations. The time series both show statistically significant trends
of 0.2 W m(-2) per decade (with respective uncertainties of ±0.06 W m(-2) per
decade and ±0.07 W m(-2) per decade) and have seasonal ranges of 0.1-0.2 W m(-2).
This is approximately ten per cent of the trend in downwelling longwave
radiation. These results confirm theoretical predictions of the atmospheric
greenhouse effect due to anthropogenic emissions, and provide empirical evidence 
of how rising CO2 levels, mediated by temporal variations due to photosynthesis
and respiration, are affecting the surface energy balance.

Tubulin is a major component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, controlling cell
shape, structure and dynamics, whereas its bacterial homologue FtsZ establishes
the cytokinetic ring that constricts during cell division. How such different
roles of tubulin and FtsZ evolved is unknown. Studying Archaea may provide clues 
as these organisms share characteristics with Eukarya and Bacteria. Here we
report the structure and function of proteins from a distinct family related to
tubulin and FtsZ, named CetZ, which co-exists with FtsZ in many archaea. CetZ
X-ray crystal structures showed the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily fold, and one
crystal form contained sheets of protofilaments, suggesting a structural role.
However, inactivation of CetZ proteins in Haloferax volcanii did not affect cell 
division. Instead, CetZ1 was required for differentiation of the irregular
plate-shaped cells into a rod-shaped cell type that was essential for normal
swimming motility. CetZ1 formed dynamic cytoskeletal structures in vivo, relating
to its capacity to remodel the cell envelope and direct rod formation. CetZ2 was 
also implicated in H. volcanii cell shape control. Our findings expand the known 
roles of the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily to include archaeal cell shape dynamics,
suggesting that a cytoskeletal role might predate eukaryotic cell evolution, and 
they support the premise that a major function of the microbial rod shape is to
facilitate swimming.

A distinctive feature of prokaryotic gene expression is the absence of 5'-capped 
RNA. In eukaryotes, 5',5'-triphosphate-linked 7-methylguanosine protects
messenger RNA from degradation and modulates maturation, localization and
translation. Recently, the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was
reported as a covalent modification of bacterial RNA. Given the central role of
NAD in redox biochemistry, posttranslational protein modification and signalling,
its attachment to RNA indicates that there are unknown functions of RNA in these 
processes and undiscovered pathways in RNA metabolism and regulation. The unknown
identity of NAD-modified RNAs has so far precluded functional analyses. Here we
identify NAD-linked RNAs from bacteria by chemo-enzymatic capture and
next-generation sequencing (NAD captureSeq). Among those identified, specific
regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs) and sRNA-like 5'-terminal fragments of certain
mRNAs are particularly abundant. Analogous to a eukaryotic cap, 5'-NAD
modification is shown in vitro to stabilize RNA against 5'-processing by the
RNA-pyrophosphohydrolase RppH and against endonucleolytic cleavage by
ribonuclease (RNase) E. The nudix phosphohydrolase NudC decaps NAD-RNA and
thereby triggers RNase-E-mediated RNA decay, while being inactive against
triphosphate-RNA. In vivo, ∼13% of the abundant sRNA RNAI is NAD-capped in the
presence, and ∼26% in the absence, of functional NudC. To our knowledge, this is 
the first description of a cap-like structure and a decapping machinery in
bacteria.

Resveratrol is reported to extend lifespan and provide cardio-neuro-protective,
anti-diabetic, and anti-cancer effects by initiating a stress response that
induces survival genes. Because human tyrosyl transfer-RNA (tRNA) synthetase
(TyrRS) translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions, we considered the
possibility that the tyrosine-like phenolic ring of resveratrol might fit into
the active site pocket to effect a nuclear role. Here we present a 2.1 Å
co-crystal structure of resveratrol bound to the active site of TyrRS.
Resveratrol nullifies the catalytic activity and redirects TyrRS to a nuclear
function, stimulating NAD(+)-dependent auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Downstream activation of key stress
signalling pathways are causally connected to TyrRS-PARP1-NAD(+) collaboration.
This collaboration is also demonstrated in the mouse, and is specifically blocked
in vivo by a resveratrol-displacing tyrosyl adenylate analogue. In contrast to
functionally diverse tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls created by alternative
splicing events that ablate active sites, here a non-spliced TyrRS catalytic null
reveals a new PARP1- and NAD(+)-dependent dimension to the physiological
mechanism of resveratrol.

Detection of sodium-salt-rich ice grains emitted from the plume of the Saturnian 
moon Enceladus suggests that the grains formed as frozen droplets from a liquid
water reservoir that is, or has been, in contact with rock. Gravitational field
measurements suggest a regional south polar subsurface ocean of about
10 kilometres thickness located beneath an ice crust 30 to 40 kilometres thick.
These findings imply rock-water interactions in regions surrounding the core of
Enceladus. The resulting chemical 'footprints' are expected to be preserved in
the liquid and subsequently transported upwards to the near-surface plume
sources, where they eventually would be ejected and could be measured by a
spacecraft. Here we report an analysis of silicon-rich, nanometre-sized dust
particles (so-called stream particles) that stand out from the
water-ice-dominated objects characteristic of Saturn. We interpret these grains
as nanometre-sized SiO2 (silica) particles, initially embedded in icy grains
emitted from Enceladus' subsurface waters and released by sputter erosion in
Saturn's E ring. The composition and the limited size range (2 to 8 nanometres in
radius) of stream particles indicate ongoing high-temperature (>90 °C)
hydrothermal reactions associated with global-scale geothermal activity that
quickly transports hydrothermal products from the ocean floor at a depth of at
least 40 kilometres up to the plume of Enceladus.

Time is divided by geologists according to marked shifts in Earth's state. Recent
global environmental changes suggest that Earth may have entered a new
human-dominated geological epoch, the Anthropocene. Here we review the historical
genesis of the idea and assess anthropogenic signatures in the geological record 
against the formal requirements for the recognition of a new epoch. The evidence 
suggests that of the various proposed dates two do appear to conform to the
criteria to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene: 1610 and 1964. The formal
establishment of an Anthropocene Epoch would mark a fundamental change in the
relationship between humans and the Earth system.

The Universe's largest galaxies reside at the centres of galaxy clusters and are 
embedded in hot gas that, if left undisturbed, would cool quickly and create many
more new stars than are actually observed. Cooling can be regulated by feedback
from accretion of cooling gas onto the central black hole, but requires an
accretion rate finely tuned to the thermodynamic state of the hot gas.
Theoretical models in which cold clouds precipitate out of the hot gas via
thermal instability and accrete onto the black hole exhibit the necessary tuning.
Recent observational evidence shows that the abundance of cold gas in the centres
of clusters increases rapidly near the predicted threshold for instability. Here 
we report observations showing that this precipitation threshold extends over a
large range in cluster radius, cluster mass and cosmic time. We incorporate the
precipitation threshold into a framework of theoretical models for the
thermodynamic state of hot gas in galaxy clusters. According to that framework,
precipitation regulates star formation in some giant galaxies, while thermal
conduction prevents star formation in others if it can compensate for radiative
cooling and shut off precipitation.

Signalling by Wnt proteins is finely balanced to ensure normal development and
tissue homeostasis while avoiding diseases such as cancer. This is achieved in
part by Notum, a highly conserved secreted feedback antagonist. Notum has been
thought to act as a phospholipase, shedding glypicans and associated Wnt proteins
from the cell surface. However, this view fails to explain specificity, as
glypicans bind many extracellular ligands. Here we provide genetic evidence in
Drosophila that Notum requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signalling, but does not
cleave their glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. Structural analyses reveal
glycosaminoglycan binding sites on Notum, which probably help Notum to
co-localize with Wnt proteins. They also identify, at the active site of human
and Drosophila Notum, a large hydrophobic pocket that accommodates palmitoleate. 
Kinetic and mass spectrometric analyses of human proteins show that Notum is a
carboxylesterase that removes an essential palmitoleate moiety from Wnt proteins 
and thus constitutes the first known extracellular protein deacylase.

Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies ∼30% of deaths worldwide,
including those caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer. However, the
dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because
they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above
extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden
evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution
lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor
the relative frequencies of ∼500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some
expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial
mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable
consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial
small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that 
result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early
evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic
effects become important.

Boreal lakes are biogeochemical hotspots that alter carbon fluxes by sequestering
particulate organic carbon in sediments and by oxidizing terrestrial dissolved
organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane through microbial processes. At
present, such dilute lakes release ∼1.4 petagrams of carbon annually to the
atmosphere, and this carbon efflux may increase in the future in response to
elevated temperatures and increased hydrological delivery of mineralizable
dissolved organic matter to lakes. Much less is known about the potential effects
of climate changes on carbon fluxes from carbonate-rich hardwater and saline
lakes that account for about 20 per cent of inland water surface area. Here we
show that atmospheric warming may reduce CO2 emissions from hardwater lakes. We
analyse decadal records of meteorological variability, CO2 fluxes and water
chemistry to investigate the processes affecting variations in pH and carbon
exchange in hydrologically diverse lakes of central North America. We find that
the lakes have shifted progressively from being substantial CO2 sources in the
mid-1990s to sequestering CO2 by 2010, with a steady increase in annual mean pH. 
We attribute the observed changes in pH and CO2 uptake to an
atmospheric-warming-induced decline in ice cover in spring that decreases CO2
accumulation under ice, increases spring and summer pH, and enhances the chemical
uptake of CO2 in hardwater lakes. Our study suggests that rising temperatures do 
not invariably increase CO2 emissions from aquatic ecosystems.

prokaryotes. Upon infection, short phage sequences known as spacers integrate
between CRISPR repeats and are transcribed into small RNA molecules that guide
the Cas9 nuclease to the viral targets (protospacers). Streptococcus pyogenes
Cas9 cleavage of the viral genome requires the presence of a 5'-NGG-3'
protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence immediately downstream of the viral
target. It is not known whether and how viral sequences flanked by the correct
PAM are chosen as new spacers. Here we show that Cas9 selects functional spacers 
by recognizing their PAM during spacer acquisition. The replacement of cas9 with 
alleles that lack the PAM recognition motif or recognize an NGGNG PAM eliminated 
or changed PAM specificity during spacer acquisition, respectively. Cas9
associates with other proteins of the acquisition machinery (Cas1, Cas2 and
Csn2), presumably to provide PAM-specificity to this process. These results
establish a new function for Cas9 in the genesis of prokaryotic immunological
memory.

Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have great potential to contribute to a
better understanding of some of the most important issues in many-body physics,
such as high-temperature superconductivity. The Hubbard model--a simplified
representation of fermions moving on a periodic lattice--is thought to describe
the essential details of copper oxide superconductivity. This model describes
many of the features shared by the copper oxides, including an interaction-driven
Mott insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices
filled with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully
realize the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a
platform for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram. Realization of
strongly correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the
atoms to temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the
lack of reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering
of light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realization of the
three-dimensional Hubbard model at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM
phase transition. This temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a
simple high-temperature series expansion, which brings our experiment close to
the limit of the capabilities of current numerical techniques, particularly at
metallic densities. We reach these low temperatures using a compensated optical
lattice technique, in which the confinement of each lattice beam is compensated
by a blue-detuned laser beam. The temperature of the atoms in the lattice is
deduced by comparing the light scattering to determinant quantum Monte Carlo
simulations and numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further
refinement of the compensated lattice may produce even lower temperatures which, 
along with light scattering thermometry, would open avenues for producing and
characterizing other novel quantum states of matter, such as the pseudogap regime
and correlated metallic states of the two-dimensional Hubbard model.

Bacteria and archaea insert spacer sequences acquired from foreign DNAs into
CRISPR loci to generate immunological memory. The Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2
complex mediates spacer acquisition in vivo, but the molecular mechanism of this 
process is unknown. Here we show that the purified Cas1-Cas2 complex integrates
oligonucleotide DNA substrates into acceptor DNA to yield products similar to
those generated by retroviral integrases and transposases. Cas1 is the catalytic 
subunit and Cas2 substantially increases integration activity. Protospacer DNA
with free 3'-OH ends and supercoiled target DNA are required, and integration
occurs preferentially at the ends of CRISPR repeats and at sequences adjacent to 
cruciform structures abutting AT-rich regions, similar to the CRISPR leader
sequence. Our results demonstrate the Cas1-Cas2 complex to be the minimal
machinery that catalyses spacer DNA acquisition and explain the significance of
CRISPR repeats in providing sequence and structural specificity for
Cas1-Cas2-mediated adaptive immunity.

Despite three decades of successful, predominantly phenotype-driven discovery of 
the genetic causes of monogenic disorders, up to half of children with severe
developmental disorders of probable genetic origin remain without a genetic
diagnosis. Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have
eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable
clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, 
very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased
genotype-driven approach to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. 
By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and 
their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing and array-based detection 
of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with
developmental disorders. These newly implicated genes increase by 10% (from 28%
to 31%) the proportion of children that could be diagnosed. Clustering of
missense mutations in six of these newly implicated genes suggests that normal
development is being perturbed by an activating or dominant-negative mechanism.
Our findings demonstrate the value of adopting a comprehensive strategy, both
genome-wide and nationwide, to elucidate the underlying causes of rare genetic
disorders.

The orexin (also known as hypocretin) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond
to orexin neuropeptides in the central nervous system to regulate sleep and other
behavioural functions in humans. Defects in orexin signalling are responsible for
the human diseases of narcolepsy and cataplexy; inhibition of orexin receptors is
an effective therapy for insomnia. The human OX2 receptor (OX2R) belongs to the β
branch of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, and can bind to diverse compounds
including the native agonist peptides orexin-A and orexin-B and the potent
therapeutic inhibitor suvorexant. Here, using lipid-mediated crystallization and 
protein engineering with a novel fusion chimaera, we solved the structure of the 
human OX2R bound to suvorexant at 2.5 Å resolution. The structure reveals how
suvorexant adopts a π-stacked horseshoe-like conformation and binds to the
receptor deep in the orthosteric pocket, stabilizing a network of extracellular
salt bridges and blocking transmembrane helix motions necessary for activation.
Computational docking suggests how other classes of synthetic antagonists may
interact with the receptor at a similar position in an analogous π-stacked
fashion. Elucidation of the molecular architecture of the human OX2R expands our 
understanding of peptidergic GPCR ligand recognition and will aid further efforts
to modulate orexin signalling for therapeutic ends.

Collective behaviour enhances environmental sensing and decision-making in groups
of animals. Experimental and theoretical investigations of schooling fish,
flocking birds and human crowds have demonstrated that simple interactions
between individuals can explain emergent group dynamics. These findings indicate 
the existence of neural circuits that support distributed behaviours, but the
molecular and cellular identities of relevant sensory pathways are unknown. Here 
we show that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits collective responses to an aversive
odour: individual flies weakly avoid the stimulus, but groups show enhanced
escape reactions. Using high-resolution behavioural tracking, computational
simulations, genetic perturbations, neural silencing and optogenetic activation
we demonstrate that this collective odour avoidance arises from cascades of
appendage touch interactions between pairs of flies. Inter-fly touch sensing and 
collective behaviour require the activity of distal leg mechanosensory sensilla
neurons and the mechanosensory channel NOMPC. Remarkably, through these inter-fly
encounters, wild-type flies can elicit avoidance behaviour in mutant animals that
cannot sense the odour--a basic form of communication. Our data highlight the
unexpected importance of social context in the sensory responses of a solitary
species and open the door to a neural-circuit-level understanding of collective
behaviour in animal groups.

Obesity is an increasingly prevalent disease regulated by genetic and
environmental factors. Emerging studies indicate that immune cells, including
monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes, regulate metabolic homeostasis and are
dysregulated in obesity. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) can regulate
adaptive immunity and eosinophil and alternatively activated macrophage
responses, and were recently identified in murine white adipose tissue (WAT)
where they may act to limit the development of obesity. However, ILC2s have not
been identified in human adipose tissue, and the mechanisms by which ILC2s
regulate metabolic homeostasis remain unknown. Here we identify ILC2s in human
WAT and demonstrate that decreased ILC2 responses in WAT are a conserved
characteristic of obesity in humans and mice. Interleukin (IL)-33 was found to be
critical for the maintenance of ILC2s in WAT and in limiting adiposity in mice by
increasing caloric expenditure. This was associated with recruitment of
uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)(+) beige adipocytes in WAT, a process known as
beiging or browning that regulates caloric expenditure. IL-33-induced beiging was
dependent on ILC2s, and IL-33 treatment or transfer of IL-33-elicited ILC2s was
sufficient to drive beiging independently of the adaptive immune system,
eosinophils or IL-4 receptor signalling. We found that ILC2s produce
methionine-enkephalin peptides that can act directly on adipocytes to upregulate 
Ucp1 expression in vitro and that promote beiging in vivo. Collectively, these
studies indicate that, in addition to responding to infection or tissue damage,
ILC2s can regulate adipose function and metabolic homeostasis in part via
production of enkephalin peptides that elicit beiging.

More than twenty types of retinal ganglion cells conduct visual information from 
the eye to the rest of the brain. Each retinal ganglion cell type tessellates the
retina in a regular mosaic, so that every point in visual space is processed for 
visual primitives such as contrast and motion. This information flows to two
principal brain centres: the visual cortex and the superior colliculus. The
superior colliculus plays an evolutionarily conserved role in visual behaviours, 
but its functional architecture is poorly understood. Here we report on
population recordings of visual responses from neurons in the mouse superior
colliculus. Many neurons respond preferentially to lines of a certain orientation
or movement axis. We show that cells with similar orientation preferences form
large patches that span the vertical thickness of the retinorecipient layers.
This organization is strikingly different from the randomly interspersed
orientation preferences in the mouse's visual cortex; instead, it resembles the
orientation columns observed in the visual cortices of large mammals. Notably,
adjacent superior colliculus orientation columns have only limited receptive
field overlap. This is in contrast to the organization of visual cortex, where
each point in the visual field activates neurons with all preferred orientations.
Instead, the superior colliculus favours specific contour orientations within
∼30° regions of the visual field, a finding with implications for behavioural
responses mediated by this brain centre.

Mast cells are primary effectors in allergic reactions, and may have important
roles in disease by secreting histamine and various inflammatory and
immunomodulatory substances. Although they are classically activated by
immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies, a unique property of mast cells is their
antibody-independent responsiveness to a range of cationic substances,
collectively called basic secretagogues, including inflammatory peptides and
drugs associated with allergic-type reactions. The pathogenic roles of these
substances have prompted a decades-long search for their receptor(s). Here we
report that basic secretagogues activate mouse mast cells in vitro and in vivo
through a single receptor, Mrgprb2, the orthologue of the human G-protein-coupled
receptor MRGPRX2. Secretagogue-induced histamine release, inflammation and airway
contraction are abolished in Mrgprb2-null mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that 
most classes of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved peptidergic drugs 
associated with allergic-type injection-site reactions also activate Mrgprb2 and 
MRGPRX2, and that injection-site inflammation is absent in mutant mice. Finally, 
we determine that Mrgprb2 and MRGPRX2 are targets of many small-molecule drugs
associated with systemic pseudo-allergic, or anaphylactoid, reactions; we show
that drug-induced symptoms of anaphylactoid responses are significantly reduced
in knockout mice; and we identify a common chemical motif in several of these
molecules that may help predict side effects of other compounds. These
discoveries introduce a mouse model to study mast cell activation by basic
secretagogues and identify MRGPRX2 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce a 
subset of drug-induced adverse effects.

The concept of germ layers has been one of the foremost organizing principles in 
developmental biology, classification, systematics and evolution for 150 years
(refs 1 - 3). Of the three germ layers, the mesoderm is found in bilaterian
animals but is absent in species in the phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora, which has 
been taken as evidence that the mesoderm was the final germ layer to evolve. The 
origin of the ectoderm and endoderm germ layers, however, remains unclear, with
models supporting the antecedence of each as well as a simultaneous origin. Here 
we determine the temporal and spatial components of gene expression spanning
embryonic development for all Caenorhabditis elegans genes and use it to
determine the evolutionary ages of the germ layers. The gene expression program
of the mesoderm is induced after those of the ectoderm and endoderm, thus making 
it the last germ layer both to evolve and to develop. Strikingly, the C. elegans 
endoderm and ectoderm expression programs do not co-induce; rather the endoderm
activates earlier, and this is also observed in the expression of endoderm
orthologues during the embryology of the frog Xenopus tropicalis, the sea anemone
Nematostella vectensis and the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. Querying the
phylogenetic ages of specifically expressed genes reveals that the endoderm
comprises older genes. Taken together, we propose that the endoderm program dates
back to the origin of multicellularity, whereas the ectoderm originated as a
secondary germ layer freed from ancestral feeding functions.

Besides Homo erectus (sensu lato), the eastern African fossil record of early
Homo has been interpreted as representing either a single variable species, Homo 
habilis, or two species. In the latter case, however, there is no consensus over 
the respective groupings, and which of the two includes OH 7, the
1.8-million-year-old H. habilis holotype. This partial skull and hand from
Olduvai Gorge remains pivotal to evaluating the early evolution of the Homo
lineage, and by priority names one or other of the two taxa. However, the
distorted preservation of the diagnostically important OH 7 mandible has hindered
attempts to compare this specimen with other fossils. Here we present a virtual
reconstruction of the OH 7 mandible, and compare it to other early Homo fossils. 
The reconstructed mandible is remarkably primitive, with a long and narrow dental
arcade more similar to Australopithecus afarensis than to the derived parabolic
arcades of Homo sapiens or H. erectus. We find that this shape variability is not
consistent with a single species of early Homo. Importantly, the jaw morphology
of OH 7 is incompatible with fossils assigned to Homo rudolfensis and with the
A.L. 666-1 Homo maxilla. The latter is morphologically more derived than OH 7 but
500,000 years older, suggesting that the H. habilis lineage originated before 2.3
million years ago, thus marking deep-rooted species diversity in the genus Homo. 
We also reconstructed the parietal bones of OH 7 and estimated its endocranial
volume. At between 729 and 824 ml it is larger than any previously published
value, and emphasizes the near-complete overlap in brain size among species of
early Homo. Our results clarify the H. habilis hypodigm, but raise questions
about its phylogenetic relationships. Differences between species of early Homo
appear to be characterized more by gnathic diversity than by differences in brain
size, which was highly variable within all taxa.

In 2005 and 2010 the Amazon basin experienced two strong droughts, driven by
shifts in the tropical hydrological regime possibly associated with global
climate change, as predicted by some global models. Tree mortality increased
after the 2005 drought, and regional atmospheric inversion modelling showed
basin-wide decreases in CO2 uptake in 2010 compared with 2011 (ref. 5). But the
response of tropical forest carbon cycling to these droughts is not fully
understood and there has been no detailed multi-site investigation in situ. Here 
we use several years of data from a network of thirteen 1-ha forest plots spread 
throughout South America, where each component of net primary production (NPP),
autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration is measured separately, to 
develop a better mechanistic understanding of the impact of the 2010 drought on
the Amazon forest. We find that total NPP remained constant throughout the
drought. However, towards the end of the drought, autotrophic respiration,
especially in roots and stems, declined significantly compared with measurements 
in 2009 made in the absence of drought, with extended decreases in autotrophic
respiration in the three driest plots. In the year after the drought, total NPP
remained constant but the allocation of carbon shifted towards canopy NPP and
away from fine-root NPP. Both leaf-level and plot-level measurements indicate
that severe drought suppresses photosynthesis. Scaling these measurements to the 
entire Amazon basin with rainfall data, we estimate that drought suppressed
Amazon-wide photosynthesis in 2010 by 0.38 petagrams of carbon
(0.23-0.53 petagrams of carbon). Overall, we find that during this drought,
instead of reducing total NPP, trees prioritized growth by reducing autotrophic
respiration that was unrelated to growth. This suggests that trees decrease
investment in tissue maintenance and defence, in line with eco-evolutionary
theories that trees are competitively disadvantaged in the absence of growth. We 
propose that weakened maintenance and defence investment may, in turn, cause the 
increase in post-drought tree mortality observed at our plots.

The direct functionalization of unactivated sp(3) C-H bonds is still one of the
most challenging problems facing synthetic organic chemists. The appeal of such
transformations derives from their capacity to facilitate the construction of
complex organic molecules via the coupling of simple and otherwise inert building
blocks, without introducing extraneous functional groups. Despite notable recent 
efforts, the establishment of general and mild strategies for the engagement of
sp(3) C-H bonds in C-C bond forming reactions has proved difficult. Within this
context, the discovery of chemical transformations that are able to directly
functionalize allylic methyl, methylene and methine carbons in a catalytic manner
is a priority. Although protocols for direct oxidation and amination of allylic
C-H bonds (that is, C-H bonds where an adjacent carbon is involved in a C = C
bond) have become widely established, the engagement of allylic substrates in C-C
bond forming reactions has thus far required the use of pre-functionalized
coupling partners. In particular, the direct arylation of non-functionalized
allylic systems would enable access to a series of known pharmacophores
(molecular features responsible for a drug's action), though a general solution
to this long-standing challenge remains elusive. Here we report the use of both
photoredox and organic catalysis to accomplish a mild, broadly effective direct
allylic C-H arylation. This C-C bond forming reaction readily accommodates a
broad range of alkene and electron-deficient arene reactants, and has been used
in the direct arylation of benzylic C-H bonds.

Living organisms make extensive use of micro- and nanometre-sized pores as
gatekeepers for controlling the movement of fluids, vapours and solids between
complex environments. The ability of such pores to coordinate multiphase
transport, in a highly selective and subtly triggered fashion and without
clogging, has inspired interest in synthetic gated pores for applications ranging
from fluid processing to 3D printing and lab-on-chip systems. But although
specific gating and transport behaviours have been realized by precisely
tailoring pore surface chemistries and pore geometries, a single system capable
of controlling complex, selective multiphase transport has remained a distant
prospect, and fouling is nearly inevitable. Here we introduce a gating mechanism 
that uses a capillary-stabilized liquid as a reversible, reconfigurable gate that
fills and seals pores in the closed state, and creates a non-fouling,
liquid-lined pore in the open state. Theoretical modelling and experiments
demonstrate that for each transport substance, the gating threshold-the pressure 
needed to open the pores-can be rationally tuned over a wide pressure range. This
enables us to realize in one system differential response profiles for a variety 
of liquids and gases, even letting liquids flow through the pore while preventing
gas from escaping. These capabilities allow us to dynamically modulate gas-liquid
sorting in a microfluidic flow and to separate a three-phase air-water-oil
mixture, with the liquid lining ensuring sustained antifouling behaviour. Because
the liquid gating strategy enables efficient long-term operation and can be
applied to a variety of pore structures and membrane materials, and to micro- as 
well as macroscale fluid systems, we expect it to prove useful in a wide range of
applications.

Quantum computing becomes viable when a quantum state can be protected from
environment-induced error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently reliable,
errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of identifying
and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation of states by
guaranteeing that increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical
failure-a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit 
lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in quantum
computing. Here we report the protection of classical states from environmental
bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors with increasing
system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a natural step
towards the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track errors as they
occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition parity
measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in 
retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 when using five of our nine qubits
and by a factor of 8.5 when using all nine qubits after eight cycles.
Additionally, we tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. The successful suppression of
environment-induced errors will motivate further research into the many
challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting quantum
computer.

Activity in motor cortex predicts specific movements seconds before they occur,
but how this preparatory activity relates to upcoming movements is obscure. We
dissected the conversion of preparatory activity to movement within a structured 
motor cortex circuit. An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible 
homologue of premotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of
intermingled neurons predicting ipsi- or contralateral movements, yet unilateral 
inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts
contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular
imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting
within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral
population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the
brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the
transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within 
hierarchically organized cortical circuits.

The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large and diverse community of microbes
collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. While the gut microbiota provides
important benefits to its host, especially in metabolism and immune development, 
disturbance of the microbiota-host relationship is associated with numerous
chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and the group
of obesity-associated diseases collectively referred to as metabolic syndrome. A 
primary means by which the intestine is protected from its microbiota is via
multi-layered mucus structures that cover the intestinal surface, thereby
allowing the vast majority of gut bacteria to be kept at a safe distance from
epithelial cells that line the intestine. Thus, agents that disrupt
mucus-bacterial interactions might have the potential to promote diseases
associated with gut inflammation. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that
emulsifiers, detergent-like molecules that are a ubiquitous component of
processed foods and that can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia in
vitro, might be promoting the increase in inflammatory bowel disease observed
since the mid-twentieth century. Here we report that, in mice, relatively low
concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose
and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome
in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this
disorder. Emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome was associated with microbiota
encroachment, altered species composition and increased pro-inflammatory
potential. Use of germ-free mice and faecal transplants indicated that such
changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade
inflammation and metabolic syndrome. These results support the emerging concept
that perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation
can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they
suggest that the broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to an
increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic
inflammatory diseases.

Inflammation promotes regeneration of injured tissues through poorly understood
mechanisms, some of which involve interleukin (IL)-6 family members, the
expression of which is elevated in many diseases including inflammatory bowel
diseases and colorectal cancer. Here we show in mice and human cells that gp130, 
a co-receptor for IL-6 cytokines, triggers activation of YAP and Notch,
transcriptional regulators that control tissue growth and regeneration,
independently of the gp130 effector STAT3. Through YAP and Notch, intestinal
gp130 signalling stimulates epithelial cell proliferation, causes aberrant
differentiation and confers resistance to mucosal erosion. gp130 associates with 
the related tyrosine kinases Src and Yes, which are activated on receptor
engagement to phosphorylate YAP and induce its stabilization and nuclear
translocation. This signalling module is strongly activated upon mucosal injury
to promote healing and maintain barrier function.

Long-term in vivo expression of a broad and potent entry inhibitor could
circumvent the need for a conventional vaccine for HIV-1. Adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) vectors can stably express HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs).
However, even the best bNAbs neutralize 10-50% of HIV-1 isolates inefficiently
(80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) > 5 μg ml(-1)), suggesting that high
concentrations of these antibodies would be necessary to achieve general
protection. Here we show that eCD4-Ig, a fusion of CD4-Ig with a small
CCR5-mimetic sulfopeptide, binds avidly and cooperatively to the HIV-1 envelope
glycoprotein (Env) and is more potent than the best bNAbs (geometric mean
half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) < 0.05 μg ml(-1)). Because eCD4-Ig
binds only conserved regions of Env, it is also much broader than any bNAb. For
example, eCD4-Ig efficiently neutralized 100% of a diverse panel of
neutralization-resistant HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus isolates,
including a comprehensive set of isolates resistant to the CD4-binding site bNAbs
VRC01, NIH45-46 and 3BNC117. Rhesus macaques inoculated with an AAV vector stably
expressed 17-77 μg ml(-1) of fully functional rhesus eCD4-Ig for more than
40 weeks, and these macaques were protected from several infectious challenges
with SHIV-AD8. Rhesus eCD4-Ig was also markedly less immunogenic than rhesus
forms of four well-characterized bNAbs. Our data suggest that AAV-delivered
eCD4-Ig can function like an effective HIV-1 vaccine.

Hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons promote satiety. Cannabinoid
receptor 1 (CB1R) is critical for the central regulation of food intake. Here we 
test whether CB1R-controlled feeding in sated mice is paralleled by decreased
activity of POMC neurons. We show that chemical promotion of CB1R activity
increases feeding, and notably, CB1R activation also promotes neuronal activity
of POMC cells. This paradoxical increase in POMC activity was crucial for
CB1R-induced feeding, because
designer-receptors-exclusively-activated-by-designer-drugs (DREADD)-mediated
inhibition of POMC neurons diminishes, whereas DREADD-mediated activation of POMC
neurons enhances CB1R-driven feeding. The Pomc gene encodes both the anorexigenic
peptide α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and the opioid peptide β-endorphin.
CB1R activation selectively increases β-endorphin but not
α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone release in the hypothalamus, and systemic or
hypothalamic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone blocks
acute CB1R-induced feeding. These processes involve mitochondrial adaptations
that, when blocked, abolish CB1R-induced cellular responses and feeding.
Together, these results uncover a previously unsuspected role of POMC neurons in 
the promotion of feeding by cannabinoids.

The planetary nebula stage is the ultimate fate of stars with masses one to eight
times that of the Sun (M(⊙)). The origin of their complex morphologies is poorly 
understood, although several mechanisms involving binary interaction have been
proposed. In close binary systems, the orbital separation is short enough for the
primary star to overfill its Roche lobe as the star expands during the asymptotic
giant branch phase. The excess gas eventually forms a common envelope surrounding
both stars. Drag forces then result in the envelope being ejected into a bipolar 
planetary nebula whose equator is coincident with the orbital plane of the
system. Systems in which both stars have ejected their envelopes and are evolving
towards the white dwarf stage are said to be double degenerate. Here we report
that Henize 2-428 has a double-degenerate core with a combined mass of ∼1.76M(⊙),
which is above the Chandrasekhar limit (the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf)
of 1.4M(⊙). This, together with its short orbital period (4.2 hours), suggests
that the system should merge in 700 million years, triggering a type Ia supernova
event. This supports the hypothesis of the double-degenerate, super-Chandrasekhar
evolutionary pathway for the formation of type Ia supernovae.

The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a driver oncogene in chronic myeloid leukaemia and
30-50% of cases of adult acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Introduction of ABL1
kinase inhibitors (for example, imatinib) has markedly improved patient survival,
but acquired drug resistance remains a challenge. Point mutations in the ABL1
kinase domain weaken inhibitor binding and represent the most common clinical
resistance mechanism. The BCR-ABL1 kinase domain gatekeeper mutation Thr315Ile
(T315I) confers resistance to all approved ABL1 inhibitors except ponatinib,
which has toxicity limitations. Here we combine comprehensive drug sensitivity
and resistance profiling of patient cells ex vivo with structural analysis to
establish the VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib as a selective and
effective inhibitor for T315I-mutant BCR-ABL1-driven leukaemia. Axitinib potently
inhibited BCR-ABL1(T315I), at both biochemical and cellular levels, by binding to
the active form of ABL1(T315I) in a mutation-selective binding mode. These
findings suggest that the T315I mutation shifts the conformational equilibrium of
the kinase in favour of an active (DFG-in) A-loop conformation, which has more
optimal binding interactions with axitinib. Treatment of a T315I chronic myeloid 
leukaemia patient with axitinib resulted in a rapid reduction of T315I-positive
cells from bone marrow. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unexpected
opportunity to repurpose axitinib, an anti-angiogenic drug approved for renal
cancer, as an inhibitor for ABL1 gatekeeper mutant drug-resistant leukaemia
patients. This study shows that wild-type proteins do not always sample the
conformations available to disease-relevant mutant proteins and that
comprehensive drug testing of patient-derived cells can identify unpredictable,
clinically significant drug-repositioning opportunities.

The central dogma of gene expression (DNA to RNA to protein) is universal, but in
different domains of life there are fundamental mechanistic differences within
this pathway. For example, the canonical molecular signals used to initiate
protein synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes are mutually exclusive. However, the
core structures and conformational dynamics of ribosomes that are responsible for
the translation steps that take place after initiation are ancient and conserved 
across the domains of life. We wanted to explore whether an undiscovered
RNA-based signal might be able to use these conserved features, bypassing
mechanisms specific to each domain of life, and initiate protein synthesis in
both bacteria and eukaryotes. Although structured internal ribosome entry site
(IRES) RNAs can manipulate ribosomes to initiate translation in eukaryotic cells,
an analogous RNA structure-based mechanism has not been observed in bacteria.
Here we report our discovery that a eukaryotic viral IRES can initiate
translation in live bacteria. We solved the crystal structure of this IRES bound 
to a bacterial ribosome to 3.8 Å resolution, revealing that despite differences
between bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes this IRES binds directly to both and
occupies the space normally used by transfer RNAs. Initiation in both bacteria
and eukaryotes depends on the structure of the IRES RNA, but in bacteria this RNA
uses a different mechanism that includes a form of ribosome repositioning after
initial recruitment. This IRES RNA bridges billions of years of evolutionary
divergence and provides an example of an RNA structure-based translation
initiation signal capable of operating in two domains of life.

Intrinsically disordered proteins play important roles in cell signalling,
transcription, translation and cell cycle regulation. Although they lack stable
tertiary structure, many intrinsically disordered proteins undergo
disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to partners. Similarly, several folded
proteins use regulated order-to-disorder transitions to mediate biological
function. In principle, the function of intrinsically disordered proteins may be 
controlled by post-translational modifications that lead to structural changes
such as folding, although this has not been observed. Here we show that multisite
phosphorylation induces folding of the intrinsically disordered 4E-BP2, the major
neural isoform of the family of three mammalian proteins that bind eIF4E and
suppress cap-dependent translation initiation. In its non-phosphorylated state,
4E-BP2 interacts tightly with eIF4E using both a canonical YXXXXLΦ motif
(starting at Y54) that undergoes a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding and 
a dynamic secondary binding site. We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and 
T46 induces folding of residues P18-R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded β-domain
that sequesters the helical YXXXXLΦ motif into a partly buried β-strand, blocking
its accessibility to eIF4E. The folded state of pT37pT46 4E-BP2 is weakly stable,
decreasing affinity by 100-fold and leading to an order-to-disorder transition
upon binding to eIF4E, whereas fully phosphorylated 4E-BP2 is more stable,
decreasing affinity by a factor of approximately 4,000. These results highlight
stabilization of a phosphorylation-induced fold as the essential mechanism for
phospho-regulation of the 4E-BP:eIF4E interaction and exemplify a new mode of
biological regulation mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins.

Interventions that delay ageing mobilize mechanisms that protect and repair
cellular components, but it is unknown how these interventions might slow the
functional decline of extracellular matrices, which are also damaged during
ageing. Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling (rIIS) extends lifespan across the
evolutionary spectrum, and in juvenile Caenorhabditis elegans also allows the
transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO to induce development into dauer, a diapause
that withstands harsh conditions. It has been suggested that rIIS delays C.
elegans ageing through activation of dauer-related processes during adulthood,
but some rIIS conditions confer robust lifespan extension unaccompanied by any
dauer-like traits. Here we show that rIIS can promote C. elegans longevity
through a program that is genetically distinct from the dauer pathway, and
requires the Nrf (NF-E2-related factor) orthologue SKN-1 acting in parallel to
DAF-16. SKN-1 is inhibited by IIS and has been broadly implicated in longevity,
but is rendered dispensable for rIIS lifespan extension by even mild activity of 
dauer-related processes. When IIS is decreased under conditions that do not
induce dauer traits, SKN-1 most prominently increases expression of collagens and
other extracellular matrix genes. Diverse genetic, nutritional, and
pharmacological pro-longevity interventions delay an age-related decline in
collagen expression. These collagens mediate adulthood extracellular matrix
remodelling, and are needed for ageing to be delayed by interventions that do not
involve dauer traits. By genetically delineating a dauer-independent rIIS ageing 
pathway, our results show that IIS controls a broad set of protective mechanisms 
during C. elegans adulthood, and may facilitate elucidation of processes of
general importance for longevity. The importance of collagen production in
diverse anti-ageing interventions implies that extracellular matrix remodelling
is a generally essential signature of longevity assurance, and that agents
promoting extracellular matrix youthfulness may have systemic benefit.

Filamentous actin (F-actin) is the major protein of muscle thin filaments, and
actin microfilaments are the main component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.
Mutations in different actin isoforms lead to early-onset autosomal dominant
non-syndromic hearing loss, familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections,
and multiple variations of myopathies. In striated muscle fibres, the binding of 
myosin motors to actin filaments is mainly regulated by tropomyosin and troponin.
Tropomyosin also binds to F-actin in smooth muscle and in non-muscle cells and
stabilizes and regulates the filaments there in the absence of troponin. Although
crystal structures for monomeric actin (G-actin) are available, a high-resolution
structure of F-actin is still missing, hampering our understanding of how
disease-causing mutations affect the function of thin muscle filaments and
microfilaments. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of F-actin at a
resolution of 3.7 Å in complex with tropomyosin at a resolution of 6.5 Å,
determined by electron cryomicroscopy. The structure reveals that the D-loop is
ordered and acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions that stabilize the F-actin filament. We clearly identify map density
corresponding to ADP and Mg(2+) and explain the possible effect of prominent
disease-causing mutants. A comparison of F-actin with G-actin reveals the
conformational changes during filament formation and identifies the D-loop as
their key mediator. We also confirm that negatively charged tropomyosin interacts
with a positively charged groove on F-actin. Comparison of the position of
tropomyosin in F-actin-tropomyosin with its position in our previously determined
F-actin-tropomyosin-myosin structure reveals a myosin-induced transition of
tropomyosin. Our results allow us to understand the role of individual mutations 
in the genesis of actin- and tropomyosin-related diseases and will serve as a
strong foundation for the targeted development of drugs.

RNA-binding proteins control many aspects of cellular biology through binding
single-stranded RNA binding motifs (RBMs). However, RBMs can be buried within
their local RNA structures, thus inhibiting RNA-protein interactions.
N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant and dynamic internal modification
in eukaryotic messenger RNA, can be selectively recognized by the YTHDF2 protein 
to affect the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but how m(6)A achieves its
wide-ranging physiological role needs further exploration. Here we show in human 
cells that m(6)A controls the RNA-structure-dependent accessibility of RBMs to
affect RNA-protein interactions for biological regulation; we term this mechanism
'the m(6)A-switch'. We found that m(6)A alters the local structure in mRNA and
long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) to facilitate binding of heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), an abundant nuclear RNA-binding protein responsible
for pre-mRNA processing. Combining photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and anti-m(6)A
immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) approaches enabled us to identify 39,060
m(6)A-switches among HNRNPC-binding sites; and global m(6)A reduction decreased
HNRNPC binding at 2,798 high-confidence m(6)A-switches. We determined that these 
m(6)A-switch-regulated HNRNPC-binding activities affect the abundance as well as 
alternative splicing of target mRNAs, demonstrating the regulatory role of
m(6)A-switches on gene expression and RNA maturation. Our results illustrate how 
RNA-binding proteins gain regulated access to their RBMs through m(6)A-dependent 
RNA structural remodelling, and provide a new direction for investigating
RNA-modification-coded cellular biology.

The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted 
in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how
agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement
learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however,
agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient
representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use 
these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and
other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of
reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former
evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the
phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference
reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have
achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has
previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted,
or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use
recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial
agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from 
high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We
tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We
demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game
score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms
and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester
across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and
hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory
inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of
learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.

Emulsification is a powerful, well-known technique for mixing and dispersing
immiscible components within a continuous liquid phase. Consequently, emulsions
are central components of medicine, food and performance materials. Complex
emulsions, including Janus droplets (that is, droplets with faces of differing
chemistries) and multiple emulsions, are of increasing importance in
pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostics, in the fabrication of microparticles and
capsules for food, in chemical separations, in cosmetics, and in dynamic optics. 
Because complex emulsion properties and functions are related to the droplet
geometry and composition, the development of rapid, simple fabrication approaches
allowing precise control over the droplets' physical and chemical characteristics
is critical. Significant advances in the fabrication of complex emulsions have
been made using a number of procedures, ranging from large-scale, less precise
techniques that give compositional heterogeneity using high-shear mixers and
membranes, to small-volume but more precise microfluidic methods. However, such
approaches have yet to create droplet morphologies that can be controllably
altered after emulsification. Reconfigurable complex liquids potentially have
great utility as dynamically tunable materials. Here we describe an approach to
the one-step fabrication of three- and four-phase complex emulsions with highly
controllable and reconfigurable morphologies. The fabrication makes use of the
temperature-sensitive miscibility of hydrocarbon, silicone and fluorocarbon
liquids, and is applied to both the microfluidic and the scalable batch
production of complex droplets. We demonstrate that droplet geometries can be
alternated between encapsulated and Janus configurations by varying the
interfacial tensions using hydrocarbon and fluorinated surfactants including
stimuli-responsive and cleavable surfactants. This yields a generalizable
strategy for the fabrication of multiphase emulsions with controllably
reconfigurable morphologies and the potential to create a wide range of
responsive materials.

from one object to another at a distant location, assisted by previously shared
entangled states and a classical communication channel. As well as being of
fundamental interest, teleportation has been recognized as an important element
in long-distance quantum communication, distributed quantum networks and
measurement-based quantum computation. There have been numerous demonstrations of
teleportation in different physical systems such as photons, atoms, ions,
electrons and superconducting circuits. All the previous experiments were limited
to the teleportation of one degree of freedom only. However, a single quantum
particle can naturally possess various degrees of freedom--internal and
external--and with coherent coupling among them. A fundamental open challenge is 
to teleport multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously, which is necessary to
describe a quantum particle fully and, therefore, to teleport it intact. Here we 
demonstrate quantum teleportation of the composite quantum states of a single
photon encoded in both spin and orbital angular momentum. We use photon pairs
entangled in both degrees of freedom (that is, hyper-entangled) as the quantum
channel for teleportation, and develop a method to project and discriminate
hyper-entangled Bell states by exploiting probabilistic quantum non-demolition
measurement, which can be extended to more degrees of freedom. We verify the
teleportation for both spin-orbit product states and hybrid entangled states, and
achieve a teleportation fidelity ranging from 0.57 to 0.68, above the classical
limit. Our work is a step towards the teleportation of more complex quantum
systems, and demonstrates an increase in our technical control of scalable
quantum technologies.

So far, roughly 40 quasars with redshifts greater than z = 6 have been
discovered. Each quasar contains a black hole with a mass of about one billion
solar masses (10(9) M Sun symbol). The existence of such black holes when the
Universe was less than one billion years old presents substantial challenges to
theories of the formation and growth of black holes and the coevolution of black 
holes and galaxies. Here we report the discovery of an ultraluminous quasar, SDSS
J010013.02+280225.8, at redshift z = 6.30. It has an optical and near-infrared
luminosity a few times greater than those of previously known z > 6 quasars. On
the basis of the deep absorption trough on the blue side of the Lyman-α emission 
line in the spectrum, we estimate the proper size of the ionized proximity zone
associated with the quasar to be about 26 million light years, larger than found 
with other z > 6.1 quasars with lower luminosities. We estimate (on the basis of 
a near-infrared spectrum) that the black hole has a mass of ∼1.2 × 10(10) M Sun
symbol, which is consistent with the 1.3 × 10(10) M Sun symbol derived by
assuming an Eddington-limited accretion rate.

Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal of malignancies and a major
health burden. We performed whole-genome sequencing and copy number variation
(CNV) analysis of 100 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Chromosomal
rearrangements leading to gene disruption were prevalent, affecting genes known
to be important in pancreatic cancer (TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, ARID1A and ROBO2) and 
new candidate drivers of pancreatic carcinogenesis (KDM6A and PREX2). Patterns of
structural variation (variation in chromosomal structure) classified PDACs into 4
subtypes with potential clinical utility: the subtypes were termed stable,
locally rearranged, scattered and unstable. A significant proportion harboured
focal amplifications, many of which contained druggable oncogenes (ERBB2, MET,
FGFR1, CDK6, PIK3R3 and PIK3CA), but at low individual patient prevalence.
Genomic instability co-segregated with inactivation of DNA maintenance genes
(BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2) and a mutational signature of DNA damage repair
deficiency. Of 8 patients who received platinum therapy, 4 of 5 individuals with 
these measures of defective DNA maintenance responded.

V(D)J recombination in the vertebrate immune system generates a highly diverse
population of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors by combinatorial joining of
segments of coding DNA. The RAG1-RAG2 protein complex initiates this
site-specific recombination by cutting DNA at specific sites flanking the coding 
segments. Here we report the crystal structure of the mouse RAG1-RAG2 complex at 
3.2 Å resolution. The 230-kilodalton RAG1-RAG2 heterotetramer is 'Y-shaped', with
the amino-terminal domains of the two RAG1 chains forming an intertwined stalk.
Each RAG1-RAG2 heterodimer composes one arm of the 'Y', with the active site in
the middle and RAG2 at its tip. The RAG1-RAG2 structure rationalizes more than 60
mutations identified in immunodeficient patients, as well as a large body of
genetic and biochemical data. The architectural similarity between RAG1 and the
hairpin-forming transposases Hermes and Tn5 suggests the evolutionary
conservation of these DNA rearrangements.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are widely studied by HSC transplantation into
immune- and blood-cell-depleted recipients. Single HSCs can rebuild the system
after transplantation. Chromosomal marking, viral integration and barcoding of
transplanted HSCs suggest that very low numbers of HSCs perpetuate a continuous
stream of differentiating cells. However, the numbers of productive HSCs during
normal haematopoiesis, and the flux of differentiating progeny remain unknown.
Here we devise a mouse model allowing inducible genetic labelling of the most
primitive Tie2(+) HSCs in bone marrow, and quantify label progression along
haematopoietic development by limiting dilution analysis and data-driven
modelling. During maintenance of the haematopoietic system, at least 30% or
∼5,000 HSCs are productive in the adult mouse after label induction. However, the
time to approach equilibrium between labelled HSCs and their progeny is
surprisingly long, a time scale that would exceed the mouse's life. Indeed, we
find that adult haematopoiesis is largely sustained by previously designated
'short-term' stem cells downstream of HSCs that nearly fully self-renew, and
receive rare but polyclonal HSC input. By contrast, in fetal and early postnatal 
life, HSCs are rapidly used to establish the immune and blood system. In the
adult mouse, 5-fluoruracil-induced leukopenia enhances the output of HSCs and of 
downstream compartments, thus accelerating haematopoietic flux. Label tracing
also identifies a strong lineage bias in adult mice, with several-hundred-fold
larger myeloid than lymphoid output, which is only marginally accentuated with
age. Finally, we show that transplantation imposes severe constraints on HSC
engraftment, consistent with the previously observed oligoclonal HSC activity
under these conditions. Thus, we uncover fundamental differences between the
normal maintenance of the haematopoietic system, its regulation by challenge, and
its re-establishment after transplantation. HSC fate mapping and its linked
modelling provide a quantitative framework for studying in situ the regulation of
haematopoiesis in health and disease.

The Martian limb (that is, the observed 'edge' of the planet) represents a unique
window into the complex atmospheric phenomena occurring there. Clouds of ice
crystals (CO2 ice or H2O ice) have been observed numerous times by spacecraft and
ground-based telescopes, showing that clouds are typically layered and always
confined below an altitude of 100 kilometres; suspended dust has also been
detected at altitudes up to 60 kilometres during major dust storms. Highly
concentrated and localized patches of auroral emission controlled by magnetic
field anomalies in the crust have been observed at an altitude of 130 kilometres.
Here we report the occurrence in March and April 2012 of two bright, extremely
high-altitude plumes at the Martian terminator (the day-night boundary) at 200 to
250 kilometres or more above the surface, and thus well into the ionosphere and
the exosphere. They were spotted at a longitude of about 195° west, a latitude of
about -45° (at Terra Cimmeria), extended about 500 to 1,000 kilometres in both
the north-south and east-west directions, and lasted for about 10 days. The
features exhibited day-to-day variability, and were seen at the morning
terminator but not at the evening limb, which indicates rapid evolution in less
than 10 hours and a cyclic behaviour. We used photometric measurements to explore
two possible scenarios and investigate their nature. For particles reflecting
solar radiation, clouds of CO2-ice or H2O-ice particles with an effective radius 
of 0.1 micrometres are favoured over dust. Alternatively, the plume could arise
from auroral emission, of a brightness more than 1,000 times that of the Earth's 
aurora, over a region with a strong magnetic anomaly where aurorae have
previously been detected. Importantly, both explanations defy our current
understanding of Mars' upper atmosphere.

The origin of mutations is central to understanding evolution and of key
relevance to health. Variation occurs non-randomly across the genome, and
mechanisms for this remain to be defined. Here we report that the 5' ends of
Okazaki fragments have significantly increased levels of nucleotide substitution,
indicating a replicative origin for such mutations. Using a novel method,
emRiboSeq, we map the genome-wide contribution of polymerases, and show that
despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-α 
(Pol-α) is retained in vivo, comprising approximately 1.5% of the mature genome. 
We propose that DNA-binding proteins that rapidly re-associate post-replication
act as partial barriers to Pol-δ-mediated displacement of Pol-α-synthesized DNA, 
resulting in incorporation of such Pol-α tracts and increased mutation rates at
specific sites. We observe a mutational cost to chromatin and regulatory protein 
binding, resulting in mutation hotspots at regulatory elements, with signatures
of this process detectable in both yeast and humans.

Gene transcription in animals involves the assembly of RNA polymerase II at core 
promoters and its cell-type-specific activation by enhancers that can be located 
more distally. However, how ubiquitous expression of housekeeping genes is
achieved has been less clear. In particular, it is unknown whether ubiquitously
active enhancers exist and how developmental and housekeeping gene regulation is 
separated. An attractive hypothesis is that different core promoters might
exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers. This is conceivable, as
various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between
genes of different functions, including elements that are predominantly found at 
either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes. Here we show that
thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and ovarian somatic cells
(OSCs) exhibit a marked specificity to one of two core promoters--one derived
from a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from a
developmentally regulated transcription factor--and confirm the existence of
these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse
functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while
developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer
classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring
genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition,
we identify two transcription factors--Dref and Trl--that bind and activate
housekeeping versus developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide
evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer-core-promoter specificity that separates
developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of
enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome.

A defining feature of vertebrates (craniates) is a pronounced head that is
supported and protected by a robust cellular endoskeleton. In the first
vertebrates, this skeleton probably consisted of collagenous cellular cartilage, 
which forms the embryonic skeleton of all vertebrates and the adult skeleton of
modern jawless and cartilaginous fish. In the head, most cellular cartilage is
derived from a migratory cell population called the neural crest, which arises
from the edges of the central nervous system. Because collagenous cellular
cartilage and neural crest cells have not been described in invertebrates, the
appearance of cellular cartilage derived from neural crest cells is considered a 
turning point in vertebrate evolution. Here we show that a tissue with many of
the defining features of vertebrate cellular cartilage transiently forms in the
larvae of the invertebrate chordate Branchiostoma floridae (Florida amphioxus).
We also present evidence that during evolution, a key regulator of vertebrate
cartilage development, SoxE, gained new cis-regulatory sequences that
subsequently directed its novel expression in neural crest cells. Together, these
results suggest that the origin of the vertebrate head skeleton did not depend on
the evolution of a new skeletal tissue, as is commonly thought, but on the spread
of this tissue throughout the head. We further propose that the evolution of
cis-regulatory elements near an ancient regulator of cartilage differentiation
was a major factor in the evolution of the vertebrate head skeleton.

Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) and therapy-related
myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) are well-recognized complications of cytotoxic
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. There are several features that distinguish
t-AML from de novo AML, including a higher incidence of TP53 mutations,
abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a reduced response 
to chemotherapy. However, it is not clear how prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy
influences leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations 
are selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by sequencing the
genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic
single-nucleotide variants and the percentage of chemotherapy-related
transversions are similar in t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous
chemotherapy does not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of 
t-AML/t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis was also present 
at low frequencies (0.003-0.7%) in mobilized blood leukocytes or bone marrow 3-6 
years before the development of t-AML/t-MDS, including two cases in which the
relevant TP53 mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover, functional
TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells of 
healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow
chimaeras containing both wild-type and Tp53(+/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor 
cells (HSPCs), the Tp53(+/-) HSPCs preferentially expanded after exposure to
chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce 
TP53 mutations. Rather, they support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying
age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand
preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the
founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic
abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients
with t-AML/t-MDS.

In human societies, cultural norms arise when behaviours are transmitted through 
social networks via high-fidelity social learning. However, a paucity of
experimental studies has meant that there is no comparable understanding of the
process by which socially transmitted behaviours might spread and persist in
animal populations. Here we show experimental evidence of the establishment of
foraging traditions in a wild bird population. We introduced alternative novel
foraging techniques into replicated wild sub-populations of great tits (Parus
major) and used automated tracking to map the diffusion, establishment and
long-term persistence of the seeded innovations. Furthermore, we used social
network analysis to examine the social factors that influenced diffusion
dynamics. From only two trained birds in each sub-population, the information
spread rapidly through social network ties, to reach an average of 75% of
individuals, with a total of 414 knowledgeable individuals performing 57,909
solutions over all replicates. The sub-populations were heavily biased towards
using the technique that was originally introduced, resulting in established
local traditions that were stable over two generations, despite a high population
turnover. Finally, we demonstrate a strong effect of social conformity, with
individuals disproportionately adopting the most frequent local variant when
first acquiring an innovation, and continuing to favour social information over
personal information. Cultural conformity is thought to be a key factor in the
evolution of complex culture in humans. In providing the first experimental
demonstration of conformity in a wild non-primate, and of cultural norms in
foraging techniques in any wild animal, our results suggest a much broader
taxonomic occurrence of such an apparently complex cultural behaviour.

Most haematopoietic cells renew from adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
however, macrophages in adult tissues can self-maintain independently of HSCs.
Progenitors with macrophage potential in vitro have been described in the yolk
sac before emergence of HSCs, and fetal macrophages can develop independently of 
Myb, a transcription factor required for HSC, and can persist in adult tissues.
Nevertheless, the origin of adult macrophages and the qualitative and
quantitative contributions of HSC and putative non-HSC-derived progenitors are
still unclear. Here we show in mice that the vast majority of adult
tissue-resident macrophages in liver (Kupffer cells), brain (microglia),
epidermis (Langerhans cells) and lung (alveolar macrophages) originate from a
Tie2(+) (also known as Tek) cellular pathway generating Csf1r(+) erythro-myeloid 
progenitors (EMPs) distinct from HSCs. EMPs develop in the yolk sac at embryonic 
day (E) 8.5, migrate and colonize the nascent fetal liver before E10.5, and give 
rise to fetal erythrocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and monocytes until at
least E16.5. Subsequently, HSC-derived cells replace erythrocytes, granulocytes
and monocytes. Kupffer cells, microglia and Langerhans cells are only marginally 
replaced in one-year-old mice, whereas alveolar macrophages may be progressively 
replaced in ageing mice. Our fate-mapping experiments identify, in the fetal
liver, a sequence of yolk sac EMP-derived and HSC-derived haematopoiesis, and
identify yolk sac EMPs as a common origin for tissue macrophages.

The timing and strength of wind-driven coastal upwelling along the eastern
margins of major ocean basins regulate the productivity of critical fisheries and
marine ecosystems by bringing deep and nutrient-rich waters to the sunlit
surface, where photosynthesis can occur. How coastal upwelling regimes might
change in a warming climate is therefore a question of vital importance. Although
enhanced land-ocean differential heating due to greenhouse warming has been
proposed to intensify coastal upwelling by strengthening alongshore winds,
analyses of observations and previous climate models have provided little
consensus on historical and projected trends in coastal upwelling. Here we show
that there are strong and consistent changes in the timing, intensity and spatial
heterogeneity of coastal upwelling in response to future warming in most Eastern 
Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs). An ensemble of climate models shows that by
the end of the twenty-first century the upwelling season will start earlier, end 
later and become more intense at high but not low latitudes. This projected
increase in upwelling intensity and duration at high latitudes will result in a
substantial reduction of the existing latitudinal variation in coastal upwelling.
These patterns are consistent across three of the four EBUSs (Canary, Benguela
and Humboldt, but not California). The lack of upwelling intensification and
greater uncertainty associated with the California EBUS may reflect regional
controls associated with the atmospheric response to climate change. Given the
strong linkages between upwelling and marine ecosystems, the projected changes in
the intensity, timing and spatial structure of coastal upwelling may influence
the geographical distribution of marine biodiversity.

The making and breaking of atomic bonds are essential processes in chemical
reactions. Although the ultrafast dynamics of bond breaking have been studied
intensively using time-resolved techniques, it is very difficult to study the
structural dynamics of bond making, mainly because of its bimolecular nature. It 
is especially difficult to initiate and follow diffusion-limited bond formation
in solution with ultrahigh time resolution. Here we use femtosecond time-resolved
X-ray solution scattering to visualize the formation of a gold trimer complex,
[Au(CN)2(-)]3 in real time without the limitation imposed by slow diffusion. This
photoexcited gold trimer, which has weakly bound gold atoms in the ground state, 
undergoes a sequence of structural changes, and our experiments probe the
dynamics of individual reaction steps, including covalent bond formation, the
bent-to-linear transition, bond contraction and tetramer formation with a time
resolution of ∼500 femtoseconds. We also determined the three-dimensional
structures of reaction intermediates with sub-ångström spatial resolution. This
work demonstrates that it is possible to track in detail and in real time the
structural changes that occur during a chemical reaction in solution using X-ray 
free-electron lasers and advanced analysis of time-resolved solution scattering
data.

The origin of lithium (Li) and its production process have long been uncertain.
Li could be produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, interactions of energetic
cosmic rays with interstellar matter, evolved low-mass stars, novae, and
supernova explosions. Chemical evolution models and observed stellar Li
abundances suggest that at least half the Li may have been produced in red
giants, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and novae. No direct evidence,
however, for the supply of Li from evolved stellar objects to the Galactic medium
has hitherto been found. Here we report the detection of highly blue-shifted
resonance lines of the singly ionized radioactive isotope of beryllium, (7)Be, in
the near-ultraviolet spectra of the classical nova V339 Del (Nova Delphini 2013) 
38 to 48 days after the explosion. (7)Be decays to form (7)Li within a short time
(half-life of 53.22 days). The (7)Be was created during the nova explosion via
the alpha-capture reaction (3)He(α,γ)(7)Be (ref. 5). This result supports the
theoretical prediction that a significant amount of (7)Li is produced in
classical nova explosions.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe age-related neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles,
synaptic and neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. Several genes have been
implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain
uncharacterized. Here we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics
across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of
AD-like neurodegeneration. We find a coordinated downregulation of synaptic
plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response
genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the
ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1. Human regions
orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune-cell-specific enhancer
signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci, while
decreasing-level enhancer orthologues show fetal-brain-specific enhancer
activity. Notably, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in
increasing-level enhancer orthologues, implicating immune processes in AD
predisposition. Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking
protein-altering variants, and implicate additional loci that do not reach
genome-wide significance. Our results reveal new insights into the mechanisms of 
neurodegeneration and establish the mouse as a useful model for functional
studies of AD regulatory regions.

Cancer is a disease potentiated by mutations in somatic cells. Cancer mutations
are not distributed uniformly along the human genome. Instead, different human
genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic
mutations, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer
genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the
cancer mutational landscape. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic
features are highly cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of
mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared
them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin
accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to
86% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors
of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most
likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find
that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer
mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines.
Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately
determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the DNA
sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the
identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.

Allelic differences between the two homologous chromosomes can affect the
propensity of inheritance in humans; however, the extent of such differences in
the human genome has yet to be fully explored. Here we delineate allelic
chromatin modifications and transcriptomes among a broad set of human tissues,
enabled by a chromosome-spanning haplotype reconstruction strategy. The resulting
large collection of haplotype-resolved epigenomic maps reveals extensive allelic 
biases in both chromatin state and transcription, which show considerable
variation across tissues and between individuals, and allow us to investigate
cis-regulatory relationships between genes and their control sequences. Analyses 
of histone modification maps also uncover intriguing characteristics of
cis-regulatory elements and tissue-restricted activities of repetitive elements. 
The rich data sets described here will enhance our understanding of the
mechanisms by which cis-regulatory elements control gene expression programs.

Pluripotent stem cells provide a powerful system to dissect the underlying
molecular dynamics that regulate cell fate changes during mammalian development. 
Here we report the integrative analysis of genome-wide binding data for 38
transcription factors with extensive epigenome and transcriptional data across
the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to the three germ layers. We
describe core regulatory dynamics and show the lineage-specific behaviour of
selected factors. In addition to the orchestrated remodelling of the chromatin
landscape, we find that the binding of several transcription factors is strongly 
associated with specific loss of DNA methylation in one germ layer, and in many
cases a reciprocal gain in the other layers. Taken together, our work shows
context-dependent rewiring of transcription factor binding, downstream signalling
effectors, and the epigenome during human embryonic stem cell differentiation.

Higher-order chromatin structure is emerging as an important regulator of gene
expression. Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the
genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and
lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin 
interactions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived
lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage
specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are
stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between
domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive
chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin
interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets,
we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased 
chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore 
provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying
long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.

The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic
variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a
similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium
generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells and
tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human
epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification 
patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish
global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated
activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and
trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic
marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and
providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our
results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding 
gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.

Darwin's finches, inhabiting the Galápagos archipelago and Cocos Island,
constitute an iconic model for studies of speciation and adaptive evolution. Here
we report the results of whole-genome re-sequencing of 120 individuals
representing all of the Darwin's finch species and two close relatives.
Phylogenetic analysis reveals important discrepancies with the phenotype-based
taxonomy. We find extensive evidence for interspecific gene flow throughout the
radiation. Hybridization has given rise to species of mixed ancestry. A
240 kilobase haplotype encompassing the ALX1 gene that encodes a transcription
factor affecting craniofacial development is strongly associated with beak shape 
diversity across Darwin's finch species as well as within the medium ground finch
(Geospiza fortis), a species that has undergone rapid evolution of beak shape in 
response to environmental changes. The ALX1 haplotype has contributed to
diversification of beak shapes among the Darwin's finches and, thereby, to an
expanded utilization of food resources.

The conserved co-activator complex Mediator enables regulated transcription
initiation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Here we reconstitute an active 15-subunit 
core Mediator (cMed) comprising all essential Mediator subunits from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cryo-electron microscopic structure of cMed bound
to a core initiation complex was determined at 9.7 Å resolution. cMed binds Pol
II around the Rpb4-Rpb7 stalk near the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). The
Mediator head module binds the Pol II dock and the TFIIB ribbon and stabilizes
the initiation complex. The Mediator middle module extends to the Pol II foot
with a 'plank' that may influence polymerase conformation. The Mediator subunit
Med14 forms a 'beam' between the head and middle modules and connects to the tail
module that is predicted to bind transcription activators located on upstream
DNA. The Mediator 'arm' and 'hook' domains contribute to a 'cradle' that may
position the CTD and TFIIH kinase to stimulate Pol II phosphorylation.

The strength of synaptic connections fundamentally determines how neurons
influence each other's firing. Excitatory connection amplitudes between pairs of 
cortical neurons vary over two orders of magnitude, comprising only very few
strong connections among many weaker ones. Although this highly skewed
distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its
functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how connection strength 
relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs
contribute to information processing in local microcircuits. Here we reveal that 
the strength of connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse
primary visual cortex (V1) obeys a simple rule--the few strong connections occur 
between neurons with most correlated responses, while only weak connections link 
neurons with uncorrelated responses. Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal
connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure.
Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives 
the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs
provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By
dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs
disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity. Therefore,
our results show that the apparently complex organization of excitatory
connection strength reflects the similarity of neuronal responses, and suggest
that rare, strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification in
cortical microcircuits.

Processes of melt generation and transport beneath back-arc spreading centres are
controlled by two endmember mechanisms: decompression melting similar to that at 
mid-ocean ridges and flux melting resembling that beneath arcs. The Lau Basin,
with an abundance of spreading ridges at different distances from the subduction 
zone, provides an opportunity to distinguish the effects of these two different
melting processes on magma production and crust formation. Here we present
constraints on the three-dimensional distribution of partial melt inferred from
seismic velocities obtained from Rayleigh wave tomography using land and
ocean-bottom seismographs. Low seismic velocities beneath the Central Lau
Spreading Centre and the northern Eastern Lau Spreading Centre extend deeper and 
westwards into the back-arc, suggesting that these spreading centres are fed by
melting along upwelling zones from the west, and helping to explain geochemical
differences with the Valu Fa Ridge to the south, which has no distinct deep
low-seismic-velocity anomalies. A region of low S-wave velocity, interpreted as
resulting from high melt content, is imaged in the mantle wedge beneath the
Central Lau Spreading Centre and the northeastern Lau Basin, even where no active
spreading centre currently exists. This low-seismic-velocity anomaly becomes
weaker with distance southward along the Eastern Lau Spreading Centre and the
Valu Fa Ridge, in contrast to the inferred increase in magmatic productivity. We 
propose that the anomaly variations result from changes in the efficiency of melt
extraction, with the decrease in melt to the south correlating with increased
fractional melting and higher water content in the magma. Water released from the
slab may greatly reduce the melt viscosity or increase grain size, or both,
thereby facilitating melt transport.

Methane monooxygenase (MMO) catalyses the O2-dependent conversion of methane to
methanol in methanotrophic bacteria, thereby preventing the atmospheric egress of
approximately one billion tons of this potent greenhouse gas annually. The key
reaction cycle intermediate of the soluble form of MMO (sMMO) is termed compound 
Q (Q). Q contains a unique dinuclear Fe(IV) cluster that reacts with methane to
break an exceptionally strong 105 kcal mol(-1) C-H bond and insert one oxygen
atom. No other biological oxidant, except that found in the particulate form of
MMO, is capable of such catalysis. The structure of Q remains controversial
despite numerous spectroscopic, computational and synthetic model studies. A
definitive structural assignment can be made from resonance Raman vibrational
spectroscopy but, despite efforts over the past two decades, no vibrational
spectrum of Q has yet been obtained. Here we report the core structures of Q and 
the following product complex, compound T, using time-resolved resonance Raman
spectroscopy (TR(3)). TR(3) permits fingerprinting of intermediates by their
unique vibrational signatures through extended signal averaging for short-lived
species. We report unambiguous evidence that Q possesses a bis-μ-oxo diamond core
structure and show that both bridging oxygens originate from O2. This observation
strongly supports a homolytic mechanism for O-O bond cleavage. We also show that 
T retains a single oxygen atom from O2 as a bridging ligand, while the other
oxygen atom is incorporated into the product. Capture of the extreme oxidizing
potential of Q is of great contemporary interest for bioremediation and the
development of synthetic approaches to methane-based alternative fuels and
chemical industry feedstocks. Insight into the formation and reactivity of Q from
the structure reported here is an important step towards harnessing this
potential.

Models derived from human pluripotent stem cells that accurately recapitulate
neural development in vitro and allow for the generation of specific neuronal
subtypes are of major interest to the stem cell and biomedical community. Notch
signalling, particularly through the Notch effector HES5, is a major pathway
critical for the onset and maintenance of neural progenitor cells in the
embryonic and adult nervous system. Here we report the transcriptional and
epigenomic analysis of six consecutive neural progenitor cell stages derived from
a HES5::eGFP reporter human embryonic stem cell line. Using this system, we aimed
to model cell-fate decisions including specification, expansion and patterning
during the ontogeny of cortical neural stem and progenitor cells. In order to
dissect regulatory mechanisms that orchestrate the stage-specific differentiation
process, we developed a computational framework to infer key regulators of each
cell-state transition based on the progressive remodelling of the epigenetic
landscape and then validated these through a pooled short hairpin RNA screen. We 
were also able to refine our previous observations on epigenetic priming at
transcription factor binding sites and suggest here that they are mediated by
combinations of core and stage-specific factors. Taken together, we demonstrate
the utility of our system and outline a general framework, not limited to the
context of the neural lineage, to dissect regulatory circuits of differentiation.

The role of cellular metabolism in regulating cell proliferation and
differentiation remains poorly understood. For example, most mammalian cells
cannot proliferate without exogenous glutamine supplementation even though
glutamine is a non-essential amino acid. Here we show that mouse embryonic stem
(ES) cells grown under conditions that maintain naive pluripotency are capable of
proliferation in the absence of exogenous glutamine. Despite this, ES cells
consume high levels of exogenous glutamine when the metabolite is available. In
comparison to more differentiated cells, naive ES cells utilize both glucose and 
glutamine catabolism to maintain a high level of intracellular α-ketoglutarate
(αKG). Consequently, naive ES cells exhibit an elevated αKG to succinate ratio
that promotes histone/DNA demethylation and maintains pluripotency. Direct
manipulation of the intracellular αKG/succinate ratio is sufficient to regulate
multiple chromatin modifications, including H3K27me3 and ten-eleven translocation
(Tet)-dependent DNA demethylation, which contribute to the regulation of
pluripotency-associated gene expression. In vitro, supplementation with
cell-permeable αKG directly supports ES-cell self-renewal while cell-permeable
succinate promotes differentiation. This work reveals that intracellular
αKG/succinate levels can contribute to the maintenance of cellular identity and
have a mechanistic role in the transcriptional and epigenetic state of stem
cells.

Human cancers, including breast cancers, comprise clones differing in mutation
content. Clones evolve dynamically in space and time following principles of
Darwinian evolution, underpinning important emergent features such as drug
resistance and metastasis. Human breast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means
of capturing and studying tumour biology, and breast tumour xenografts are
generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating tumours. However,
the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on the
genomic clonal architecture of tumours have not been systematically examined at
single-cell resolution. Here we show, using deep-genome and single-cell
sequencing methods, the clonal dynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent
serial propagation of primary and metastatic human breast cancers in
immunodeficient mice. In all 15 cases examined, clonal selection on engraftment
was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree
from extreme selective engraftment of minor (<5% of starting population) clones
to moderate, polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during 
serial passaging is a feature of tumours experiencing modest initial selection.
Through single-cell sequencing, we show that major mutation clusters estimated
from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the most abundant clonal 
genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we show 
that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the
same starting tumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be
reproducible determinants of evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that
measurement of genomically defined clonal population dynamics will be highly
informative for functional studies using patient-derived breast cancer
xenoengraftment.

Contusive spinal cord injury leads to a variety of disabilities owing to limited 
neuronal regeneration and functional plasticity. It is well established that an
upregulation of glial-derived chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) within
the glial scar and perineuronal net creates a barrier to axonal regrowth and
sprouting. Protein tyrosine phosphatase σ (PTPσ), along with its sister
phosphatase leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) and the nogo receptors 1 and 3
(NgR), have recently been identified as receptors for the inhibitory glycosylated
side chains of CSPGs. Here we find in rats that PTPσ has a critical role in
converting growth cones into a dystrophic state by tightly stabilizing them
within CSPG-rich substrates. We generated a membrane-permeable peptide mimetic of
the PTPσ wedge domain that binds to PTPσ and relieves CSPG-mediated inhibition.
Systemic delivery of this peptide over weeks restored substantial serotonergic
innervation to the spinal cord below the level of injury and facilitated
functional recovery of both locomotor and urinary systems. Our results add a new 
layer of understanding to the critical role of PTPσ in mediating the
growth-inhibited state of neurons due to CSPGs within the injured adult spinal
cord.

Angelman syndrome is a single-gene disorder characterized by intellectual
disability, developmental delay, behavioural uniqueness, speech impairment,
seizures and ataxia. It is caused by maternal deficiency of the imprinted gene
UBE3A, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase. All patients carry at least one copy of
paternal UBE3A, which is intact but silenced by a nuclear-localized long
non-coding RNA, UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS). Murine Ube3a-ATS
reduction by either transcription termination or topoisomerase I inhibition has
been shown to increase paternal Ube3a expression. Despite a clear understanding
of the disease-causing event in Angelman syndrome and the potential to harness
the intact paternal allele to correct the disease, no gene-specific treatment
exists for patients. Here we developed a potential therapeutic intervention for
Angelman syndrome by reducing Ube3a-ATS with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).
ASO treatment achieved specific reduction of Ube3a-ATS and sustained unsilencing 
of paternal Ube3a in neurons in vitro and in vivo. Partial restoration of UBE3A
protein in an Angelman syndrome mouse model ameliorated some cognitive deficits
associated with the disease. Although additional studies of phenotypic correction
are needed, we have developed a sequence-specific and clinically feasible method 
to activate expression of the paternal Ube3a allele.

Members of the dynein family, consisting of cytoplasmic and axonemal isoforms,
are motors that move towards the minus ends of microtubules. Cytoplasmic dynein-1
(dynein-1) plays roles in mitosis and cellular cargo transport, and is implicated
in viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases. Cytoplasmic dynein-2
(dynein-2) performs intraflagellar transport and is associated with human
skeletal ciliopathies. Dyneins share a conserved motor domain that couples cycles
of ATP hydrolysis with conformational changes to produce movement. Here we
present the crystal structure of the human cytoplasmic dynein-2 motor bound to
the ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue ADP.vanadate. The structure reveals 
a closure of the motor's ring of six AAA+ domains (ATPases associated with
various cellular activites: AAA1-AAA6). This induces a steric clash with the
linker, the key element for the generation of movement, driving it into a
conformation that is primed to produce force. Ring closure also changes the
interface between the stalk and buttress coiled-coil extensions of the motor
domain. This drives helix sliding in the stalk which causes the microtubule
binding domain at its tip to release from the microtubule. Our structure answers 
the key questions of how ATP hydrolysis leads to linker remodelling and
microtubule affinity regulation.

T-helper type 17 (TH17) cells that produce the cytokines interleukin-17A (IL-17A)
and IL-17F are implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. The
differentiation of TH17 cells is regulated by transcription factors such as
RORγt, but post-translational mechanisms preventing the rampant production of
pro-inflammatory IL-17A have received less attention. Here we show that the
deubiquitylating enzyme DUBA is a negative regulator of IL-17A production in T
cells. Mice with DUBA-deficient T cells developed exacerbated inflammation in the
small intestine after challenge with anti-CD3 antibodies. DUBA interacted with
the ubiquitin ligase UBR5, which suppressed DUBA abundance in naive T cells. DUBA
accumulated in activated T cells and stabilized UBR5, which then ubiquitylated
RORγt in response to TGF-β signalling. Our data identify DUBA as a cell-intrinsic
suppressor of IL-17 production.

The emergence of catalysis in early genetic polymers such as RNA is considered a 
key transition in the origin of life, pre-dating the appearance of protein
enzymes. DNA also demonstrates the capacity to fold into three-dimensional
structures and form catalysts in vitro. However, to what degree these natural
biopolymers comprise functionally privileged chemical scaffolds for folding or
the evolution of catalysis is not known. The ability of synthetic genetic
polymers (XNAs) with alternative backbone chemistries not found in nature to fold
into defined structures and bind ligands raises the possibility that these too
might be capable of forming catalysts (XNAzymes). Here we report the discovery of
such XNAzymes, elaborated in four different chemistries (arabino nucleic acids,
ANA; 2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids, FANA; hexitol nucleic acids, HNA; and
cyclohexene nucleic acids, CeNA) directly from random XNA oligomer pools,
exhibiting in trans RNA endonuclease and ligase activities. We also describe an
XNA-XNA ligase metalloenzyme in the FANA framework, establishing catalysis in an 
entirely synthetic system and enabling the synthesis of FANA oligomers and an
active RNA endonuclease FANAzyme from its constituent parts. These results extend
catalysis beyond biopolymers and establish technologies for the discovery of
catalysts in a wide range of polymer scaffolds not found in nature. Evolution of 
catalysis independent of any natural polymer has implications for the definition 
of chemical boundary conditions for the emergence of life on Earth and elsewhere 
in the Universe.

Genome-wide association studies have identified loci underlying human diseases,
but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we 
developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21
autoimmune diseases from genotyping data. We integrated these predictions with
transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and 
chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4(+) T-cell
subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and monocytes. We find that
∼90% of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60% mapping to immune-cell
enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe
enhancer-associated RNA upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur
near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and
stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20% directly alter recognizable
transcription factor binding motifs. Rather, most non-coding risk variants,
including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence
determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.

Grid cells represent an animal's location by firing in multiple fields arranged
in a striking hexagonal array. Such an impressive and constant regularity
prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and
environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid 
patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this
notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several
studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the 
strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid 
orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently
affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the
walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the 
hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments
such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our
results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries
compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid
firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as 
a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.

Atmospheric CO2 fluctuations over glacial-interglacial cycles remain a major
challenge to our understanding of the carbon cycle and the climate system.
Leading hypotheses put forward to explain glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2
variations invoke changes in deep-ocean carbon storage, probably modulated by
processes in the Southern Ocean, where much of the deep ocean is ventilated. A
central aspect of such models is that, during deglaciations, an isolated glacial 
deep-ocean carbon reservoir is reconnected with the atmosphere, driving the
atmospheric CO2 rise observed in ice-core records. However, direct documentation 
of changes in surface ocean carbon content and the associated transfer of carbon 
to the atmosphere during deglaciations has been hindered by the lack of proxy
reconstructions that unambiguously reflect the oceanic carbonate system.
Radiocarbon activity tracks changes in ocean ventilation, but not in ocean carbon
content, whereas proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling do not
constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed relative to that
which is taken up by the biological pump. Here we apply the boron isotope pH
proxy in planktic foraminifera to two sediment cores from the sub-Antarctic
Atlantic and the eastern equatorial Pacific as a more direct tracer of oceanic
CO2 outgassing. We show that surface waters at both locations, which partly
derive from deep water upwelled in the Southern Ocean, became a significant
source of carbon to the atmosphere during the last deglaciation, when the
concentration of atmospheric CO2 was increasing. This oceanic CO2 outgassing
supports the view that the ventilation of a deep-ocean carbon reservoir in the
Southern Ocean had a key role in the deglacial CO2 rise, although our results
allow for the possibility that processes operating in other regions may also have
been important for the glacial-interglacial ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon.

The initial multiplicity of stellar systems is highly uncertain. A number of
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of binary and multiple star
systems, including core fragmentation, disk fragmentation and stellar capture.
Observations show that protostellar and pre-main-sequence multiplicity is higher 
than the multiplicity found in field stars, which suggests that dynamical
interactions occur early, splitting up multiple systems and modifying the initial
stellar separations. Without direct, high-resolution observations of forming
systems, however, it is difficult to determine the true initial multiplicity and 
the dominant binary formation mechanism. Here we report observations of a
wide-separation (greater than 1,000 astronomical units) quadruple system composed
of a young protostar and three gravitationally bound dense gas condensations.
These condensations are the result of fragmentation of dense gas filaments, and
each condensation is expected to form a star on a timescale of 40,000 years. We
determine that the closest pair will form a bound binary, while the quadruple
stellar system itself is bound but unstable on timescales of 500,000 years
(comparable to the lifetime of the embedded protostellar phase). These
observations suggest that filament fragmentation on length scales of about 5,000 
astronomical units offers a viable pathway to the formation of multiple systems.

Grid cells are neurons with periodic spatial receptive fields (grids) that tile
two-dimensional space in a hexagonal pattern. To provide useful information about
location, grids must be stably anchored to an external reference frame. The
mechanisms underlying this anchoring process have remained elusive. Here we show 
in differently sized familiar square enclosures that the axes of the grids are
offset from the walls by an angle that minimizes symmetry with the borders of the
environment. This rotational offset is invariably accompanied by an elliptic
distortion of the grid pattern. Reversing the ellipticity analytically by a
shearing transformation removes the angular offset. This, together with the
near-absence of rotation in novel environments, suggests that the rotation
emerges through non-coaxial strain as a function of experience. The systematic
relationship between rotation and distortion of the grid pattern points to shear 
forces arising from anchoring to specific geometric reference points as key
elements of the mechanism for alignment of grid patterns to the external world.

Obesity is heritable and predisposes to many diseases. To understand the genetic 
basis of obesity better, here we conduct a genome-wide association study and
Metabochip meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI), a measure commonly used to
define obesity and assess adiposity, in up to 339,224 individuals. This analysis 
identifies 97 BMI-associated loci (P < 5 × 10(-8)), 56 of which are novel. Five
loci demonstrate clear evidence of several independent association signals, and
many loci have significant effects on other metabolic phenotypes. The 97 loci
account for ∼2.7% of BMI variation, and genome-wide estimates suggest that common
variation accounts for >20% of BMI variation. Pathway analyses provide strong
support for a role of the central nervous system in obesity susceptibility and
implicate new genes and pathways, including those related to synaptic function,
glutamate signalling, insulin secretion/action, energy metabolism, lipid biology 
and adipogenesis.

Body fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well-established predictor of
adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall adiposity. To increase our
understanding of the genetic basis of body fat distribution and its molecular
links to cardiometabolic traits, here we conduct genome-wide association
meta-analyses of traits related to waist and hip circumferences in up to 224,459 
individuals. We identify 49 loci (33 new) associated with waist-to-hip ratio
adjusted for body mass index (BMI), and an additional 19 loci newly associated
with related waist and hip circumference measures (P < 5 × 10(-8)). In total, 20 
of the 49 waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI loci show significant sexual
dimorphism, 19 of which display a stronger effect in women. The identified loci
were enriched for genes expressed in adipose tissue and for putative regulatory
elements in adipocytes. Pathway analyses implicated adipogenesis, angiogenesis,
transcriptional regulation and insulin resistance as processes affecting fat
distribution, providing insight into potential pathophysiological mechanisms.

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides in 1986 
triggered a huge amount of innovative scientific inquiry. In the almost three
decades since, much has been learned about the novel forms of quantum matter that
are exhibited in these strongly correlated electron systems. A qualitative
understanding of the nature of the superconducting state itself has been
achieved. However, unresolved issues include the astonishing complexity of the
phase diagram, the unprecedented prominence of various forms of collective
fluctuations, and the simplicity and insensitivity to material details of the
'normal' state at elevated temperatures.

Large-scale genomic studies have shown that half of epithelial ovarian cancers
(EOCs) have alterations in genes regulating homologous recombination (HR) repair.
Loss of HR accounts for the genomic instability of EOCs and for their cellular
hyper-dependence on alternative poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)-mediated DNA
repair mechanisms. Previous studies have implicated the DNA polymerase θ (Polθ
also known as POLQ, encoded by POLQ) in a pathway required for the repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks, referred to as the error-prone microhomology-mediated
end-joining (MMEJ) pathway. Whether Polθ interacts with canonical DNA repair
pathways to prevent genomic instability remains unknown. Here we report an
inverse correlation between HR activity and Polθ expression in EOCs. Knockdown of
Polθ in HR-proficient cells upregulates HR activity and RAD51 nucleofilament
assembly, while knockdown of Polθ in HR-deficient EOCs enhances cell death.
Consistent with these results, genetic inactivation of an HR gene (Fancd2) and
Polq in mice results in embryonic lethality. Moreover, Polθ contains RAD51
binding motifs and it blocks RAD51-mediated recombination. Our results reveal a
synthetic lethal relationship between the HR pathway and Polθ-mediated repair in 
EOCs, and identify Polθ as a novel druggable target for cancer therapy.

The alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery facilitates several
genomic rearrangements, some of which can lead to cellular transformation. This
error-prone repair pathway is triggered upon telomere de-protection to promote
the formation of deleterious chromosome end-to-end fusions. Using next-generation
sequencing technology, here we show that repair by alternative NHEJ yields
non-TTAGGG nucleotide insertions at fusion breakpoints of dysfunctional
telomeres. Investigating the enzymatic activity responsible for the random
insertions enabled us to identify polymerase theta (Polθ; encoded by Polq in
mice) as a crucial alternative NHEJ factor in mammalian cells. Polq inhibition
suppresses alternative NHEJ at dysfunctional telomeres, and hinders chromosomal
translocations at non-telomeric loci. In addition, we found that loss of Polq in 
mice results in increased rates of homology-directed repair, evident by
recombination of dysfunctional telomeres and accumulation of RAD51 at
double-stranded breaks. Lastly, we show that depletion of Polθ has a synergistic 
effect on cell survival in the absence of BRCA genes, suggesting that the
inhibition of this mutagenic polymerase represents a valid therapeutic avenue for
tumours carrying mutations in homology-directed repair genes.

Comets are composed of dust and frozen gases. The ices are mixed with the
refractory material either as an icy conglomerate, or as an aggregate of
pre-solar grains (grains that existed prior to the formation of the Solar
System), mantled by an ice layer. The presence of water-ice grains in periodic
comets is now well established. Modelling of infrared spectra obtained about ten 
kilometres from the nucleus of comet Hartley 2 suggests that larger dust
particles are being physically decoupled from fine-grained water-ice particles
that may be aggregates, which supports the icy-conglomerate model. It is known
that comets build up crusts of dust that are subsequently shed as they approach
perihelion. Micrometre-sized interplanetary dust particles collected in the
Earth's stratosphere and certain micrometeorites are assumed to be of cometary
origin. Here we report that grains collected from the Jupiter-family comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko come from a dusty crust that quenches the material
outflow activity at the comet surface. The larger grains (exceeding 50
micrometres across) are fluffy (with porosity over 50 per cent), and many
shattered when collected on the target plate, suggesting that they are
agglomerates of entities in the size range of interplanetary dust particles.
Their surfaces are generally rich in sodium, which explains the high sodium
abundance in cometary meteoroids. The particles collected to date therefore
probably represent parent material of interplanetary dust particles. This argues 
against comet dust being composed of a silicate core mantled by organic
refractory material and then by a mixture of water-dominated ices. At its
previous recurrence (orbital period 6.5 years), the comet's dust production
doubled when it was between 2.7 and 2.5 astronomical units from the Sun,
indicating that this was when the nucleus shed its mantle. Once the mantle is
shed, unprocessed material starts to supply the developing coma, radically
changing its dust component, which then also contains icy grains, as detected
during encounters with other comets closer to the Sun.

In the healthy adult brain synapses are continuously remodelled through a process
of elimination and formation known as structural plasticity. Reduction in synapse
number is a consistent early feature of neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting
deficient compensatory mechanisms. Although much is known about toxic processes
leading to synaptic dysfunction and loss in these disorders, how synaptic
regeneration is affected is unknown. In hibernating mammals, cooling induces loss
of synaptic contacts, which are reformed on rewarming, a form of structural
plasticity. We have found that similar changes occur in artificially cooled
laboratory rodents. Cooling and hibernation also induce a number of cold-shock
proteins in the brain, including the RNA binding protein, RBM3 (ref. 6). The
relationship of such proteins to structural plasticity is unknown. Here we show
that synapse regeneration is impaired in mouse models of neurodegenerative
disease, in association with the failure to induce RBM3. In both prion-infected
and 5XFAD (Alzheimer-type) mice, the capacity to regenerate synapses after
cooling declined in parallel with the loss of induction of RBM3. Enhanced
expression of RBM3 in the hippocampus prevented this deficit and restored the
capacity for synapse reassembly after cooling. RBM3 overexpression, achieved
either by boosting endogenous levels through hypothermia before the loss of the
RBM3 response or by lentiviral delivery, resulted in sustained synaptic
protection in 5XFAD mice and throughout the course of prion disease, preventing
behavioural deficits and neuronal loss and significantly prolonging survival. In 
contrast, knockdown of RBM3 exacerbated synapse loss in both models and
accelerated disease and prevented the neuroprotective effects of cooling. Thus,
deficient synapse regeneration, mediated at least in part by failure of the RBM3 
stress response, contributes to synapse loss throughout the course of
neurodegenerative disease. The data support enhancing cold-shock pathways as
potential protective therapies in neurodegenerative disorders.

Epithelium folding is a basic morphogenetic event that is essential in
transforming simple two-dimensional epithelial sheets into three-dimensional
structures in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Folding has been shown to rely 
on apical constriction. The resulting cell-shape changes depend either on
adherens junction basal shift or on a redistribution of myosin II, which could be
driven by mechanical signals. Yet the initial cellular mechanisms that trigger
and coordinate cell remodelling remain largely unknown. Here we unravel the
active role of apoptotic cells in initiating morphogenesis, thus revealing a
novel mechanism of epithelium folding. We show that, in a live developing tissue,
apoptotic cells exert a transient pulling force upon the apical surface of the
epithelium through a highly dynamic apico-basal myosin II cable. The apoptotic
cells then induce a non-autonomous increase in tissue tension together with
cortical myosin II apical stabilization in the surrounding tissue, eventually
resulting in epithelium folding. Together our results, supported by a theoretical
biophysical three-dimensional model, identify an apoptotic myosin-II-dependent
signal as the initial signal leading to cell reorganization and tissue folding.
This work further reveals that, far from being passively eliminated as generally 
assumed (for example, during digit individualization), apoptotic cells actively
influence their surroundings and trigger tissue remodelling through regulation of
tissue tension.

In a warming climate, surface meltwater production on large ice sheets is
expected to increase. If this water is delivered to the ice sheet base it may
have important consequences for ice dynamics. For example, basal water
distributed in a diffuse network can decrease basal friction and accelerate ice
flow, whereas channelized basal water can move quickly to the ice margin, where
it can alter fjord circulation and submarine melt rates. Less certain is whether 
surface meltwater can be trapped and stored in subglacial lakes beneath large ice
sheets. Here we show that a subglacial lake in Greenland drained quickly, as seen
in the collapse of the ice surface, and then refilled from surface meltwater
input. We use digital elevation models from stereo satellite imagery and airborne
measurements to resolve elevation changes during the evolution of the surface and
basal hydrologic systems at the Flade Isblink ice cap in northeast Greenland.
During the autumn of 2011, a collapse basin about 70 metres deep and about 0.4
cubic kilometres in volume formed near the southern summit of the ice cap as a
subglacial lake drained into a nearby fjord. Over the next two years, rapid
uplift of the floor of the basin (which is approximately 8.4 square kilometres in
area) occurred as surface meltwater flowed into crevasses around the basin margin
and refilled the subglacial lake. Our observations show that surface meltwater
can be trapped and stored at the bed of an ice sheet. Sensible and latent heat
released by this trapped meltwater could soften nearby colder basal ice and alter
downstream ice dynamics. Heat transport associated with meltwater trapped in
subglacial lakes should be considered when predicting how ice sheet behaviour
will change in a warming climate.

DEAD-box RNA helicases are vital for the regulation of various aspects of the RNA
life cycle, but the molecular underpinnings of their involvement, particularly in
mammalian cells, remain poorly understood. Here we show that the DEAD-box RNA
helicase DDX21 can sense the transcriptional status of both RNA polymerase (Pol) 
I and II to control multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis in human cells. We
demonstrate that DDX21 widely associates with Pol I- and Pol II-transcribed genes
and with diverse species of RNA, most prominently with non-coding RNAs involved
in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, including ribosomal RNA, small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and 7SK RNA. Although broad, these molecular
interactions, both at the chromatin and RNA level, exhibit remarkable specificity
for the regulation of ribosomal genes. In the nucleolus, DDX21 occupies the
transcribed rDNA locus, directly contacts both rRNA and snoRNAs, and promotes
rRNA transcription, processing and modification. In the nucleoplasm, DDX21 binds 
7SK RNA and, as a component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)
complex, is recruited to the promoters of Pol II-transcribed genes encoding
ribosomal proteins and snoRNAs. Promoter-bound DDX21 facilitates the release of
the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from the 7SK snRNP in a
manner that is dependent on its helicase activity, thereby promoting
transcription of its target genes. Our results uncover the multifaceted role of
DDX21 in multiple steps of ribosome biogenesis, and provide evidence implicating 
a mammalian RNA helicase in RNA modification and Pol II elongation control.

The manufacture of geometric engravings is generally interpreted as indicative of
modern cognition and behaviour. Key questions in the debate on the origin of such
behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to Homo sapiens, and whether 
it has a uniquely African origin. Here we report on a fossil freshwater shell
assemblage from the Hauptknochenschicht ('main bone layer') of Trinil (Java,
Indonesia), the type locality of Homo erectus discovered by Eugène Dubois in 1891
(refs 2 and 3). In the Dubois collection (in the Naturalis museum, Leiden, The
Netherlands) we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins, 
one unambiguous shell tool, and a shell with a geometric engraving. We dated
sediment contained in the shells with (40)Ar/(39)Ar and luminescence dating
methods, obtaining a maximum age of 0.54 ± 0.10 million years and a minimum age
of 0.43 ± 0.05 million years. This implies that the Trinil Hauptknochenschicht is
younger than previously estimated. Together, our data indicate that the engraving
was made by Homo erectus, and that it is considerably older than the oldest
geometric engravings described so far. Although it is at present not possible to 
assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell, this discovery suggests
that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of Asian Homo erectus cognition
and neuromotor control.

Broad and deep tumour genome sequencing has shed new light on tumour
heterogeneity and provided important insights into the evolution of metastases
arising from different clones. There is an additional layer of complexity, in
that tumour evolution may be influenced by selective pressure provided by
therapy, in a similar fashion to that occurring in infectious diseases. Here we
studied tumour genomic evolution in a patient (index patient) with metastatic
breast cancer bearing an activating PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha, PI(3)Kα) mutation. The patient was treated
with the PI(3)Kα inhibitor BYL719, which achieved a lasting clinical response,
but the patient eventually became resistant to this drug (emergence of lung
metastases) and died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and
material from a total of 14 metastatic sites was collected and sequenced. All
metastatic lesions, when compared to the pre-treatment tumour, had a copy loss of
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and those lesions that became refractory to
BYL719 had additional and different PTEN genetic alterations, resulting in the
loss of PTEN expression. To put these results in context, we examined six other
patients also treated with BYL719. Acquired bi-allelic loss of PTEN was found in 
one of these patients, whereas in two others PIK3CA mutations present in the
primary tumour were no longer detected at the time of progression. To
characterize our findings functionally, we examined the effects of PTEN knockdown
in several preclinical models (both in cell lines intrinsically sensitive to
BYL719 and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our index patient), which we
found resulted in resistance to BYL719, whereas simultaneous PI(3)K p110β
blockade reverted this resistance phenotype. We conclude that parallel genetic
evolution of separate metastatic sites with different PTEN genomic alterations
leads to a convergent PTEN-null phenotype resistant to PI(3)Kα inhibition.

Plate tectonics successfully describes the surface of Earth as a mosaic of moving
lithospheric plates. But it is not clear what happens at the base of the plates, 
the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The LAB has been well imaged with
converted teleseismic waves, whose 10-40-kilometre wavelength controls the
structural resolution. Here we use explosion-generated seismic waves (of about
0.5-kilometre wavelength) to form a high-resolution image for the base of an
oceanic plate that is subducting beneath North Island, New Zealand. Our
80-kilometre-wide image is based on P-wave reflections and shows an approximately
15° dipping, abrupt, seismic wave-speed transition (less than 1 kilometre thick) 
at a depth of about 100 kilometres. The boundary is parallel to the top of the
plate and seismic attributes indicate a P-wave speed decrease of at least 8 ± 3
per cent across it. A parallel reflection event approximately 10 kilometres
deeper shows that the decrease in P-wave speed is confined to a channel at the
base of the plate, which we interpret as a sheared zone of ponded partial melts
or volatiles. This is independent, high-resolution evidence for a low-viscosity
channel at the LAB that decouples plates from mantle flow beneath, and allows
plate tectonics to work.

Silylation of C-H bonds in aromatic heterocycles by an Earth-abundant metal
catalyst.

Heteroaromatic compounds containing carbon-silicon (C-Si) bonds are of great
interest in the fields of organic electronics and photonics, drug discovery,
nuclear medicine and complex molecule synthesis, because these compounds have
very useful physicochemical properties. Many of the methods now used to construct
heteroaromatic C-Si bonds involve stoichiometric reactions between heteroaryl
organometallic species and silicon electrophiles or direct,
transition-metal-catalysed intermolecular carbon-hydrogen (C-H) silylation using 
rhodium or iridium complexes in the presence of excess hydrogen acceptors. Both
approaches are useful, but their limitations include functional group
incompatibility, narrow scope of application, high cost and low availability of
the catalysts, and unproven scalability. For this reason, a new and general
catalytic approach to heteroaromatic C-Si bond construction that avoids such
limitations is highly desirable. Here we report an example of
cross-dehydrogenative heteroaromatic C-H functionalization catalysed by an
Earth-abundant alkali metal species. We found that readily available and
inexpensive potassium tert-butoxide catalyses the direct silylation of aromatic
heterocycles with hydrosilanes, furnishing heteroarylsilanes in a single step.
The silylation proceeds under mild conditions, in the absence of hydrogen
acceptors, ligands or additives, and is scalable to greater than 100 grams under 
optionally solvent-free conditions. Substrate classes that are difficult to
activate with precious metal catalysts are silylated in good yield and with
excellent regioselectivity. The derived heteroarylsilane products readily engage 
in versatile transformations enabling new synthetic strategies for heteroaromatic
elaboration, and are useful in their own right in pharmaceutical and materials
science applications.

Brittle intermetallic compound makes ultrastrong low-density steel with large
ductility.

Although steel has been the workhorse of the automotive industry since the 1920s,
the share by weight of steel and iron in an average light vehicle is now
gradually decreasing, from 68.1 per cent in 1995 to 60.1 per cent in 2011 (refs
1, 2). This has been driven by the low strength-to-weight ratio (specific
strength) of iron and steel, and the desire to improve such mechanical properties
with other materials. Recently, high-aluminium low-density steels have been
actively studied as a means of increasing the specific strength of an alloy by
reducing its density. But with increasing aluminium content a problem is
encountered: brittle intermetallic compounds can form in the resulting alloys,
leading to poor ductility. Here we show that an FeAl-type brittle but hard
intermetallic compound (B2) can be effectively used as a strengthening second
phase in high-aluminium low-density steel, while alleviating its harmful effect
on ductility by controlling its morphology and dispersion. The specific tensile
strength and ductility of the developed steel improve on those of the lightest
and strongest metallic materials known, titanium alloys. We found that alloying
of nickel catalyses the precipitation of nanometre-sized B2 particles in the
face-centred cubic matrix of high-aluminium low-density steel during heat
treatment of cold-rolled sheet steel. Our results demonstrate how intermetallic
compounds can be harnessed in the alloy design of lightweight steels for
structural applications and others.

Glutamate transporters terminate neurotransmission by clearing synaptically
released glutamate from the extracellular space, allowing repeated rounds of
signalling and preventing glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Crystallographic
studies of a glutamate transporter homologue from the archaeon Pyrococcus
horikoshii, GltPh, showed that distinct transport domains translocate substrates 
into the cytoplasm by moving across the membrane within a central trimerization
scaffold. Here we report direct observations of these 'elevator-like' transport
domain motions in the context of reconstituted proteoliposomes and physiological 
ion gradients using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(smFRET) imaging. We show that GltPh bearing two mutations introduced to impart
characteristics of the human transporter exhibits markedly increased transport
domain dynamics, which parallels an increased rate of substrate transport,
thereby establishing a direct temporal relationship between transport domain
motion and substrate uptake. Crystallographic and computational investigations
corroborated these findings by revealing that the 'humanizing' mutations favour
structurally 'unlocked' intermediate states in the transport cycle exhibiting
increased solvent occupancy at the interface between the transport domain and the
trimeric scaffold.

Theory and climate modelling suggest that the sensitivity of Earth's climate to
changes in radiative forcing could depend on the background climate. However,
palaeoclimate data have thus far been insufficient to provide a conclusive test
of this prediction. Here we present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
reconstructions based on multi-site boron-isotope records from the late Pliocene 
epoch (3.3 to 2.3 million years ago). We find that Earth's climate sensitivity to
CO2-based radiative forcing (Earth system sensitivity) was half as strong during 
the warm Pliocene as during the cold late Pleistocene epoch (0.8 to 0.01 million 
years ago). We attribute this difference to the radiative impacts of continental 
ice-volume changes (the ice-albedo feedback) during the late Pleistocene, because
equilibrium climate sensitivity is identical for the two intervals when we
account for such impacts using sea-level reconstructions. We conclude that, on a 
global scale, no unexpected climate feedbacks operated during the warm Pliocene, 
and that predictions of equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding long-term
ice-albedo feedbacks) for our Pliocene-like future (with CO2 levels up to maximum
Pliocene levels of 450 parts per million) are well described by the currently
accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.

Climate-induced coral bleaching is among the greatest current threats to coral
reefs, causing widespread loss of live coral cover. Conditions under which reefs 
bounce back from bleaching events or shift from coral to algal dominance are
unknown, making it difficult to predict and plan for differing reef responses
under climate change. Here we document and predict long-term reef responses to a 
major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide
mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. Following loss of >90% live coral cover, 12 of 
21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral states, while nine reefs
underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae. Functional diversity of associated 
reef fish communities shifted substantially following bleaching, returning
towards pre-disturbance structure on recovering reefs, while becoming
progressively altered on regime shifting reefs. We identified threshold values
for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the
bleaching event. Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and
in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was
relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Whether reefs were inside
no-take marine reserves had no bearing on ecosystem trajectory. Although
conditions governing regime shift or recovery dynamics were diverse,
pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity
and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories. These findings
foreshadow the likely divergent but predictable outcomes for reef ecosystems in
response to climate change, thus guiding improved management and adaptation.

Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are increasingly deployed at large scales
and in open environments. Genetic biocontainment strategies are needed to prevent
unintended proliferation of GMOs in natural ecosystems. Existing biocontainment
methods are insufficient because they impose evolutionary pressure on the
organism to eject the safeguard by spontaneous mutagenesis or horizontal gene
transfer, or because they can be circumvented by environmentally available
compounds. Here we computationally redesign essential enzymes in the first
organism possessing an altered genetic code (Escherichia coli strain C321.ΔA) to 
confer metabolic dependence on non-standard amino acids for survival. The
resulting GMOs cannot metabolically bypass their biocontainment mechanisms using 
known environmental compounds, and they exhibit unprecedented resistance to
evolutionary escape through mutagenesis and horizontal gene transfer. This work
provides a foundation for safer GMOs that are isolated from natural ecosystems by
a reliance on synthetic metabolites.

Low-molecular-mass thiols in organisms are well known for their redox-relevant
role in protection against various endogenous and exogenous stresses. In
eukaryotes and Gram-negative bacteria, the primary thiol is glutathione (GSH), a 
cysteinyl-containing tripeptide. In contrast, mycothiol (MSH), a cysteinyl
pseudo-disaccharide, is dominant in Gram-positive actinobacteria, including
antibiotic-producing actinomycetes and pathogenic mycobacteria. MSH is equivalent
to GSH, either as a cofactor or as a substrate, in numerous biochemical
processes, most of which have not been characterized, largely due to the dearth
of information concerning MSH-dependent proteins. Actinomycetes are able to
produce another thiol, ergothioneine (EGT), a histidine betaine derivative that
is widely assimilated by plants and animals for variable physiological
activities. The involvement of EGT in enzymatic reactions, however, lacks any
precedent. Here we report that the unprecedented coupling of two bacterial
thiols, MSH and EGT, has a constructive role in the biosynthesis of lincomycin A,
a sulfur-containing lincosamide (C8 sugar) antibiotic that has been widely used
for half a century to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections. EGT acts as a
carrier to template the molecular assembly, and MSH is the sulfur donor for
lincomycin maturation after thiol exchange. These thiols function through two
unusual S-glycosylations that program lincosamide transfer, activation and
modification, providing the first paradigm for EGT-associated biochemical
processes and for the poorly understood MSH-dependent biotransformations, a newly
described model that is potentially common in the incorporation of sulfur, an
element essential for life and ubiquitous in living systems.

Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are increasingly used in research and
industrial systems to produce high-value pharmaceuticals, fuels and chemicals.
Genetic isolation and intrinsic biocontainment would provide essential biosafety 
measures to secure these closed systems and enable safe applications of GMOs in
open systems, which include bioremediation and probiotics. Although safeguards
have been designed to control cell growth by essential gene regulation, inducible
toxin switches and engineered auxotrophies, these approaches are compromised by
cross-feeding of essential metabolites, leaked expression of essential genes, or 
genetic mutations. Here we describe the construction of a series of genomically
recoded organisms (GROs) whose growth is restricted by the expression of multiple
essential genes that depend on exogenously supplied synthetic amino acids (sAAs).
We introduced a Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tRNA:aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair
into the chromosome of a GRO derived from Escherichia coli that lacks all TAG
codons and release factor 1, endowing this organism with the orthogonal
translational components to convert TAG into a dedicated sense codon for sAAs.
Using multiplex automated genome engineering, we introduced in-frame TAG codons
into 22 essential genes, linking their expression to the incorporation of
synthetic phenylalanine-derived amino acids. Of the 60 sAA-dependent variants
isolated, a notable strain harbouring three TAG codons in conserved functional
residues of MurG, DnaA and SerS and containing targeted tRNA deletions maintained
robust growth and exhibited undetectable escape frequencies upon culturing
∼10(11) cells on solid media for 7 days or in liquid media for 20 days. This is a
significant improvement over existing biocontainment approaches. We constructed
synthetic auxotrophs dependent on sAAs that were not rescued by cross-feeding in 
environmental growth assays. These auxotrophic GROs possess alternative genetic
codes that impart genetic isolation by impeding horizontal gene transfer and now 
depend on the use of synthetic biochemical building blocks, advancing orthogonal 
barriers between engineered organisms and the environment.

Evolutionarily conserved SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor
attachment protein receptors) proteins form a complex that drives membrane fusion
in eukaryotes. The ATPase NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor), together with 
SNAPs (soluble NSF attachment protein), disassembles the SNARE complex into its
protein components, making individual SNAREs available for subsequent rounds of
fusion. Here we report structures of ATP- and ADP-bound NSF, and the
NSF/SNAP/SNARE (20S) supercomplex determined by single-particle electron
cryomicroscopy at near-atomic to sub-nanometre resolution without imposing
symmetry. Large, potentially force-generating, conformational differences exist
between ATP- and ADP-bound NSF. The 20S supercomplex exhibits broken symmetry,
transitioning from six-fold symmetry of the NSF ATPase domains to pseudo
four-fold symmetry of the SNARE complex. SNAPs interact with the SNARE complex
with an opposite structural twist, suggesting an unwinding mechanism. The
interfaces between NSF, SNAPs, and SNAREs exhibit characteristic electrostatic
patterns, suggesting how one NSF/SNAP species can act on many different SNARE
complexes.

Quasars have long been known to be variable sources at all wavelengths. Their
optical variability is stochastic and can be due to a variety of physical
mechanisms; it is also well-described statistically in terms of a damped random
walk model. The recent availability of large collections of astronomical time
series of flux measurements (light curves) offers new data sets for a systematic 
exploration of quasar variability. Here we report the detection of a strong,
smooth periodic signal in the optical variability of the quasar PG 1302-102 with 
a mean observed period of 1,884 ± 88 days. It was identified in a search for
periodic variability in a data set of light curves for 247,000 known,
spectroscopically confirmed quasars with a temporal baseline of about 9 years.
Although the interpretation of this phenomenon is still uncertain, the most
plausible mechanisms involve a binary system of two supermassive black holes with
a subparsec separation. Such systems are an expected consequence of galaxy
mergers and can provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and
evolution.

Proper positioning of organelles by cytoskeleton-based motor proteins underlies
cellular events such as signalling, polarization and growth. For many organelles,
however, the precise connection between position and function has remained
unclear, because strategies to control intracellular organelle positioning with
spatiotemporal precision are lacking. Here we establish optical control of
intracellular transport by using light-sensitive heterodimerization to recruit
specific cytoskeletal motor proteins (kinesin, dynein or myosin) to selected
cargoes. We demonstrate that the motility of peroxisomes, recycling endosomes and
mitochondria can be locally and repeatedly induced or stopped, allowing rapid
organelle repositioning. We applied this approach in primary rat hippocampal
neurons to test how local positioning of recycling endosomes contributes to axon 
outgrowth and found that dynein-driven removal of endosomes from axonal growth
cones reversibly suppressed axon growth, whereas kinesin-driven endosome
enrichment enhanced growth. Our strategy for optogenetic control of organelle
positioning will be widely applicable to explore site-specific organelle
functions in different model systems.

Myocardial infarction (MI), a leading cause of death around the world, displays a
complex pattern of inheritance. When MI occurs early in life, genetic inheritance
is a major component to risk. Previously, rare mutations in low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) genes have been shown to contribute to MI risk in individual
families, whereas common variants at more than 45 loci have been associated with 
MI risk in the population. Here we evaluate how rare mutations contribute to
early-onset MI risk in the population. We sequenced the protein-coding regions of
9,793 genomes from patients with MI at an early age (≤50 years in males and ≤60
years in females) along with MI-free controls. We identified two genes in which
rare coding-sequence mutations were more frequent in MI cases versus controls at 
exome-wide significance. At low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), carriers of 
rare non-synonymous mutations were at 4.2-fold increased risk for MI; carriers of
null alleles at LDLR were at even higher risk (13-fold difference). Approximately
2% of early MI cases harbour a rare, damaging mutation in LDLR; this estimate is 
similar to one made more than 40 years ago using an analysis of total
cholesterol. Among controls, about 1 in 217 carried an LDLR coding-sequence
mutation and had plasma LDL cholesterol > 190 mg dl(-1). At apolipoprotein A-V
(APOA5), carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations were at 2.2-fold increased
risk for MI. When compared with non-carriers, LDLR mutation carriers had higher
plasma LDL cholesterol, whereas APOA5 mutation carriers had higher plasma
triglycerides. Recent evidence has connected MI risk with coding-sequence
mutations at two genes functionally related to APOA5, namely lipoprotein lipase
and apolipoprotein C-III (refs 18, 19). Combined, these observations suggest
that, as well as LDL cholesterol, disordered metabolism of triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins contributes to MI risk.

Horizontal gene transfer allows organisms to rapidly acquire adaptive traits.
Although documented instances of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to
eukaryotes remain rare, bacteria represent a rich source of new functions
potentially available for co-option. One benefit that genes of bacterial origin
could provide to eukaryotes is the capacity to produce antibacterials, which have
evolved in prokaryotes as the result of eons of interbacterial competition. The
type VI secretion amidase effector (Tae) proteins are potent bacteriocidal
enzymes that degrade the cell wall when delivered into competing bacterial cells 
by the type VI secretion system. Here we show that tae genes have been
transferred to eukaryotes on at least six occasions, and that the resulting
domesticated amidase effector (dae) genes have been preserved for hundreds of
millions of years through purifying selection. We show that the dae genes
acquired eukaryotic secretion signals, are expressed within recipient organisms, 
and encode active antibacterial toxins that possess substrate specificity
matching extant Tae proteins of the same lineage. Finally, we show that a dae
gene in the deer tick Ixodes scapularis limits proliferation of Borrelia
burgdorferi, the aetiologic agent of Lyme disease. Our work demonstrates that a
family of horizontally acquired toxins honed to mediate interbacterial antagonism
confers previously undescribed antibacterial capacity to eukaryotes. We speculate
that the selective pressure imposed by competition between bacteria has produced 
a reservoir of genes encoding diverse antimicrobial functions that are tailored
for co-option by eukaryotic innate immune systems.

MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs expressed in different tissue and cell types 
that suppress the expression of target genes. As such, microRNAs are critical
cogs in numerous biological processes, and dysregulated microRNA expression is
correlated with many human diseases. Certain microRNAs, called oncomiRs, play a
causal role in the onset and maintenance of cancer when overexpressed. Tumours
that depend on these microRNAs are said to display oncomiR addiction. Some of the
most effective anticancer therapies target oncogenes such as EGFR and HER2;
similarly, inhibition of oncomiRs using antisense oligomers (that is, antimiRs)
is an evolving therapeutic strategy. However, the in vivo efficacy of current
antimiR technologies is hindered by physiological and cellular barriers to
delivery into targeted cells. Here we introduce a novel antimiR delivery platform
that targets the acidic tumour microenvironment, evades systemic clearance by the
liver, and facilitates cell entry via a non-endocytic pathway. We find that the
attachment of peptide nucleic acid antimiRs to a peptide with a low pH-induced
transmembrane structure (pHLIP) produces a novel construct that could target the 
tumour microenvironment, transport antimiRs across plasma membranes under acidic 
conditions such as those found in solid tumours (pH approximately 6), and
effectively inhibit the miR-155 oncomiR in a mouse model of lymphoma. This study 
introduces a new model for using antimiRs as anti-cancer drugs, which can have
broad impacts on the field of targeted drug delivery.

Biotin-dependent carboxylases are widely distributed in nature and have important
functions in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids, carbohydrates,
cholesterol and other compounds. Defective mutations in several of these enzymes 
have been linked to serious metabolic diseases in humans, and acetyl-CoA
carboxylase is a target for drug discovery in the treatment of diabetes, cancer
and other diseases. Here we report the identification and biochemical, structural
and functional characterizations of a novel single-chain (120 kDa), multi-domain 
biotin-dependent carboxylase in bacteria. It has preference for long-chain
acyl-CoA substrates, although it is also active towards short-chain and
medium-chain acyl-CoAs, and we have named it long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase. The
holoenzyme is a homo-hexamer with molecular mass of 720 kDa. The 3.0 Å crystal
structure of the long-chain acyl-CoA carboxylase holoenzyme from Mycobacterium
avium subspecies paratuberculosis revealed an architecture that is strikingly
different from those of related biotin-dependent carboxylases. In addition, the
domains of each monomer have no direct contact with each other. They are instead 
extensively swapped in the holoenzyme, such that one cycle of catalysis involves 
the participation of four monomers. Functional studies in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
suggest that the enzyme is involved in the utilization of selected carbon and
nitrogen sources.

Earth's magnetic field has been thought to arise from thermal convection of
molten iron alloy in the outer core, but recent density functional theory
calculations have suggested that the conductivity of iron is too high to support 
thermal convection, resulting in the investigation of chemically driven
convection. These calculations for resistivity were based on electron-phonon
scattering. Here we apply self-consistent density functional theory plus
dynamical mean-field theory (DFT + DMFT) to iron and find that at high
temperatures electron-electron scattering is comparable to the electron-phonon
scattering, bringing theory into agreement with experiments and solving the
transport problem in Earth's core. The conventional thermal dynamo picture is
safe. We find that electron-electron scattering of d electrons is important at
high temperatures in transition metals, in contrast to textbook analyses since
Mott, and that 4s electron contributions to transport are negligible, in contrast
to numerous models used for over fifty years. The DFT+DMFT method should be
applicable to other high-temperature systems where electron correlations are
important.

Metal-catalysed azidation of tertiary C-H bonds suitable for late-stage
functionalization.

Sharma A(1), Hartwig JF(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720,
USA.

Many enzymes oxidize unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds selectively to form
alcohols; however, biological systems do not possess enzymes that catalyse the
analogous aminations of C-H bonds. The absence of such enzymes limits the
discovery of potential medicinal candidates because nitrogen-containing groups
are crucial to the biological activity of therapeutic agents and clinically
useful natural products. In one prominent example illustrating the importance of 
incorporating nitrogen-based functionality, the conversion of the ketone of
erythromycin to the -N(Me)CH2- group in azithromycin leads to a compound that can
be dosed once daily with a shorter treatment time. For such reasons, synthetic
chemists have sought catalysts that directly convert C-H bonds to C-N bonds. Most
currently used catalysts for C-H bond amination are ill suited to the
intermolecular functionalization of complex molecules because they require excess
substrate or directing groups, harsh reaction conditions, weak or acidic C-H
bonds, or reagents containing specialized groups on the nitrogen atom. Among C-H 
bond amination reactions, those forming a C-N bond at a tertiary alkyl group
would be particularly valuable, because this linkage is difficult to form from
ketones or alcohols that might be created in a biosynthetic pathway by oxidation.
Here we report a mild, selective, iron-catalysed azidation of tertiary C-H bonds 
that occurs without excess of the valuable substrate. The reaction tolerates
aqueous environments and is suitable for the functionalization of complex
structures in the late stages of a multistep synthesis. Moreover, this azidation 
makes it possible to install a range of nitrogen-based functional groups,
including those from Huisgen 'click' cycloadditions and the Staudinger ligation. 
We anticipate that these reactions will create opportunities to modify natural
products, their precursors and their derivatives to produce analogues that
contain different polarity and charge as a result of nitrogen-containing groups. 
It could also be used to help identify targets of biologically active molecules
by creating a point of attachment--for example, to fluorescent tags or 'handles' 
for affinity chromatography--directly on complex molecular structures.

Hydrophobic particles in water and hydrophilic particles in oil aggregate, but
can form colloidal dispersions if their surfaces are chemically camouflaged with 
surfactants, organic tethers, adsorbed polymers or other particles that impart
affinity for the solvent and increase interparticle repulsion. A different
strategy for modulating the interaction between a solid and a liquid uses surface
corrugation, which gives rise to unique wetting behaviour. Here we show that this
topographical effect can also be used to disperse particles in a wide range of
solvents without recourse to chemicals to camouflage the particles' surfaces: we 
produce micrometre-sized particles that are coated with stiff, nanoscale spikes
and exhibit long-term colloidal stability in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
media. We find that these 'hedgehog' particles do not interpenetrate each other
with their spikes, which markedly decreases the contact area between the
particles and, therefore, the attractive forces between them. The trapping of air
in aqueous dispersions, solvent autoionization at highly developed interfaces,
and long-range electrostatic repulsion in organic media also contribute to the
colloidal stability of our particles. The unusual dispersion behaviour of our
hedgehog particles, overturning the notion that like dissolves like, might help
to mitigate adverse environmental effects of the use of surfactants and volatile 
organic solvents, and deepens our understanding of interparticle interactions and
nanoscale colloidal chemistry.

All evidence so far suggests that the absolute spatial orientation of an
experiment never affects its outcome. This is reflected in the standard model of 
particle physics by requiring all particles and fields to be invariant under
Lorentz transformations. The best-known tests of this important cornerstone of
physics are Michelson-Morley-type experiments verifying the isotropy of the speed
of light. For matter, Hughes-Drever-type experiments test whether the kinetic
energy of particles is independent of the direction of their velocity, that is,
whether their dispersion relations are isotropic. To provide more guidance for
physics beyond the standard model, refined experimental verifications of Lorentz 
symmetry are desirable. Here we search for violation of Lorentz symmetry for
electrons by performing an electronic analogue of a Michelson-Morley experiment. 
We split an electron wave packet bound inside a calcium ion into two parts with
different orientations and recombine them after a time evolution of
95 milliseconds. As the Earth rotates, the absolute spatial orientation of the
two parts of the wave packet changes, and anisotropies in the electron dispersion
will modify the phase of the interference signal. To remove noise, we prepare a
pair of calcium ions in a superposition of two decoherence-free states, thereby
rejecting magnetic field fluctuations common to both ions. After a 23-hour
measurement, we find a limit of h × 11 millihertz (h is Planck's constant) on the
energy variations, verifying the isotropy of the electron's dispersion relation
at the level of one part in 10(18), a 100-fold improvement on previous work.
Alternatively, we can interpret our result as testing the rotational invariance
of the Coulomb potential. Assuming that Lorentz symmetry holds for electrons and 
that the photon dispersion relation governs the Coulomb force, we obtain a
fivefold-improved limit on anisotropies in the speed of light. Our result probes 
Lorentz symmetry violation at levels comparable to the ratio between the
electroweak and Planck energy scales. Our experiment demonstrates the potential
of quantum information techniques in the search for physics beyond the standard
model.

The Cancer Genome Atlas profiled 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
(HNSCCs) to provide a comprehensive landscape of somatic genomic alterations.
Here we show that human-papillomavirus-associated tumours are dominated by
helical domain mutations of the oncogene PIK3CA, novel alterations involving loss
of TRAF3, and amplification of the cell cycle gene E2F1. Smoking-related HNSCCs
demonstrate near universal loss-of-function TP53 mutations and CDKN2A
inactivation with frequent copy number alterations including amplification of
3q26/28 and 11q13/22. A subgroup of oral cavity tumours with favourable clinical 
outcomes displayed infrequent copy number alterations in conjunction with
activating mutations of HRAS or PIK3CA, coupled with inactivating mutations of
CASP8, NOTCH1 and TP53. Other distinct subgroups contained loss-of-function
alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, WNT pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and
activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumours.
Therapeutic candidate alterations were identified in most HNSCCs.

Most present-generation climate models simulate an increase in global-mean
surface temperature (GMST) since 1998, whereas observations suggest a warming
hiatus. It is unclear to what extent this mismatch is caused by incorrect model
forcing, by incorrect model response to forcing or by random factors. Here we
analyse simulations and observations of GMST from 1900 to 2012, and show that the
distribution of simulated 15-year trends shows no systematic bias against the
observations. Using a multiple regression approach that is physically motivated
by surface energy balance, we isolate the impact of radiative forcing, climate
feedback and ocean heat uptake on GMST--with the regression residual interpreted 
as internal variability--and assess all possible 15- and 62-year trends. The
differences between simulated and observed trends are dominated by random
internal variability over the shorter timescale and by variations in the
radiative forcings used to drive models over the longer timescale. For either
trend length, spread in simulated climate feedback leaves no traceable imprint on
GMST trends or, consequently, on the difference between simulations and
observations. The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the
response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations
therefore seems to be unfounded.

The ages of the most common stars--low-mass (cool) stars like the Sun, and
smaller--are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods use stellar
properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard to measure. The
rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars
steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore
can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of
gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation
period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is
best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with
well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters 
with ages of less than about one billion years, and gyrochronology ages for older
stars have been inferred from model predictions. Here we report rotation period
measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The 
periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar
mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per
cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.

Broadly, tissue regeneration is achieved in two ways: by proliferation of common 
differentiated cells and/or by deployment of specialized stem/progenitor cells.
Which of these pathways applies is both organ- and injury-specific. Current
models in the lung posit that epithelial repair can be attributed to cells
expressing mature lineage markers. By contrast, here we define the regenerative
role of previously uncharacterized, rare lineage-negative epithelial
stem/progenitor (LNEP) cells present within normal distal lung. Quiescent LNEPs
activate a ΔNp63 (a p63 splice variant) and cytokeratin 5 remodelling program
after influenza or bleomycin injury in mice. Activated cells proliferate and
migrate widely to occupy heavily injured areas depleted of mature lineages, at
which point they differentiate towards mature epithelium. Lineage tracing
revealed scant contribution of pre-existing mature epithelial cells in such
repair, whereas orthotopic transplantation of LNEPs, isolated by a definitive
surface profile identified through single-cell sequencing, directly demonstrated 
the proliferative capacity and multipotency of this population. LNEPs require
Notch signalling to activate the ΔNp63 and cytokeratin 5 program, and subsequent 
Notch blockade promotes an alveolar cell fate. Persistent Notch signalling after 
injury led to parenchymal 'micro-honeycombing' (alveolar cysts), indicative of
failed regeneration. Lungs from patients with fibrosis show analogous honeycomb
cysts with evidence of hyperactive Notch signalling. Our findings indicate that
distinct stem/progenitor cell pools repopulate injured tissue depending on the
extent of the injury, and the outcomes of regeneration or fibrosis may depend in 
part on the dynamics of LNEP Notch signalling.

The plant cell wall is an important factor for determining cell shape, function
and response to the environment. Secondary cell walls, such as those found in
xylem, are composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin and account for the
bulk of plant biomass. The coordination between transcriptional regulation of
synthesis for each polymer is complex and vital to cell function. A regulatory
hierarchy of developmental switches has been proposed, although the full
complement of regulators remains unknown. Here we present a protein-DNA network
between Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors and secondary cell wall
metabolic genes with gene expression regulated by a series of feed-forward loops.
This model allowed us to develop and validate new hypotheses about secondary wall
gene regulation under abiotic stress. Distinct stresses are able to perturb
targeted genes to potentially promote functional adaptation. These interactions
will serve as a foundation for understanding the regulation of a complex,
integral plant component.

Systematic interrogation of gene function requires the ability to perturb gene
expression in a robust and generalizable manner. Here we describe
structure-guided engineering of a CRISPR-Cas9 complex to mediate efficient
transcriptional activation at endogenous genomic loci. We used these engineered
Cas9 activation complexes to investigate single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting rules
for effective transcriptional activation, to demonstrate multiplexed activation
of ten genes simultaneously, and to upregulate long intergenic non-coding RNA
(lincRNA) transcripts. We also synthesized a library consisting of 70,290 guides 
targeting all human RefSeq coding isoforms to screen for genes that, upon
activation, confer resistance to a BRAF inhibitor. The top hits included genes
previously shown to be able to confer resistance, and novel candidates were
validated using individual sgRNA and complementary DNA overexpression. A gene
expression signature based on the top screening hits correlated with markers of
BRAF inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived samples. These
results collectively demonstrate the potential of Cas9-based activators as a
powerful genetic perturbation technology.

Pathogenic mycobacteria induce the formation of complex cellular aggregates
called granulomas that are the hallmark of tuberculosis. Here we examine the
development and consequences of vascularization of the tuberculous granuloma in
the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, which is characterized by
organized granulomas with necrotic cores that bear striking resemblance to those 
of human tuberculosis. Using intravital microscopy in the transparent larval
zebrafish, we show that granuloma formation is intimately associated with
angiogenesis. The initiation of angiogenesis in turn coincides with the
generation of local hypoxia and transcriptional induction of the canonical
pro-angiogenic molecule Vegfaa. Pharmacological inhibition of the Vegf pathway
suppresses granuloma-associated angiogenesis, reduces infection burden and limits
dissemination. Moreover, anti-angiogenic therapies synergize with the first-line 
anti-tubercular antibiotic rifampicin, as well as with the antibiotic
metronidazole, which targets hypoxic bacterial populations. Our data indicate
that mycobacteria induce granuloma-associated angiogenesis, which promotes
mycobacterial growth and increases spread of infection to new tissue sites. We
propose the use of anti-angiogenic agents, now being used in cancer regimens, as 
a host-targeting tuberculosis therapy, particularly in extensively drug-resistant
disease for which current antibiotic regimens are largely ineffective.

Oxidative stress promotes genomic instability and human diseases. A common
oxidized nucleoside is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, which is found both
in DNA (8-oxo-G) and as a free nucleotide (8-oxo-dGTP). Nucleotide pools are
especially vulnerable to oxidative damage. Therefore cells encode an enzyme
(MutT/MTH1) that removes free oxidized nucleotides. This cleansing function is
required for cancer cell survival and to modulate Escherichia coli antibiotic
sensitivity in a DNA polymerase (pol)-dependent manner. How polymerases
discriminate between damaged and non-damaged nucleotides is not well understood. 
This analysis is essential given the role of oxidized nucleotides in mutagenesis,
cancer therapeutics, and bacterial antibiotics. Even with cellular sanitizing
activities, nucleotide pools contain enough 8-oxo-dGTP to promote mutagenesis.
This arises from the dual coding potential where 8-oxo-dGTP(anti) base pairs with
cytosine and 8-oxo-dGTP(syn) uses its Hoogsteen edge to base pair with adenine.
Here we use time-lapse crystallography to follow 8-oxo-dGTP insertion opposite
adenine or cytosine with human pol β, to reveal that insertion is accommodated in
either the syn- or anti-conformation, respectively. For 8-oxo-dGTP(anti)
insertion, a novel divalent metal relieves repulsive interactions between the
adducted guanine base and the triphosphate of the oxidized nucleotide. With
either templating base, hydrogen-bonding interactions between the bases are lost 
as the enzyme reopens after catalysis, leading to a cytotoxic nicked DNA repair
intermediate. Combining structural snapshots with kinetic and computational
analysis reveals how 8-oxo-dGTP uses charge modulation during insertion that can 
lead to a blocked DNA repair intermediate.

TP53 is commonly altered in human cancer, and Tp53 reactivation suppresses
tumours in vivo in mice (TP53 and Tp53 are also known as p53). This strategy has 
proven difficult to implement therapeutically, and here we examine an alternative
strategy by manipulating the p53 family members, Tp63 and Tp73 (also known as p63
and p73, respectively). The acidic transactivation-domain-bearing (TA) isoforms
of p63 and p73 structurally and functionally resemble p53, whereas the ΔN
isoforms (lacking the acidic transactivation domain) of p63 and p73 are
frequently overexpressed in cancer and act primarily in a dominant-negative
fashion against p53, TAp63 and TAp73 to inhibit their tumour-suppressive
functions. The p53 family interacts extensively in cellular processes that
promote tumour suppression, such as apoptosis and autophagy, thus a clear
understanding of this interplay in cancer is needed to treat tumours with
alterations in the p53 pathway. Here we show that deletion of the ΔN isoforms of 
p63 or p73 leads to metabolic reprogramming and regression of p53-deficient
tumours through upregulation of IAPP, the gene that encodes amylin, a
37-amino-acid peptide co-secreted with insulin by the β cells of the pancreas. We
found that IAPP is causally involved in this tumour regression and that amylin
functions through the calcitonin receptor (CalcR) and receptor activity modifying
protein 3 (RAMP3) to inhibit glycolysis and induce reactive oxygen species and
apoptosis. Pramlintide, a synthetic analogue of amylin that is currently used to 
treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, caused rapid tumour regression in p53-deficient
thymic lymphomas, representing a novel strategy to target p53-deficient cancers.

The mitotic checkpoint complex binds a second CDC20 to inhibit active APC/C.

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) maintains genomic stability by delaying
chromosome segregation until the last chromosome has attached to the mitotic
spindle. The SAC prevents the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)
ubiquitin ligase from recognizing cyclin B and securin by catalysing the
incorporation of the APC/C co-activator, CDC20, into a complex called the mitotic
checkpoint complex (MCC). The SAC works through unattached kinetochores
generating a diffusible 'wait anaphase' signal that inhibits the APC/C in the
cytoplasm, but the nature of this signal remains a key unsolved problem.
Moreover, the SAC and the APC/C are highly responsive to each other: the APC/C
quickly targets cyclin B and securin once all the chromosomes attach in
metaphase, but is rapidly inhibited should kinetochore attachment be perturbed.
How this is achieved is also unknown. Here, we show that the MCC can inhibit a
second CDC20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. We show how the MCC 
inhibits active APC/C and that this is essential for the SAC. Moreover, this
mechanism can prevent anaphase in the absence of kinetochore signalling. Thus, we
propose that the diffusible 'wait anaphase' signal could be the MCC itself, and
explain how reactivating the SAC can rapidly inhibit active APC/C.

Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary
fibrosis involve the progressive and inexorable destruction of oxygen exchange
surfaces and airways, and have emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide.
Mitigating therapies, aside from impractical organ transplantation, remain
limited and the possibility of regenerative medicine has lacked empirical
support. However, it is clinically known that patients who survive sudden,
massive loss of lung tissue from necrotizing pneumonia or acute respiratory
distress syndrome often recover full pulmonary function within six months.
Correspondingly, we recently demonstrated lung regeneration in mice following
H1N1 influenza virus infection, and linked distal airway stem cells expressing
Trp63 (p63) and keratin 5, called DASC(p63/Krt5), to this process. Here we show
that pre-existing, intrinsically committed DASC(p63/Krt5) undergo a proliferative
expansion in response to influenza-induced lung damage, and assemble into nascent
alveoli at sites of interstitial lung inflammation. We also show that the
selective ablation of DASC(p63/Krt5) in vivo prevents this regeneration, leading 
to pre-fibrotic lesions and deficient oxygen exchange. Finally, we demonstrate
that single DASC(p63/Krt5)-derived pedigrees differentiate to type I and type II 
pneumocytes as well as bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation to
infected lung and also minimize the structural consequences of endogenous stem
cell loss on this process. The ability to propagate these cells in culture while 
maintaining their intrinsic lineage commitment suggests their potential in stem
cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases.

The human genome is arguably the most complete mammalian reference assembly, yet 
more than 160 euchromatic gaps remain and aspects of its structural variation
remain poorly understood ten years after its completion. To identify missing
sequence and genetic variation, here we sequence and analyse a haploid human
genome (CHM1) using single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing. We close or extend
55% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the human GRCh37 reference genome--78% 
of which carried long runs of degenerate short tandem repeats, often several
kilobases in length, embedded within (G+C)-rich genomic regions. We resolve the
complete sequence of 26,079 euchromatic structural variants at the base-pair
level, including inversions, complex insertions and long tracts of tandem
repeats. Most have not been previously reported, with the greatest increases in
sensitivity occurring for events less than 5 kilobases in size. Compared to the
human reference, we find a significant insertional bias (3:1) in regions
corresponding to complex insertions and long short tandem repeats. Our results
suggest a greater complexity of the human genome in the form of variation of
longer and more complex repetitive DNA that can now be largely resolved with the 
application of this longer-read sequencing technology.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that is essential for
various developmental processes through regulating gene expression, genomic
imprinting, and epigenetic inheritance. Mammalian genomic DNA methylation is
established during embryogenesis by de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and
DNMT3B, and the methylation patterns vary with developmental stages and cell
types. DNA methyltransferase 3-like protein (DNMT3L) is a catalytically inactive 
paralogue of DNMT3 enzymes, which stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dnmt3a.
Recent studies have established a connection between DNA methylation and histone 
modifications, and revealed a histone-guided mechanism for the establishment of
DNA methylation. The ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain of Dnmt3a recognizes
unmethylated histone H3 (H3K4me0). The histone H3 tail stimulates the enzymatic
activity of Dnmt3a in vitro, whereas the molecular mechanism remains elusive.
Here we show that DNMT3A exists in an autoinhibitory form and that the histone H3
tail stimulates its activity in a DNMT3L-independent manner. We determine the
crystal structures of DNMT3A-DNMT3L (autoinhibitory form) and DNMT3A-DNMT3L-H3
(active form) complexes at 3.82 and 2.90 Å resolution, respectively. Structural
and biochemical analyses indicate that the ADD domain of DNMT3A interacts with
and inhibits enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain (CD) through blocking its
DNA-binding affinity. Histone H3 (but not H3K4me3) disrupts ADD-CD interaction,
induces a large movement of the ADD domain, and thus releases the autoinhibition 
of DNMT3A. The finding adds another layer of regulation of DNA methylation to
ensure that the enzyme is mainly activated at proper targeting loci when
unmethylated H3K4 is present, and strongly supports a negative correlation
between H3K4me3 and DNA methylation across the mammalian genome. Our study
provides a new insight into an unexpected autoinhibition and histone H3-induced
activation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase after its initial genomic
positioning.

Estimating and accounting for twentieth-century global mean sea level (GMSL) rise
is critical to characterizing current and future human-induced sea-level change. 
Several previous analyses of tide gauge records--employing different methods to
accommodate the spatial sparsity and temporal incompleteness of the data and to
constrain the geometry of long-term sea-level change--have concluded that GMSL
rose over the twentieth century at a mean rate of 1.6 to 1.9 millimetres per
year. Efforts to account for this rate by summing estimates of individual
contributions from glacier and ice-sheet mass loss, ocean thermal expansion, and 
changes in land water storage fall significantly short in the period before 1990.
The failure to close the budget of GMSL during this period has led to suggestions
that several contributions may have been systematically underestimated. However, 
the extent to which the limitations of tide gauge analyses have affected
estimates of the GMSL rate of change is unclear. Here we revisit estimates of
twentieth-century GMSL rise using probabilistic techniques and find a rate of
GMSL rise from 1901 to 1990 of 1.2 ± 0.2 millimetres per year (90% confidence
interval). Based on individual contributions tabulated in the Fifth Assessment
Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this estimate closes the
twentieth-century sea-level budget. Our analysis, which combines tide gauge
records with physics-based and model-derived geometries of the various
contributing signals, also indicates that GMSL rose at a rate of 3.0 ± 0.7
millimetres per year between 1993 and 2010, consistent with prior estimates from 
tide gauge records.The increase in rate relative to the 1901-90 trend is
accordingly larger than previously thought; this revision may affect some
projections of future sea-level rise.

Palaeomagnetic measurements of meteorites suggest that, shortly after the birth
of the Solar System, the molten metallic cores of many small planetary bodies
convected vigorously and were capable of generating magnetic fields. Convection
on these bodies is currently thought to have been thermally driven, implying that
magnetic activity would have been short-lived. Here we report a time-series
palaeomagnetic record derived from nanomagnetic imaging of the Imilac and Esquel 
pallasite meteorites, a group of meteorites consisting of centimetre-sized
metallic and silicate phases. We find a history of long-lived magnetic activity
on the pallasite parent body, capturing the decay and eventual shutdown of the
magnetic field as core solidification completed. We demonstrate that magnetic
activity driven by progressive solidification of an inner core is consistent with
our measured magnetic field characteristics and cooling rates.
Solidification-driven convection was probably common among small body cores, and,
in contrast to thermally driven convection, will have led to a relatively late
(hundreds of millions of years after accretion), long-lasting, intense and
widespread epoch of magnetic activity among these bodies in the early Solar
System.

Low-valent late transition-metal catalysis has become indispensable to chemical
synthesis, but homogeneous high-valent transition-metal catalysis is
underdeveloped, mainly owing to the reactivity of high-valent transition-metal
complexes and the challenges associated with synthesizing them. Here we report a 
carbon-carbon bond cleavage at ambient conditions by a Au(i) complex that
generates a stable Au(iii) cationic complex. In contrast to the well-established 
soft and carbophilic Au(i) catalyst, this Au(iii) complex exhibits hard,
oxophilic Lewis acidity. For example, we observed catalytic activation of
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes towards selective conjugate additions as well as
activation of an unsaturated aldehyde-allene for a [2 + 2] cycloaddition
reaction. The origin of the regioselectivity and catalytic activity was
elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis of an isolated Au(iii)-activated
cinnamaldehyde intermediate. The concepts revealed suggest a strategy for
accessing high-valent transition-metal catalysis from readily available
precursors.

Antibiotic resistance is spreading faster than the introduction of new compounds 
into clinical practice, causing a public health crisis. Most antibiotics were
produced by screening soil microorganisms, but this limited resource of
cultivable bacteria was overmined by the 1960s. Synthetic approaches to produce
antibiotics have been unable to replace this platform. Uncultured bacteria make
up approximately 99% of all species in external environments, and are an untapped
source of new antibiotics. We developed several methods to grow uncultured
organisms by cultivation in situ or by using specific growth factors. Here we
report a new antibiotic that we term teixobactin, discovered in a screen of
uncultured bacteria. Teixobactin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to a
highly conserved motif of lipid II (precursor of peptidoglycan) and lipid III
(precursor of cell wall teichoic acid). We did not obtain any mutants of
Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to teixobactin. The
properties of this compound suggest a path towards developing antibiotics that
are likely to avoid development of resistance.

Of the many materials and methodologies aimed at producing low-cost, efficient
photovoltaic cells, inorganic-organic lead halide perovskite materials appear
particularly promising for next-generation solar devices owing to their high
power conversion efficiency. The highest efficiencies reported for perovskite
solar cells so far have been obtained mainly with methylammonium lead halide
materials. Here we combine the promising-owing to its comparatively narrow
bandgap-but relatively unstable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with
methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) as the light-harvesting unit in a bilayer
solar-cell architecture. We investigated phase stability, morphology of the
perovskite layer, hysteresis in current-voltage characteristics, and overall
performance as a function of chemical composition. Our results show that
incorporation of MAPbBr3 into FAPbI3 stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI3
and improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to more than 18
per cent under a standard illumination of 100 milliwatts per square centimetre.
These findings further emphasize the versatility and performance potential of
inorganic-organic lead halide perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.

The kinetochore is the crucial apparatus regulating chromosome segregation in
mitosis and meiosis. Particularly in meiosis I, unlike in mitosis, sister
kinetochores are captured by microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole
(mono-orientation) and centromeric cohesion mediated by cohesin is protected in
the following anaphase. Although meiotic kinetochore factors have been identified
only in budding and fission yeasts, these molecules and their functions are
thought to have diverged earlier. Therefore, a conserved mechanism for meiotic
kinetochore regulation remains elusive. Here we have identified in mouse a
meiosis-specific kinetochore factor that we termed MEIKIN, which functions in
meiosis I but not in meiosis II or mitosis. MEIKIN plays a crucial role in both
mono-orientation and centromeric cohesion protection, partly by stabilizing the
localization of the cohesin protector shugoshin. These functions are mediated
mainly by the activity of Polo-like kinase PLK1, which is enriched to
kinetochores in a MEIKIN-dependent manner. Our integrative analysis indicates
that the long-awaited key regulator of meiotic kinetochore function is Meikin,
which is conserved from yeasts to humans.

During endocytosis, energy is invested to narrow the necks of cargo-containing
plasma membrane invaginations to radii at which the opposing segments
spontaneously coalesce, thereby leading to the detachment by scission of
endocytic uptake carriers. In the clathrin pathway, dynamin uses mechanical
energy from GTP hydrolysis to this effect, assisted by the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs
(BAR) domain-containing protein endophilin. Clathrin-independent endocytic events
are often less reliant on dynamin, and whether in these cases BAR domain proteins
such as endophilin contribute to scission has remained unexplored. Here we show, 
in human and other mammalian cell lines, that endophilin-A2 (endoA2) specifically
and functionally associates with very early uptake structures that are induced by
the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins, which are both clathrin-independent
endocytic cargoes. In controlled in vitro systems, endoA2 reshapes membranes
before scission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endoA2, dynamin and actin
contribute in parallel to the scission of Shiga-toxin-induced tubules. Our
results establish a novel function of endoA2 in clathrin-independent endocytosis.
They document that distinct scission factors operate in an additive manner, and
predict that specificity within a given uptake process arises from defined
combinations of universal modules. Our findings highlight a previously unnoticed 
link between membrane scaffolding by endoA2 and pulling-force-driven dynamic
scission.

Endocytosis is required for internalization of micronutrients and turnover of
membrane components. Endophilin has been assigned as a component of
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Here we show in mammalian cells that endophilin
marks and controls a fast-acting tubulovesicular endocytic pathway that is
independent of AP2 and clathrin, activated upon ligand binding to cargo
receptors, inhibited by inhibitors of dynamin, Rac, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH
kinase, PAK1 and actin polymerization, and activated upon Cdc42 inhibition. This 
pathway is prominent at the leading edges of cells where
phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate-produced by the dephosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate by SHIP1 and SHIP2-recruits lamellipodin,
which in turn engages endophilin. This pathway mediates the ligand-triggered
uptake of several G-protein-coupled receptors such as α2a- and β1-adrenergic,
dopaminergic D3 and D4 receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4, the
receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR, HGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, NGFR and IGF1R, as well as
interleukin-2 receptor. We call this new endocytic route fast endophilin-mediated
endocytosis (FEME).

The incompleteness of the fossil record obscures the origin of many of the more
derived clades of vertebrates. One such group is the Ichthyopterygia, a clade of 
obligatory marine reptiles that appeared in the Early Triassic epoch, without any
known intermediates. Here we describe a basal ichthyosauriform from the upper
Lower Triassic (about 248 million years ago) of China, whose primitive skeleton
indicates possible amphibious habits. It is smaller than ichthyopterygians and
had unusually large flippers that probably allowed limited terrestrial
locomotion. It also retained characteristics of terrestrial diapsid reptiles,
including a short snout and body trunk. Unlike more-derived ichthyosauriforms, it
was probably a suction feeder. The new species supports the sister-group
relationships between ichthyosauriforms and Hupehsuchia, the two forming the
Ichthyosauromorpha. Basal ichthyosauromorphs are known exclusively from south
China, suggesting that the clade originated in the region, which formed a warm
and humid tropical archipelago in the Early Triassic. The oldest unequivocal
record of a sauropterygian is also from the same stratigraphic unit of the
region.

Inactivation of APC is a strongly predisposing event in the development of
colorectal cancer, prompting the search for vulnerabilities specific to cells
that have lost APC function. Signalling through the mTOR pathway is known to be
required for epithelial cell proliferation and tumour growth, and the current
paradigm suggests that a critical function of mTOR activity is to upregulate
translational initiation through phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (refs 6, 7). This model
predicts that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, which does not efficiently inhibit
4EBP1 (ref. 8), would be ineffective in limiting cancer progression in
APC-deficient lesions. Here we show in mice that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity
is absolutely required for the proliferation of Apc-deficient (but not wild-type)
enterocytes, revealing an unexpected opportunity for therapeutic intervention.
Although APC-deficient cells show the expected increases in protein synthesis,
our study reveals that it is translation elongation, and not initiation, which is
the rate-limiting component. Mechanistically, mTORC1-mediated inhibition of eEF2 
kinase is required for the proliferation of APC-deficient cells. Importantly,
treatment of established APC-deficient adenomas with rapamycin (which can target 
eEF2 through the mTORC1-S6K-eEF2K axis) causes tumour cells to undergo growth
arrest and differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of
translation elongation using existing, clinically approved drugs, such as the
rapalogs, would provide clear therapeutic benefit for patients at high risk of
developing colorectal cancer.

Immunoglobulins protect against disease to a considerable extent by activating
complement and stimulatory immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment receptors (Ig
FcRs), and aggregating microbial pathogens. Yet IgG1, the predominant murine
serum Ig isotype, cannot activate complement by the classical pathway, binds more
avidly to an inhibitory than to stimulatory FcRs, and has limited ability to
aggregate pathogens. In these regards, it resembles human IgG4 (ref. 4). We
hypothesized that limited ability to activate effector mechanisms might protect
against immune complex immunopathology. Here we show that IgG1-deficient (γ1(-)) 
mice, immunized with a potent antigen, develop lethal renal disease soon after
they begin to produce antigen-specific antibody, whereas similarly immunized
wild-type mice remain healthy. Surprisingly, renal disease in this model is
complement and FcR independent and results from immune complex precipitation in
glomerular capillaries, as in some cryoglobulinaemic humans. IgG3, which
self-associates to form large immune complexes, accounts for more than 97% of the
mouse Ig in this cryoglobulin; furthermore, glomerular disease develops when mice
are injected with IgG3 anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) monoclonal antibody followed by 
a TNP-labelled protein. Renal disease is prevented in both active and passive
immunization models by antigen-specific IgG1; other isotypes are less potent at
preventing disease. These observations demonstrate the adaptive significance of
Ig isotypes that poorly activate effector mechanisms, reveal an
immune-complex-dependent, complement- and FcR-independent nephrotoxic mechanism, 
and suggest that isotypes that poorly activate effector mechanisms may be useful 
for inhibiting immune complex immunopathology.

Lantibiotics are a class of peptide antibiotics that contain one or more
thioether bonds. The lantibiotic nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that is widely
used as a food preservative to combat food-borne pathogens. Nisin contains
dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine residues that are formed by the dehydration of
Ser/Thr by the lantibiotic dehydratase NisB (ref. 2). Recent biochemical studies 
revealed that NisB glutamylates Ser/Thr side chains as part of the dehydration
process. However, the molecular mechanism by which NisB uses glutamate to
catalyse dehydration remains unresolved. Here we show that this process involves 
glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) to activate Ser/Thr residues. In addition, the 2.9-Å crystal
structure of NisB in complex with its substrate peptide NisA reveals the presence
of two separate domains that catalyse the Ser/Thr glutamylation and glutamate
elimination steps. The co-crystal structure also provides insights into substrate
recognition by lantibiotic dehydratases. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected
role for aminoacyl-tRNA in the formation of dehydroamino acids in lantibiotics,
and serve as a basis for the functional characterization of the many
lantibiotic-like dehydratases involved in the biosynthesis of other classes of
natural products.

Next-generation sequencing of human tumours has refined our understanding of the 
mutational processes operative in cancer initiation and progression, yet major
questions remain regarding the factors that induce driver mutations and the
processes that shape mutation selection during tumorigenesis. Here we performed
whole-exome sequencing on adenomas from three mouse models of non-small-cell lung
cancer, which were induced either by exposure to carcinogens (methyl-nitrosourea 
(MNU) and urethane) or by genetic activation of Kras (Kras(LA2)). Although the
MNU-induced tumours carried exactly the same initiating mutation in Kras as seen 
in the Kras(LA2) model (G12D), MNU tumours had an average of 192 non-synonymous, 
somatic single-nucleotide variants, compared with only six in tumours from the
Kras(LA2) model. By contrast, the Kras(LA2) tumours exhibited a significantly
higher level of aneuploidy and copy number alterations compared with the
carcinogen-induced tumours, suggesting that carcinogen-induced and genetically
engineered models lead to tumour development through different routes. The
wild-type allele of Kras has been shown to act as a tumour suppressor in mouse
models of non-small-cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that urethane-induced
tumours from wild-type mice carry mostly (94%) Kras Q61R mutations, whereas those
from Kras heterozygous animals carry mostly (92%) Kras Q61L mutations, indicating
a major role for germline Kras status in mutation selection during initiation.
The exome-wide mutation spectra in carcinogen-induced tumours overwhelmingly
display signatures of the initiating carcinogen, while adenocarcinomas acquire
additional C > T mutations at CpG sites. These data provide a basis for
understanding results from human tumour genome sequencing, which has identified
two broad categories of tumours based on the relative frequency of
single-nucleotide variations and copy number alterations, and underline the
importance of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra
seen in human cancers.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assembly proceeds in two stages.
First, the 55 kilodalton viral Gag polyprotein assembles into a hexameric protein
lattice at the plasma membrane of the infected cell, inducing budding and release
of an immature particle. Second, Gag is cleaved by the viral protease, leading to
internal rearrangement of the virus into the mature, infectious form. Immature
and mature HIV-1 particles are heterogeneous in size and morphology, preventing
high-resolution analysis of their protein arrangement in situ by conventional
structural biology methods. Here we apply cryo-electron tomography and
sub-tomogram averaging methods to resolve the structure of the capsid lattice
within intact immature HIV-1 particles at subnanometre resolution, allowing
unambiguous positioning of all α-helices. The resulting model reveals tertiary
and quaternary structural interactions that mediate HIV-1 assembly. Strikingly,
these interactions differ from those predicted by the current model based on in
vitro-assembled arrays of Gag-derived proteins from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus. To
validate this difference, we solve the structure of the capsid lattice within
intact immature Mason-Pfizer monkey virus particles. Comparison with the immature
HIV-1 structure reveals that retroviral capsid proteins, while having conserved
tertiary structures, adopt different quaternary arrangements during virus
assembly. The approach demonstrated here should be applicable to determine
structures of other proteins at subnanometre resolution within heterogeneous
environments.

Organohalide chemistry underpins many industrial and agricultural processes, and 
a large proportion of environmental pollutants are organohalides. Nevertheless,
organohalide chemistry is not exclusively of anthropogenic origin, with natural
abiotic and biological processes contributing to the global halide cycle.
Reductive dehalogenases are responsible for biological dehalogenation in
organohalide respiring bacteria, with substrates including polychlorinated
biphenyls or dioxins. Reductive dehalogenases form a distinct subfamily of
cobalamin (B12)-dependent enzymes that are usually membrane associated and oxygen
sensitive, hindering detailed studies. Here we report the characterization of a
soluble, oxygen-tolerant reductive dehalogenase and, by combining structure
determination with EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy and
simulation, show that a direct interaction between the cobalamin cobalt and the
substrate halogen underpins catalysis. In contrast to the carbon-cobalt bond
chemistry catalysed by the other cobalamin-dependent subfamilies, we propose that
reductive dehalogenases achieve reduction of the organohalide substrate via
halogen-cobalt bond formation. This presents a new model in both organohalide and
cobalamin (bio)chemistry that will guide future exploitation of these enzymes in 
bioremediation or biocatalysis.

Changing conditions on the Earth's surface can have a remarkable influence on the
composition of its overwhelmingly more massive interior. The global distribution 
of uranium is a notable example. In early Earth history, the continental crust
was enriched in uranium. Yet after the initial rise in atmospheric oxygen, about 
2.4 billion years ago, the aqueous mobility of oxidized uranium resulted in its
significant transport to the oceans and, ultimately, by means of subduction, back
to the mantle. Here we explore the isotopic characteristics of this global
uranium cycle. We show that the subducted flux of uranium is isotopically
distinct, with high (238)U/(235)U ratios, as a result of alteration processes at 
the bottom of an oxic ocean. We also find that mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs)
have (238)U/(235)U ratios higher than does the bulk Earth, confirming the
widespread pollution of the upper mantle with this recycled uranium. Although
many ocean island basalts (OIBs) are argued to contain a recycled component,
their uranium isotopic compositions do not differ from those of the bulk Earth.
Because subducted uranium was probably isotopically unfractionated before full
oceanic oxidation, about 600 million years ago, this observation reflects the
greater antiquity of OIB sources. Elemental and isotope systematics of uranium in
OIBs are strikingly consistent with previous OIB lead model ages, indicating that
these mantle reservoirs formed between 2.4 and 1.8 billion years ago. In
contrast, the uranium isotopic composition of MORB requires the convective
stirring of recycled uranium throughout the upper mantle within the past 600
million years.

The development of new reactions forming asymmetric carbon-carbon bonds has
enabled chemists to synthesize a broad range of important carbon-containing
molecules, including pharmaceutical agents, fragrances and polymers. Most
strategies to obtain enantiomerically enriched molecules rely on either
generating new stereogenic centres from prochiral substrates or resolving racemic
mixtures of enantiomers. An alternative strategy--dynamic kinetic asymmetric
transformation--involves the transformation of a racemic starting material into a
single enantiomer product, with greater than 50 per cent maximum yield. The use
of stabilized nucleophiles (pKa < 25, where Ka is the acid dissociation constant)
in palladium-catalysed asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions has proved to be
extremely versatile in these processes. Conversely, the use of non-stabilized
nucleophiles in such reactions is difficult and remains a key challenge. Here we 
report a copper-catalysed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation using racemic
substrates and alkyl nucleophiles. These nucleophiles have a pKa of ≥50, more
than 25 orders of magnitude more basic than the nucleophiles that are typically
used in such transformations. Organometallic reagents are generated in situ from 
alkenes by hydrometallation and give highly enantioenriched products under mild
reaction conditions. The method is used to synthesize natural products that
possess activity against tuberculosis and leprosy, and an inhibitor of
para-aminobenzoate biosynthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction
proceeds through a rapidly isomerizing intermediate. We anticipate that this
approach will be a valuable complement to existing asymmetric catalytic methods.

The structure of water near non-polar molecular fragments or surfaces mediates
the hydrophobic interactions that underlie a broad range of interfacial,
colloidal and biophysical phenomena. Substantial progress over the past decade
has improved our understanding of hydrophobic interactions in simple model
systems, but most biologically and technologically relevant structures contain
non-polar domains in close proximity to polar and charged functional groups.
Theories and simulations exploring such nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity
find it can have an important effect, but the influence of this heterogeneity on 
hydrophobic interactions has not been tested experimentally. Here we report
chemical force microscopy measurements on alkyl-functionalized surfaces that
reveal a dramatic change in the surfaces' hydrophobic interaction strengths on
co-immobilization of amine or guanidine groups. Protonation of amine groups
doubles the strength of hydrophobic interactions, and guanidinium groups
eliminate measurable hydrophobic interactions in all pH ranges investigated. We
see these divergent effects of proximally immobilized cations also in
single-molecule measurements on conformationally stable β-peptides with non-polar
subunits located one nanometre from either amine- or guanidine-bearing subunits. 
Our results demonstrate the importance of nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity,
with hydrophobicity not an intrinsic property of any given non-polar domain but
strongly modulated by functional groups located as far away as one nanometre. The
judicious placing of charged groups near hydrophobic domains thus provides a
strategy for tuning hydrophobic driving forces to optimize molecular recognition 
or self-assembly processes.

The propagation and transport of electrons in crystals is a fundamental process
pertaining to the functioning of most electronic devices. Microscopic theories
describe this phenomenon as being based on the motion of Bloch wave packets.
These wave packets are superpositions of individual Bloch states with the group
velocity determined by the dispersion of the electronic band structure near the
central wavevector in momentum space. This concept has been verified
experimentally in artificial superlattices by the observation of Bloch
oscillations--periodic oscillations of electrons in real and momentum space. Here
we present a direct observation of electron wave packet motion in a real-space
and real-time experiment, on length and time scales shorter than the Bloch
oscillation amplitude and period. We show that attosecond metrology (1 as =
10(-18) seconds) now enables quantitative insight into weakly disturbed electron 
wave packet propagation on the atomic length scale without being hampered by
scattering effects, which inevitably occur over macroscopic propagation length
scales. We use sub-femtosecond (less than 10(-15) seconds) extreme-ultraviolet
light pulses to launch photoelectron wave packets inside a tungsten crystal that 
is covered by magnesium films of varied, well-defined thicknesses of a few
ångströms. Probing the moment of arrival of the wave packets at the surface with 
attosecond precision reveals free-electron-like, ballistic propagation behaviour 
inside the magnesium adlayer--constituting the semi-classical limit of Bloch wave
packet motion. Real-time access to electron transport through atomic layers and
interfaces promises unprecedented insight into phenomena that may enable the
scaling of electronic and photonic circuits to atomic dimensions. In addition,
this experiment allows us to determine the penetration depth of electrical fields
at optical frequencies at solid interfaces on the atomic scale.

Chondrules are the millimetre-scale, previously molten, spherules found in most
meteorites. Before chondrules formed, large differentiating planetesimals had
already accreted. Volatile-rich olivine reveals that chondrules formed in
extremely solid-rich environments, more like impact plumes than the solar nebula.
The unique chondrules in CB chondrites probably formed in a vapour-melt plume
produced by a hypervelocity impact with an impact velocity greater than 10
kilometres per second. An acceptable formation model for the overwhelming
majority of chondrules, however, has not been established. Here we report that
impacts can produce enough chondrules during the first five million years of
planetary accretion to explain their observed abundance. Building on a previous
study of impact jetting, we simulate protoplanetary impacts, finding that
material is melted and ejected at high speed when the impact velocity exceeds 2.5
kilometres per second. Using a Monte Carlo accretion code, we estimate the
location, timing, sizes, and velocities of chondrule-forming impacts. Ejecta size
estimates indicate that jetted melt will form millimetre-scale droplets. Our
radiative transfer models show that these droplets experience the expected
cooling rates of ten to a thousand kelvin per hour. An impact origin for
chondrules implies that meteorites are a byproduct of planet formation rather
than leftover building material.

Cytosine methylation is a DNA modification generally associated with
transcriptional silencing. Factors that regulate methylation have been linked to 
human disease, yet how they contribute to malignances remains largely unknown.
Genomic maps of DNA methylation have revealed unexpected dynamics at gene
regulatory regions, including active demethylation by TET proteins at binding
sites for transcription factors. These observations indicate that the underlying 
DNA sequence largely accounts for local patterns of methylation. As a result,
this mark is highly informative when studying gene regulation in normal and
diseased cells, and it can potentially function as a biomarker. Although these
findings challenge the view that methylation is generally instructive for gene
silencing, several open questions remain, including how methylation is targeted
and recognized and in what context it affects genome readout.

Regulated cell death has essential functions in development and in adult tissue
homeostasis. Necroptosis is a newly discovered pathway of regulated necrosis that
requires the proteins RIPK3 and MLKL and is induced by death receptors,
interferons, toll-like receptors, intracellular RNA and DNA sensors, and probably
other mediators. RIPK1 has important kinase-dependent and scaffolding functions
that inhibit or trigger necroptosis and apoptosis. Mouse-model studies have
revealed important functions for necroptosis in inflammation and suggested that
it could be implicated in the pathogenesis of many human inflammatory diseases.
We discuss the mechanisms regulating necroptosis and its potential role in
inflammation and disease.

The ability to sense and respond to fluctuations in environmental nutrient levels
is a requisite for life. Nutrient scarcity is a selective pressure that has
shaped the evolution of most cellular processes. Different pathways that detect
intracellular and extracellular levels of sugars, amino acids, lipids and
surrogate metabolites are integrated and coordinated at the organismal level
through hormonal signals. During food abundance, nutrient-sensing pathways engage
anabolism and storage, whereas scarcity triggers homeostatic mechanisms, such as 
the mobilization of internal stores through autophagy. Nutrient-sensing pathways 
are commonly deregulated in human metabolic diseases.

The innate immune system is composed of a diverse array of evolutionarily ancient
haematopoietic cell types, including dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages and 
granulocytes. These cell populations collaborate with each other, with the
adaptive immune system and with non-haematopoietic cells to promote immunity,
inflammation and tissue repair. Innate lymphoid cells are the most recently
identified constituents of the innate immune system and have been the focus of
intense investigation over the past five years. We summarize the studies that
formally identified innate lymphoid cells and highlight their emerging roles in
controlling tissue homeostasis in the context of infection, chronic inflammation,
metabolic disease and cancer.

The amygdala has long been associated with emotion and motivation, playing an
essential part in processing both fearful and rewarding environmental stimuli.
How can a single structure be crucial for such different functions? With recent
technological advances that allow for causal investigations of specific neural
circuit elements, we can now begin to map the complex anatomical connections of
the amygdala onto behavioural function. Understanding how the amygdala
contributes to a wide array of behaviours requires the study of distinct amygdala
circuits.

Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
persists in a stable latent reservoir, primarily in resting memory CD4(+) T
cells. This reservoir presents a major barrier to the cure of HIV-1 infection. To
purge the reservoir, pharmacological reactivation of latent HIV-1 has been
proposed and tested both in vitro and in vivo. A key remaining question is
whether virus-specific immune mechanisms, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTLs), can clear infected cells in ART-treated patients after latency is
reversed. Here we show that there is a striking all or none pattern for CTL
escape mutations in HIV-1 Gag epitopes. Unless ART is started early, the vast
majority (>98%) of latent viruses carry CTL escape mutations that render infected
cells insensitive to CTLs directed at common epitopes. To solve this problem, we 
identified CTLs that could recognize epitopes from latent HIV-1 that were
unmutated in every chronically infected patient tested. Upon stimulation, these
CTLs eliminated target cells infected with autologous virus derived from the
latent reservoir, both in vitro and in patient-derived humanized mice. The
predominance of CTL-resistant viruses in the latent reservoir poses a major
challenge to viral eradication. Our results demonstrate that chronically infected
patients retain a broad-spectrum viral-specific CTL response and that appropriate
boosting of this response may be required for the elimination of the latent
reservoir.

Sensorimotor control in vertebrates relies on internal models. When extending an 
arm to reach for an object, the brain uses predictive models of both limb
dynamics and target properties. Whether invertebrates use such models remains
unclear. Here we examine to what extent prey interception by dragonflies
(Plathemis lydia), a behaviour analogous to targeted reaching, requires internal 
models. By simultaneously tracking the position and orientation of a dragonfly's 
head and body during flight, we provide evidence that interception steering is
driven by forward and inverse models of dragonfly body dynamics and by models of 
prey motion. Predictive rotations of the dragonfly's head continuously track the 
prey's angular position. The head-body angles established by prey tracking appear
to guide systematic rotations of the dragonfly's body to align it with the prey's
flight path. Model-driven control thus underlies the bulk of interception
steering manoeuvres, while vision is used for reactions to unexpected prey
movements. These findings illuminate the computational sophistication with which 
insects construct behaviour.

Given the importance of Africa to studies of human origins and disease
susceptibility, detailed characterization of African genetic diversity is needed.
The African Genome Variation Project provides a resource with which to design,
implement and interpret genomic studies in sub-Saharan Africa and worldwide. The 
African Genome Variation Project represents dense genotypes from 1,481
individuals and whole-genome sequences from 320 individuals across sub-Saharan
Africa. Using this resource, we find novel evidence of complex, regionally
distinct hunter-gatherer and Eurasian admixture across sub-Saharan Africa. We
identify new loci under selection, including loci related to malaria
susceptibility and hypertension. We show that modern imputation panels (sets of
reference genotypes from which unobserved or missing genotypes in study sets can 
be inferred) can identify association signals at highly differentiated loci
across populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Using whole-genome sequencing, we
demonstrate further improvements in imputation accuracy, strengthening the case
for large-scale sequencing efforts of diverse African haplotypes. Finally, we
present an efficient genotype array design capturing common genetic variation in 
Africa.

Obesity-linked insulin resistance is a major precursor to the development of
type 2 diabetes. Previous work has shown that phosphorylation of PPARγ
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) at serine 273 by cyclin-dependent 
kinase 5 (Cdk5) stimulates diabetogenic gene expression in adipose tissues.
Inhibition of this modification is a key therapeutic mechanism for anti-diabetic 
drugs that bind PPARγ, such as the thiazolidinediones and PPARγ partial agonists 
or non-agonists. For a better understanding of the importance of this
obesity-linked PPARγ phosphorylation, we created mice that ablated Cdk5
specifically in adipose tissues. These mice have both a paradoxical increase in
PPARγ phosphorylation at serine 273 and worsened insulin resistance. Unbiased
proteomic studies show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases
are activated in these knockout animals. Here we show that ERK directly
phosphorylates serine 273 of PPARγ in a robust manner and that Cdk5 suppresses
ERKs through direct action on a novel site in MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK).
Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MEK and ERK markedly improves insulin 
resistance in both obese wild-type and ob/ob mice, and also completely reverses
the deleterious effects of the Cdk5 ablation. These data show that an ERK/Cdk5
axis controls PPARγ function and suggest that MEK/ERK inhibitors may hold promise
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The mammalian taste system is responsible for sensing and responding to the five 
basic taste qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. Previously, we
showed that each taste is detected by dedicated taste receptor cells (TRCs) on
the tongue and palate epithelium. To understand how TRCs transmit information to 
higher neural centres, we examined the tuning properties of large ensembles of
neurons in the first neural station of the gustatory system. Here, we generated
and characterized a collection of transgenic mice expressing a genetically
encoded calcium indicator in central and peripheral neurons, and used a gradient 
refractive index microendoscope combined with high-resolution two-photon
microscopy to image taste responses from ganglion neurons buried deep at the base
of the brain. Our results reveal fine selectivity in the taste preference of
ganglion neurons; demonstrate a strong match between TRCs in the tongue and the
principal neural afferents relaying taste information to the brain; and expose
the highly specific transfer of taste information between taste cells and the
central nervous system.

Plant stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem are 
necessary for postembryonic development of aboveground tissues and roots,
respectively, while secondary vascular stem cells sustain vascular development.
WUSCHEL (WUS), a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the rib meristem
of the Arabidopsis SAM, is a key regulatory factor controlling SAM stem cell
populations, and is thought to establish the shoot stem cell niche through a
feedback circuit involving the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signalling pathway.
WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5), which is specifically expressed in the root
quiescent centre, defines quiescent centre identity and functions interchangeably
with WUS in the control of shoot and root stem cell niches. WOX4, expressed in
Arabidopsis procambial cells, defines the vascular stem cell niche. WUS/WOX
family proteins are evolutionarily and functionally conserved throughout the
plant kingdom and emerge as key actors in the specification and maintenance of
stem cells within all meristems. However, the nature of the genetic regime in
stem cell niches that centre on WOX gene function has been elusive, and molecular
links underlying conserved WUS/WOX function in stem cell niches remain unknown.
Here we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis HAIRY MERISTEM (HAM) family of
transcription regulators act as conserved interacting cofactors with WUS/WOX
proteins. HAM and WUS share common targets in vivo and their physical interaction
is important in driving downstream transcriptional programs and in promoting
shoot stem cell proliferation. Differences in the overlapping expression patterns
of WOX and HAM family members underlie the formation of diverse stem cell niche
locations, and the HAM family is essential for all of these stem cell niches.
These findings establish a new framework for the control of stem cell production 
during plant development.

For many decades comparative analyses of protein sequences and structures have
been used to investigate fundamental principles of molecular evolution. In
contrast, relatively little is known about the long-term evolution of species'
phenotypic and genetic properties. This represents an important gap in our
understanding of evolution, as exactly these proprieties play key roles in
natural selection and adaptation to diverse environments. Here we perform a
comparative analysis of bacterial growth and gene deletion phenotypes using
hundreds of genome-scale metabolic models. Overall, bacterial phenotypic
evolution can be described by a two-stage process with a rapid initial phenotypic
diversification followed by a slow long-term exponential divergence. The observed
average divergence trend, with approximately similar fractions of phenotypic
properties changing per unit time, continues for billions of years. We
experimentally confirm the predicted divergence trend using the phenotypic
profiles of 40 diverse bacterial species across more than 60 growth conditions.
Our analysis suggests that, at long evolutionary distances, gene essentiality is 
significantly more conserved than the ability to utilize different nutrients,
while synthetic lethality is significantly less conserved. We also find that
although a rapid phenotypic evolution is sometimes observed within the same
species, a transition from high to low phenotypic similarity occurs primarily at 
the genus level.

Site-specific gene addition can allow stable transgene expression for gene
therapy. When possible, this is preferred over the use of promiscuously
integrating vectors, which are sometimes associated with clonal expansion and
oncogenesis. Site-specific endonucleases that can induce high rates of targeted
genome editing are finding increasing applications in biological discovery and
gene therapy. However, two safety concerns persist: endonuclease-associated
adverse effects, both on-target and off-target; and oncogene activation caused by
promoter integration, even without nucleases. Here we perform recombinant
adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated promoterless gene targeting without
nucleases and demonstrate amelioration of the bleeding diathesis in haemophilia B
mice. In particular, we target a promoterless human coagulation factor IX (F9)
gene to the liver-expressed mouse albumin (Alb) locus. F9 is targeted, along with
a preceding 2A-peptide coding sequence, to be integrated just upstream to the Alb
stop codon. While F9 is fused to Alb at the DNA and RNA levels, two separate
proteins are synthesized by way of ribosomal skipping. Thus, F9 expression is
linked to robust hepatic albumin expression without disrupting it. We injected an
AAV8-F9 vector into neonatal and adult mice and achieved on-target integration
into ∼0.5% of the albumin alleles in hepatocytes. We established that F9 was
produced only from on-target integration, and ribosomal skipping was highly
efficient. Stable F9 plasma levels at 7-20% of normal were obtained, and treated 
F9-deficient mice had normal coagulation times. In conclusion, transgene
integration as a 2A-fusion to a highly expressed endogenous gene may obviate the 
requirement for nucleases and/or vector-borne promoters. This method may allow
for safe and efficacious gene targeting in both infants and adults by greatly
diminishing off-target effects while still providing therapeutic levels of
expression from integration.

T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3, also known as HAVCR2) is 
an activation-induced inhibitory molecule involved in tolerance and shown to
induce T-cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancers. Under some
conditions, TIM-3 expression has also been shown to be stimulatory. Considering
that TIM-3, like cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1
(PD-1), is being targeted for cancer immunotherapy, it is important to identify
the circumstances under which TIM-3 can inhibit and activate T-cell responses.
Here we show that TIM-3 is co-expressed and forms a heterodimer with
carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), another well-known
molecule expressed on activated T cells and involved in T-cell inhibition.
Biochemical, biophysical and X-ray crystallography studies show that the
membrane-distal immunoglobulin-variable (IgV)-like amino-terminal domain of each 
is crucial to these interactions. The presence of CEACAM1 endows TIM-3 with
inhibitory function. CEACAM1 facilitates the maturation and cell surface
expression of TIM-3 by forming a heterodimeric interaction in cis through the
highly related membrane-distal N-terminal domains of each molecule. CEACAM1 and
TIM-3 also bind in trans through their N-terminal domains. Both cis and trans
interactions between CEACAM1 and TIM-3 determine the tolerance-inducing function 
of TIM-3. In a mouse adoptive transfer colitis model, CEACAM1-deficient T cells
are hyper-inflammatory with reduced cell surface expression of TIM-3 and
regulatory cytokines, and this is restored by T-cell-specific CEACAM1 expression.
During chronic viral infection and in a tumour environment, CEACAM1 and TIM-3
mark exhausted T cells. Co-blockade of CEACAM1 and TIM-3 leads to enhancement of 
anti-tumour immune responses with improved elimination of tumours in mouse
colorectal cancer models. Thus, CEACAM1 serves as a heterophilic ligand for TIM-3
that is required for its ability to mediate T-cell inhibition, and this
interaction has a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumour
immunity.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters translocate substrates across cell
membranes, using energy harnessed from ATP binding and hydrolysis at their
nucleotide-binding domains. ABC exporters are present both in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, with examples implicated in multidrug resistance of pathogens and
cancer cells, as well as in many human diseases. TmrAB is a heterodimeric ABC
exporter from the thermophilic Gram-negative eubacterium Thermus thermophilus; it
is homologous to various multidrug transporters and contains one degenerate site 
with a non-catalytic residue next to the Walker B motif. Here we report a
subnanometre-resolution structure of detergent-solubilized TmrAB in a
nucleotide-free, inward-facing conformation by single-particle electron
cryomicroscopy. The reconstructions clearly resolve characteristic features of
ABC transporters, including helices in the transmembrane domain and
nucleotide-binding domains. A cavity in the transmembrane domain is accessible
laterally from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane as well as from the
cytoplasm, indicating that the transporter lies in an inward-facing open
conformation. The two nucleotide-binding domains remain in contact via their
carboxy-terminal helices. Furthermore, comparison between our structure and the
crystal structures of other ABC transporters suggests a possible trajectory of
conformational changes that involves a sliding and rotating motion between the
two nucleotide-binding domains during the transition from the inward-facing to
outward-facing conformations.

One of the primary challenges of our time is to feed a growing and more demanding
world population with reduced external inputs and minimal environmental impacts, 
all under more variable and extreme climate conditions in the future.
Conservation agriculture represents a set of three crop management principles
that has received strong international support to help address this challenge,
with recent conservation agriculture efforts focusing on smallholder farming
systems in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. However, conservation agriculture
is highly debated, with respect to both its effects on crop yields and its
applicability in different farming contexts. Here we conduct a global
meta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from 610 studies to compare
no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with
conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our
results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under
certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than
conventional tillage. Importantly, when no-till is combined with the other two
conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its
negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other
two principles significantly increases rainfed crop productivity in dry climates,
suggesting that it may become an important climate-change adaptation strategy for
ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation
agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the 
other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable
smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses
rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and
environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered, our analysis
indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable
intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed.

pathway.

Functional regeneration after nervous system injury requires transected axons to 
reconnect with their original target tissue. Axonal fusion, a spontaneous
regenerative mechanism identified in several species, provides an efficient means
of achieving target reconnection as a regrowing axon is able to contact and fuse 
with its own separated axon fragment, thereby re-establishing the original axonal
tract. Here we report a molecular characterization of this process in
Caenorhabditis elegans, revealing dynamic changes in the subcellular localization
of the EFF-1 fusogen after axotomy, and establishing phosphatidylserine (PS) and 
the PS receptor (PSR-1) as critical components for axonal fusion. PSR-1 functions
cell-autonomously in the regrowing neuron and, instead of acting in its canonical
signalling pathway, acts in a parallel phagocytic pathway that includes the
transthyretin protein TTR-52, as well as CED-7, NRF-5 and CED-6 (refs 9, 10, 11, 
12). We show that TTR-52 binds to PS exposed on the injured axon, and can restore
fusion several hours after injury. We propose that PS functions as a 'save-me'
signal for the distal fragment, allowing conserved apoptotic cell clearance
molecules to function in re-establishing axonal integrity during regeneration of 
the nervous system.

Policy makers have generally agreed that the average global temperature rise
caused by greenhouse gas emissions should not exceed 2 °C above the average
global temperature of pre-industrial times. It has been estimated that to have at
least a 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 °C throughout the
twenty-first century, the cumulative carbon emissions between 2011 and 2050 need 
to be limited to around 1,100 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2). However, the
greenhouse gas emissions contained in present estimates of global fossil fuel
reserves are around three times higher than this, and so the unabated use of all 
current fossil fuel reserves is incompatible with a warming limit of 2 °C. Here
we use a single integrated assessment model that contains estimates of the
quantities, locations and nature of the world's oil, gas and coal reserves and
resources, and which is shown to be consistent with a wide variety of modelling
approaches with different assumptions, to explore the implications of this
emissions limit for fossil fuel production in different regions. Our results
suggest that, globally, a third of oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80
per cent of current coal reserves should remain unused from 2010 to 2050 in order
to meet the target of 2 °C. We show that development of resources in the Arctic
and any increase in unconventional oil production are incommensurate with efforts
to limit average global warming to 2 °C. Our results show that policy makers'
instincts to exploit rapidly and completely their territorial fossil fuels are,
in aggregate, inconsistent with their commitments to this temperature limit.
Implementation of this policy commitment would also render unnecessary continued 
substantial expenditure on fossil fuel exploration, because any new discoveries
could not lead to increased aggregate production.

High-value alcohols and higher-oxidation-state compounds by catalytic Z-selective
cross-metathesis.

Olefin metathesis catalysts provide access to molecules that are indispensable to
physicians and researchers in the life sciences. A persisting problem, however,
is the dearth of chemical transformations that directly generate acyclic Z
allylic alcohols, including products that contain a hindered neighbouring
substituent or reactive functional units such as a phenol, an aldehyde, or a
carboxylic acid. Here we present an electronically modified ruthenium-disulfide
catalyst that is effective in generating such high-value compounds by
cross-metathesis. The ruthenium complex is prepared from a commercially available
precursor and an easily generated air-stable zinc catechothiolate.
Transformations typically proceed with 5.0 mole per cent of the complex and an
inexpensive reaction partner in 4-8 hours under ambient conditions; products are 
obtained in up to 80 per cent yield and 98:2 Z:E diastereoselectivity. The use of
this catalyst is demonstrated in the synthesis of the naturally occurring
anti-tumour agent neopeltolide and in a single-step stereoselective gram-scale
conversion of a renewable feedstock (oleic acid) to an anti-fungal agent. In this
conversion, the new catalyst promotes cross-metathesis more efficiently than the 
commonly used dichloro-ruthenium complexes, indicating that its utility may
extend beyond Z-selective processes.

Space-like separation of entangled quantum states is a central concept in
fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics and in quantum communication
applications. Optical approaches are ubiquitous in the distribution of
entanglement because entangled photons are easy to generate and transmit.
However, extending this direct distribution beyond a range of a few hundred
kilometres to a worldwide network is prohibited by losses associated with
scattering, diffraction and absorption during transmission. A proposal to
overcome this range limitation is the quantum repeater protocol, which involves
the distribution of entangled pairs of optical modes among many quantum memories 
stationed along the transmission channel. To be effective, the memories must
store the quantum information encoded on the optical modes for times that are
long compared to the direct optical transmission time of the channel. Here we
measure a decoherence rate of 8 × 10(-5) per second over 100 milliseconds, which 
is the time required for light transmission on a global scale. The measurements
were performed on a ground-state hyperfine transition of europium ion dopants in 
yttrium orthosilicate ((151)Eu(3+):Y2SiO5) using optically detected nuclear
magnetic resonance techniques. The observed decoherence rate is at least an order
of magnitude lower than that of any other system suitable for an optical quantum 
memory. Furthermore, by employing dynamic decoupling, a coherence time of
370 ± 60 minutes was achieved at 2 kelvin. It has been almost universally assumed
that light is the best long-distance carrier for quantum information. However,
the coherence time observed here is long enough that nuclear spins travelling at 
9 kilometres per hour in a crystal would have a lower decoherence with distance
than light in an optical fibre. This enables some very early approaches to
entanglement distribution to be revisited, in particular those in which the spins
are transported rather than the light.

Roughly half of the heavy elements (atomic mass greater than that of iron) are
believed to be synthesized in the late evolutionary stages of stars with masses
between 0.8 and 8 solar masses. Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly iron)
capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the slow-neutron-capture
process, or s-process) heavier elements that are subsequently brought to the
stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources, activated at distinct
temperatures, have been proposed: (13)C and (22)Ne, each releasing one neutron
per α-particle ((4)He) captured. To explain the measured stellar abundances,
stellar evolution models invoking the (13)C neutron source (which operates at
temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are favoured. Isotopic ratios
in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting nucleosynthesis in the previous
generations of stars that contributed material to the Solar System, point to
higher temperatures (more than three hundred million kelvin), requiring at least 
a late activation of (22)Ne (ref. 1). Here we report a determination of the
s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant stars, using zirconium
and niobium abundances, independently of stellar evolution models. The derived
temperature supports (13)C as the s-process neutron source. The radioactive pair 
(93)Zr-(93)Nb used to estimate the s-process temperature also provides, together 
with the pair (99)Tc-(99)Ru, chronometric information on the time elapsed since
the start of the s-process, which we determine to be one million to three million
years.

Intracellular pathogens are responsible for much of the world-wide morbidity and 
mortality due to infectious diseases. To colonize their hosts successfully,
pathogens must sense their environment and regulate virulence gene expression
appropriately. Accordingly, on entry into mammalian cells, the facultative
intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes remodels its
transcriptional program by activating the master virulence regulator PrfA. Here
we show that bacterial and host-derived glutathione are required to activate
PrfA. In this study a genetic selection led to the identification of a bacterial 
mutant in glutathione synthase that exhibited reduced virulence gene expression
and was attenuated 150-fold in mice. Genome sequencing of suppressor mutants that
arose spontaneously in vivo revealed a single nucleotide change in prfA that
locks the protein in the active conformation (PrfA*) and completely bypassed the 
requirement for glutathione during infection. Biochemical and genetic studies
support a model in which glutathione-dependent PrfA activation is mediated by
allosteric binding of glutathione to PrfA. Whereas glutathione and other
low-molecular-weight thiols have important roles in redox homeostasis in all
forms of life, here we demonstrate that glutathione represents a critical
signalling molecule that activates the virulence of an intracellular pathogen.

Yeasts, which have been a component of the human diet for at least 7,000 years,
possess an elaborate cell wall α-mannan. The influence of yeast mannan on the
ecology of the human microbiota is unknown. Here we show that yeast α-mannan is a
viable food source for the Gram-negative bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 
a dominant member of the microbiota. Detailed biochemical analysis and targeted
gene disruption studies support a model whereby limited cleavage of α-mannan on
the surface generates large oligosaccharides that are subsequently depolymerized 
to mannose by the action of periplasmic enzymes. Co-culturing studies showed that
metabolism of yeast mannan by B. thetaiotaomicron presents a 'selfish' model for 
the catabolism of this difficult to breakdown polysaccharide. Genomic comparison 
with B. thetaiotaomicron in conjunction with cell culture studies show that a
cohort of highly successful members of the microbiota has evolved to consume
sterically-restricted yeast glycans, an adaptation that may reflect the
incorporation of eukaryotic microorganisms into the human diet.

Crust at many divergent plate boundaries forms primarily by the injection of
vertical sheet-like dykes, some tens of kilometres long. Previous models of
rifting events indicate either lateral dyke growth away from a feeding source,
with propagation rates decreasing as the dyke lengthens, or magma flowing
vertically into dykes from an underlying source, with the role of topography on
the evolution of lateral dykes not clear. Here we show how a recent segmented
dyke intrusion in the Bárðarbunga volcanic system grew laterally for more than
45 kilometres at a variable rate, with topography influencing the direction of
propagation. Barriers at the ends of each segment were overcome by the build-up
of pressure in the dyke end; then a new segment formed and dyke lengthening
temporarily peaked. The dyke evolution, which occurred primarily over 14 days,
was revealed by propagating seismicity, ground deformation mapped by Global
Positioning System (GPS), interferometric analysis of satellite radar images
(InSAR), and graben formation. The strike of the dyke segments varies from an
initially radial direction away from the Bárðarbunga caldera, towards alignment
with that expected from regional stress at the distal end. A model minimizing the
combined strain and gravitational potential energy explains the propagation path.
Dyke opening and seismicity focused at the most distal segment at any given time,
and were simultaneous with magma source deflation and slow collapse at the
Bárðarbunga caldera, accompanied by a series of magnitude M > 5 earthquakes. Dyke
growth was slowed down by an effusive fissure eruption near the end of the dyke. 
Lateral dyke growth with segment barrier breaking by pressure build-up in the
dyke distal end explains how focused upwelling of magma under central volcanoes
is effectively redistributed over long distances to create new upper crust at
divergent plate boundaries.

Recent studies have shown that the diffusivity of enzymes increases in a
substrate-dependent manner during catalysis. Although this observation has been
reported and characterized for several different systems, the precise origin of
this phenomenon is unknown. Calorimetric methods are often used to determine
enthalpies from enzyme-catalysed reactions and can therefore provide important
insight into their reaction mechanisms. The ensemble averages involved in
traditional bulk calorimetry cannot probe the transient effects that the energy
exchanged in a reaction may have on the catalyst. Here we obtain single-molecule 
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data and analyse them within the framework 
of a stochastic theory to demonstrate a mechanistic link between the enhanced
diffusion of a single enzyme molecule and the heat released in the reaction. We
propose that the heat released during catalysis generates an asymmetric pressure 
wave that results in a differential stress at the protein-solvent interface that 
transiently displaces the centre-of-mass of the enzyme (chemoacoustic effect).
This novel perspective on how enzymes respond to the energy released during
catalysis suggests a possible effect of the heat of reaction on the structural
integrity and internal degrees of freedom of the enzyme.

Navigation requires a sense of direction ('compass'), which in mammals is thought
to be provided by head-direction cells, neurons that discharge when the animal's 
head points to a specific azimuth. However, it remains unclear whether a
three-dimensional (3D) compass exists in the brain. Here we conducted neural
recordings in bats, mammals well-adapted to 3D spatial behaviours, and found
head-direction cells tuned to azimuth, pitch or roll, or to conjunctive
combinations of 3D angles, in both crawling and flying bats. Head-direction cells
were organized along a functional-anatomical gradient in the presubiculum,
transitioning from 2D to 3D representations. In inverted bats, the azimuth-tuning
of neurons shifted by 180°, suggesting that 3D head direction is represented in
azimuth × pitch toroidal coordinates. Consistent with our toroidal model,
pitch-cell tuning was unimodal, circular, and continuous within the available
360° of pitch. Taken together, these results demonstrate a 3D head-direction
mechanism in mammals, which could support navigation in 3D space.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy is effective in debulking tumour masses initially;
however, in some patients tumours become progressively unresponsive after
multiple treatment cycles. Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer stem
cells (CSCs) are selectively enriched after chemotherapy through enhanced
survival. Here we reveal a new mechanism by which bladder CSCs actively
contribute to therapeutic resistance via an unexpected proliferative response to 
repopulate residual tumours between chemotherapy cycles, using human bladder
cancer xenografts. Further analyses demonstrate the recruitment of a quiescent
label-retaining pool of CSCs into cell division in response to
chemotherapy-induced damages, similar to mobilization of normal stem cells during
wound repair. While chemotherapy effectively induces apoptosis, associated
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release paradoxically promotes neighbouring CSC
repopulation. This repopulation can be abrogated by a PGE2-neutralizing antibody 
and celecoxib drug-mediated blockade of PGE2 signalling. In vivo administration
of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitor celecoxib effectively abolishes a PGE2- 
and COX2-mediated wound response gene signature, and attenuates progressive
manifestation of chemoresistance in xenograft tumours, including primary
xenografts derived from a patient who was resistant to chemotherapy.
Collectively, these findings uncover a new underlying mechanism that models the
progressive development of clinical chemoresistance, and implicate an adjunctive 
therapy to enhance chemotherapeutic response of bladder urothelial carcinomas by 
abrogating early tumour repopulation.

environment involves the emergence and disappearance of place fields in specific 
CA1 pyramidal neurons, and the acquisition of different spatial firing properties
across the active population. While such firing flexibility and diversity have
been linked to spatial memory, attention and task performance, the cellular and
network origin of these place cell features is unknown. Basic integrate-and-fire 
models of place firing propose that such features result solely from varying
inputs to place cells, but recent studies suggest instead that place cells
themselves may play an active role through regenerative dendritic events.
However, owing to the difficulty of performing functional recordings from place
cell dendrites, no direct evidence of regenerative dendritic events exists,
leaving any possible connection to place coding unknown. Using multi-plane
two-photon calcium imaging of CA1 place cell somata, axons and dendrites in mice 
navigating a virtual environment, here we show that regenerative dendritic events
do exist in place cells of behaving mice, and, surprisingly, their prevalence
throughout the arbour is highly spatiotemporally variable. Furthermore, we show
that the prevalence of such events predicts the spatial precision and persistence
or disappearance of place fields. This suggests that the dynamics of spiking
throughout the dendritic arbour may play a key role in forming the hippocampal
representation of space.

The gastrointestinal tracts of mammals are colonized by hundreds of microbial
species that contribute to health, including colonization resistance against
intestinal pathogens. Many antibiotics destroy intestinal microbial communities
and increase susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Among these, Clostridium
difficile, a major cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, greatly increases
morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Which intestinal bacteria
provide resistance to C. difficile infection and their in vivo inhibitory
mechanisms remain unclear. Here we correlate loss of specific bacterial taxa with
development of infection, by treating mice with different antibiotics that result
in distinct microbiota changes and lead to varied susceptibility to C. difficile.
Mathematical modelling augmented by analyses of the microbiota of hospitalized
patients identifies resistance-associated bacteria common to mice and humans.
Using these platforms, we determine that Clostridium scindens, a bile acid
7α-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium, is associated with resistance to C.
difficile infection and, upon administration, enhances resistance to infection in
a secondary bile acid dependent fashion. Using a workflow involving mouse models,
clinical studies, metagenomic analyses, and mathematical modelling, we identify a
probiotic candidate that corrects a clinically relevant microbiome deficiency.
These findings have implications for the rational design of targeted
antimicrobials as well as microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for
individuals at risk of C. difficile infection.

Protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) has a role in diverse cellular
processes such as DNA repair, transcription, Wnt signalling, and cell death.
Recent studies have shown that PARylation can serve as a signal for the
polyubiquitination and degradation of several crucial regulatory proteins,
including Axin and 3BP2 (refs 7, 8, 9). The RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 
(also known as Iduna) is responsible for PARylation-dependent ubiquitination
(PARdU). Here we provide a structural basis for RNF146-catalysed PARdU and how
PARdU specificity is achieved. First, we show that iso-ADP-ribose (iso-ADPr), the
smallest internal poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) structural unit, binds between the WWE
and RING domains of RNF146 and functions as an allosteric signal that switches
the RING domain from a catalytically inactive state to an active one. In the
absence of PAR, the RING domain is unable to bind and activate a
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) efficiently. Binding of PAR or iso-ADPr induces
a major conformational change that creates a functional RING structure. Thus,
RNF146 represents a new mechanistic class of RING E3 ligases, the activities of
which are regulated by non-covalent ligand binding, and that may provide a
template for designing inducible protein-degradation systems. Second, we find
that RNF146 directly interacts with the PAR polymerase tankyrase (TNKS).
Disruption of the RNF146-TNKS interaction inhibits turnover of the substrate Axin
in cells. Thus, both substrate PARylation and PARdU are catalysed by enzymes
within the same protein complex, and PARdU substrate specificity may be primarily
determined by the substrate-TNKS interaction. We propose that the maintenance of 
unliganded RNF146 in an inactive state may serve to maintain the stability of the
RNF146-TNKS complex, which in turn regulates the homeostasis of PARdU activity in
the cell.

Reproduction in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) involves either external or
internal fertilization. It is commonly argued that internal fertilization can
evolve from external, but not the reverse. Male copulatory claspers are present
in certain placoderms, fossil jawed vertebrates retrieved as a paraphyletic
segment of the gnathostome stem group in recent studies. This suggests that
internal fertilization could be primitive for gnathostomes, but such a conclusion
depends on demonstrating that copulation was not just a specialized feature of
certain placoderm subgroups. The reproductive biology of antiarchs, consistently 
identified as the least crownward placoderms and thus of great interest in this
context, has until now remained unknown. Here we show that certain antiarchs
possessed dermal claspers in the males, while females bore paired dermal plates
inferred to have facilitated copulation. These structures are not associated with
pelvic fins. The clasper morphology resembles that of ptyctodonts, a more
crownward placoderm group, suggesting that all placoderm claspers are homologous 
and that internal fertilization characterized all placoderms. This implies that
external fertilization and spawning, which characterize most extant aquatic
gnathostomes, must be derived from internal fertilization, even though this
transformation has been thought implausible. Alternatively, the substantial
morphological evidence for placoderm paraphyly must be rejected.

The germinal centre (GC) reaction supports affinity-based B-cell competition and 
generates high-affinity bone-marrow plasma cells (BMPCs). How follicular T-helper
(TFH) cells regulate GC selection is not clear. Using competitive mixed chimaera,
we show here that, beyond the role in promoting TFH development, ICOSL (inducible
T-cell co-stimulator ligand, also known as ICOSLG) is important for individual B 
cells to competitively participate in the GC reaction and to develop into BMPCs. 
Using intravital imaging aided by a calcium reporter, we further show that ICOSL 
promotes an 'entangled' mode of TFH-B-cell interactions, characterized by brief
but extensive surface engagement, productive T-cell calcium spikes, and B-cell
acquisition of CD40 signals. Reiterated entanglement promotes outer-zone
co-localization of outcompeting GC B cells together with TFH cells, affording the
former increased access to T-cell help. ICOSL on GC B cells is upregulated by
CD40 signals. Such an intercellular positive feedback between contact-dependent
help and ICOSL-controlled entanglement promotes positive selection and BMPC
development, as evidenced by observations that higher-affinity B-cell receptor
variants are enriched in the ICOSL(high) fraction, that numerically disadvantaged
ICOSL-deficient GC B cells or BMPCs exhibit strong affinity compensation in
competitive chimaera, and that when GC competition proceeds without ICOSL,
selection of high-affinity variants in otherwise normal GC reactions is impaired.
By demonstrating entanglement as the basic form of GC TFH-B-cell interactions,
identifying ICOSL as a molecular linkage between T-B interactional dynamics and
positive selection for high-affinity BMPC formation, our study reveals a pathway 
by which TFH cells control the quality of long-lived humoral immunity.

Machine technology frequently puts magnetic or electrostatic repulsive forces to 
practical use, as in maglev trains, vehicle suspensions or non-contact bearings. 
In contrast, materials design overwhelmingly focuses on attractive interactions, 
such as in the many advanced polymer-based composites, where inorganic fillers
interact with a polymer matrix to improve mechanical properties. However,
articular cartilage strikingly illustrates how electrostatic repulsion can be
harnessed to achieve unparalleled functional efficiency: it permits virtually
frictionless mechanical motion within joints, even under high compression. Here
we describe a composite hydrogel with anisotropic mechanical properties dominated
by electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged unilamellar titanate
nanosheets embedded within it. Crucial to the behaviour of this hydrogel is the
serendipitous discovery of cofacial nanosheet alignment in aqueous colloidal
dispersions subjected to a strong magnetic field, which maximizes electrostatic
repulsion and thereby induces a quasi-crystalline structural ordering over
macroscopic length scales and with uniformly large face-to-face nanosheet
separation. We fix this transiently induced structural order by transforming the 
dispersion into a hydrogel using light-triggered in situ vinyl polymerization.
The resultant hydrogel, containing charged inorganic structures that align
cofacially in a magnetic flux, deforms easily under shear forces applied parallel
to the embedded nanosheets yet resists compressive forces applied orthogonally.
We anticipate that the concept of embedding anisotropic repulsive electrostatics 
within a composite material, inspired by articular cartilage, will open up new
possibilities for developing soft materials with unusual functions.

In transport experiments, the quantum nature of matter becomes directly evident
when changes in conductance occur only in discrete steps, with a size determined 
solely by Planck's constant h. Observations of quantized steps in electrical
conductance have provided important insights into the physics of mesoscopic
systems and have allowed the development of quantum electronic devices. Even
though quantized conductance should not rely on the presence of electric charges,
it has never been observed for neutral, massive particles. In its most
fundamental form, it requires a quantum-degenerate Fermi gas, a ballistic and
adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with dimensions comparable to the
Fermi wavelength. Here we report the observation of quantized conductance in the 
transport of neutral atoms driven by a chemical potential bias. The atoms are in 
an ultraballistic regime, where their mean free path exceeds not only the size of
the transport channel, but also the size of the entire system, including the atom
reservoirs. We use high-resolution lithography to shape light potentials that
realize either a quantum point contact or a quantum wire for atoms. These
constrictions are imprinted on a quasi-two-dimensional ballistic channel
connecting the reservoirs. By varying either a gate potential or the transverse
confinement of the constrictions, we observe distinct plateaux in the atom
conductance. The conductance in the first plateau is found to be equal to the
universal conductance quantum, 1/h. We use Landauer's formula to model our
results and find good agreement for low gate potentials, with all parameters
determined a priori. Our experiment lets us investigate quantum conductors with
wide control not only over the channel geometry, but also over the reservoir
properties, such as interaction strength, size and thermalization rate.

Nearly a century ago it was recognized that radiation absorption by stellar
matter controls the internal temperature profiles within stars. Laboratory
opacity measurements, however, have never been performed at stellar interior
conditions, introducing uncertainties in stellar models. A particular problem
arose when refined photosphere spectral analysis led to reductions of 30-50 per
cent in the inferred amounts of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the Sun. Standard 
solar models using the revised element abundances disagree with helioseismic
observations that determine the internal solar structure using acoustic
oscillations. This could be resolved if the true mean opacity for the solar
interior matter were roughly 15 per cent higher than predicted, because increased
opacity compensates for the decreased element abundances. Iron accounts for a
quarter of the total opacity at the solar radiation/convection zone boundary.
Here we report measurements of wavelength-resolved iron opacity at electron
temperatures of 1.9-2.3 million kelvin and electron densities of
(0.7-4.0) × 10(22) per cubic centimetre, conditions very similar to those in the 
solar region that affects the discrepancy the most: the radiation/convection zone
boundary. The measured wavelength-dependent opacity is 30-400 per cent higher
than predicted. This represents roughly half the change in the mean opacity
needed to resolve the solar discrepancy, even though iron is only one of many
elements that contribute to opacity.

The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are high-conductance intracellular Ca(2+) channels
that play a pivotal role in the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal and
cardiac muscles. RyRs are the largest known ion channels, with a homotetrameric
organization and approximately 5,000 residues in each protomer. Here we report
the structure of the rabbit RyR1 in complex with its modulator FKBP12 at an
overall resolution of 3.8 Å, determined by single-particle electron
cryomicroscopy. Three previously uncharacterized domains, named central, handle
and helical domains, display the armadillo repeat fold. These domains, together
with the amino-terminal domain, constitute a network of superhelical scaffold for
binding and propagation of conformational changes. The channel domain exhibits
the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily fold with distinct features. A
negative-charge-enriched hairpin loop connecting S5 and the pore helix is
positioned above the entrance to the selectivity-filter vestibule. The four
elongated S6 segments form a right-handed helical bundle that closes the pore at 
the cytoplasmic border of the membrane. Allosteric regulation of the pore by the 
cytoplasmic domains is mediated through extensive interactions between the
central domains and the channel domain. These structural features explain high
ion conductance by RyRs and the long-range allosteric regulation of channel
activities.

Extreme, abrupt Northern Hemisphere climate oscillations during the last glacial 
cycle (140,000 years ago to present) were modulated by changes in ocean
circulation and atmospheric forcing. However, the variability of the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), which has a role in controlling heat
transport from low to high latitudes and in ocean CO2 storage, is still poorly
constrained beyond the Last Glacial Maximum. Here we show that a deep and
vigorous overturning circulation mode has persisted for most of the last glacial 
cycle, dominating ocean circulation in the Atlantic, whereas a shallower glacial 
mode with southern-sourced waters filling the deep western North Atlantic
prevailed during glacial maxima. Our results are based on a reconstruction of
both the strength and the direction of the AMOC during the last glacial cycle
from a highly resolved marine sedimentary record in the deep western North
Atlantic. Parallel measurements of two independent chemical water tracers (the
isotope ratios of (231)Pa/(230)Th and (143)Nd/(144)Nd), which are not directly
affected by changes in the global cycle, reveal consistent responses of the AMOC 
during the last two glacial terminations. Any significant deviations from this
configuration, resulting in slowdowns of the AMOC, were restricted to
centennial-scale excursions during catastrophic iceberg discharges of the
Heinrich stadials. Severe and multicentennial weakening of North Atlantic Deep
Water formation occurred only during Heinrich stadials close to glacial maxima
with increased ice coverage, probably as a result of increased fresh-water input.
In contrast, the AMOC was relatively insensitive to submillennial meltwater
pulses during warmer climate states, and an active AMOC prevailed during
Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials (Greenland warm periods).

Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, exhibits extensive aeolian, that is,
wind-formed, dunes, features previously identified exclusively on Earth, Mars and
Venus. Wind tunnel data collected under ambient and planetary-analogue conditions
inform our models of aeolian processes on the terrestrial planets. However, the
accuracy of these widely used formulations in predicting the threshold wind
speeds required to move sand by saltation, or by short bounces, has not been
tested under conditions relevant for non-terrestrial planets. Here we derive
saltation threshold wind speeds under the thick-atmosphere, low-gravity and
low-sediment-density conditions on Titan, using a high-pressure wind tunnel
refurbished to simulate the appropriate kinematic viscosity for the near-surface 
atmosphere of Titan. The experimentally derived saltation threshold wind speeds
are higher than those predicted by models based on terrestrial-analogue
experiments, indicating the limitations of these models for such extreme
conditions. The models can be reconciled with the experimental results by
inclusion of the extremely low ratio of particle density to fluid density on
Titan. Whereas the density ratio term enables accurate modelling of aeolian
entrainment in thick atmospheres, such as those inferred for some extrasolar
planets, our results also indicate that for environments with high density
ratios, such as in jets on icy satellites or in tenuous atmospheres or
exospheres, the correction for low-density-ratio conditions is not required.

The widespread reorganization of cellular architecture in mitosis is achieved
through extensive protein phosphorylation, driven by the coordinated activation
of a mitotic kinase network and repression of counteracting phosphatases.
Phosphatase activity must subsequently be restored to promote mitotic exit.
Although Cdc14 phosphatase drives this reversal in budding yeast, protein
phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities have each been
independently linked to mitotic exit control in other eukaryotes. Here we
describe a mitotic phosphatase relay in which PP1 reactivation is required for
the reactivation of both PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 to coordinate mitotic progression 
and exit in fission yeast. The staged recruitment of PP1 (the Dis2 isoform) to
the regulatory subunits of the PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 (B55 also known as Pab1; B56
also known as Par1) holoenzymes sequentially activates each phosphatase. The
pathway is blocked in early mitosis because the Cdk1-cyclin B kinase (Cdk1 also
known as Cdc2) inhibits PP1 activity, but declining cyclin B levels later in
mitosis permit PP1 to auto-reactivate. PP1 first reactivates PP2A-B55; this
enables PP2A-B55 in turn to promote the reactivation of PP2A-B56 by
dephosphorylating a PP1-docking site in PP2A-B56, thereby promoting the
recruitment of PP1. PP1 recruitment to human, mitotic PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and
the sequences of these conserved PP1-docking motifs suggest that PP1 regulates
PP2A-B55 and PP2A-B56 activities in a variety of signalling contexts throughout
eukaryotes.

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) mediate the rapid release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from
intracellular stores into the cytosol, which is essential for numerous cellular
functions including excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. Lack of sufficient
structural detail has impeded understanding of RyR gating and regulation. Here we
report the closed-state structure of the 2.3-megadalton complex of the rabbit
skeletal muscle type 1 RyR (RyR1), solved by single-particle electron
cryomicroscopy at an overall resolution of 4.8 Å. We fitted a polyalanine-level
model to all 3,757 ordered residues in each protomer, defining the transmembrane 
pore in unprecedented detail and placing all cytosolic domains as tertiary folds.
The cytosolic assembly is built on an extended α-solenoid scaffold connecting key
regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture places it in the
six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the
second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands 
originating from the α-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel
gating by Ca(2+).

Muscle contraction is initiated by the release of calcium (Ca(2+)) from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of myocytes through ryanodine receptors
(RyRs). RyRs are homotetrameric channels with a molecular mass of more than
2.2 megadaltons that are regulated by several factors, including ions, small
molecules and proteins. Numerous mutations in RyRs have been associated with
human diseases. The molecular mechanism underlying the complex regulation of RyRs
is poorly understood. Using electron cryomicroscopy, here we determine the
architecture of rabbit RyR1 at a resolution of 6.1 Å. We show that the
cytoplasmic moiety of RyR1 contains two large α-solenoid domains and several
smaller domains, with folds suggestive of participation in protein-protein
interactions. The transmembrane domain represents a chimaera of voltage-gated
sodium and pH-activated ion channels. We identify the calcium-binding EF-hand
domain and show that it functions as a conformational switch allosterically
gating the channel.

Photosynthesis converts light energy into biologically useful chemical energy
vital to life on Earth. The initial reaction of photosynthesis takes place in
photosystem II (PSII), a 700-kilodalton homodimeric membrane protein complex that
catalyses photo-oxidation of water into dioxygen through an S-state cycle of the 
oxygen evolving complex (OEC). The structure of PSII has been solved by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) at 1.9 ångström resolution, which revealed that the OEC is a
Mn4CaO5-cluster coordinated by a well defined protein environment. However,
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies showed that the
manganese cations in the OEC are easily reduced by X-ray irradiation, and slight 
differences were found in the Mn-Mn distances determined by XRD, EXAFS and
theoretical studies. Here we report a 'radiation-damage-free' structure of PSII
from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus in the S1 state at a resolution of 1.95
ångströms using femtosecond X-ray pulses of the SPring-8 ångström compact
free-electron laser (SACLA) and hundreds of large, highly isomorphous PSII
crystals. Compared with the structure from XRD, the OEC in the X-ray free
electron laser structure has Mn-Mn distances that are shorter by 0.1-0.2
ångströms. The valences of each manganese atom were tentatively assigned as
Mn1D(III), Mn2C(IV), Mn3B(IV) and Mn4A(III), based on the average Mn-ligand
distances and analysis of the Jahn-Teller axis on Mn(III). One of the oxo-bridged
oxygens, O5, has significantly longer distances to Mn than do the other
oxo-oxygen atoms, suggesting that O5 is a hydroxide ion instead of a normal
oxygen dianion and therefore may serve as one of the substrate oxygen atoms.
These findings provide a structural basis for the mechanism of oxygen evolution, 
and we expect that this structure will provide a blueprint for the design of
artificial catalysts for water oxidation.

Emerging evidence suggests that the ribosome has a regulatory function in
directing how the genome is translated in time and space. However, how this
regulation is encoded in the messenger RNA sequence remains largely unknown. Here
we uncover unique RNA regulons embedded in homeobox (Hox) 5' untranslated regions
(UTRs) that confer ribosome-mediated control of gene expression. These structured
RNA elements, resembling viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), are found
in subsets of Hox mRNAs. They facilitate ribosome recruitment and require the
ribosomal protein RPL38 for their activity. Despite numerous layers of Hox gene
regulation, these IRES elements are essential for converting Hox transcripts into
proteins to pattern the mammalian body plan. This specialized mode of
IRES-dependent translation is enabled by an additional regulatory element that we
term the translation inhibitory element (TIE), which blocks cap-dependent
translation of transcripts. Together, these data uncover a new paradigm for
ribosome-mediated control of gene expression and organismal development.

The mammary gland is composed of multiple types of epithelial cells, which are
generated by mammary stem cells (MaSCs) residing at the top of the hierarchy.
However, the existence of these multipotent MaSCs remains controversial and the
nature of such cells is unknown. Here we demonstrate that protein C receptor
(Procr), a novel Wnt target in the mammary gland, marks a unique population of
multipotent mouse MaSCs. Procr-positive cells localize to the basal layer,
exhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition characteristics, and express low
levels of basal keratins. Procr-expressing cells have a high regenerative
capacity in transplantation assays and differentiate into all lineages of the
mammary epithelium by lineage tracing. These results define a novel multipotent
mammary stem cell population that could be important in the initiation of breast 
cancer.

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) remains enigmatic, despite 1.4 million cases worldwide
annually. It differs radically from other picornaviruses, existing in an
enveloped form and being unusually stable, both genetically and physically, but
has proved difficult to study. Here we report high-resolution X-ray structures
for the mature virus and the empty particle. The structures of the two particles 
are indistinguishable, apart from some disorder on the inside of the empty
particle. The full virus contains the small viral protein VP4, whereas the empty 
particle harbours only the uncleaved precursor, VP0. The smooth particle surface 
is devoid of depressions that might correspond to receptor-binding sites. Peptide
scanning data extend the previously reported VP3 antigenic site, while
structure-based predictions suggest further epitopes. HAV contains no pocket
factor and can withstand remarkably high temperature and low pH, and empty
particles are even more robust than full particles. The virus probably uncoats
via a novel mechanism, being assembled differently to other picornaviruses. It
utilizes a VP2 'domain swap' characteristic of insect picorna-like viruses, and
structure-based phylogenetic analysis places HAV between typical picornaviruses
and the insect viruses. The enigmatic properties of HAV may reflect its position 
as a link between 'modern' picornaviruses and the more 'primitive' precursor
insect viruses; for instance, HAV retains the ability to move from cell-to-cell
by transcytosis.

The mechanisms that underlie the origin of major prokaryotic groups are poorly
understood. In principle, the origin of both species and higher taxa among
prokaryotes should entail similar mechanisms--ecological interactions with the
environment paired with natural genetic variation involving lineage-specific gene
innovations and lineage-specific gene acquisitions. To investigate the origin of 
higher taxa in archaea, we have determined gene distributions and gene
phylogenies for the 267,568 protein-coding genes of 134 sequenced archaeal
genomes in the context of their homologues from 1,847 reference bacterial
genomes. Archaeal-specific gene families define 13 traditionally recognized
archaeal higher taxa in our sample. Here we report that the origins of these 13
groups unexpectedly correspond to 2,264 group-specific gene acquisitions from
bacteria. Interdomain gene transfer is highly asymmetric, transfers from bacteria
to archaea are more than fivefold more frequent than vice versa. Gene transfers
identified at major evolutionary transitions among prokaryotes specifically
implicate gene acquisitions for metabolic functions from bacteria as key
innovations in the origin of higher archaeal taxa.

Intracellular ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-α/β-inducible ubiquitin-like modifier 
which can covalently bind other proteins in a process called ISGylation; it is an
effector of IFN-α/β-dependent antiviral immunity in mice. We previously published
a study describing humans with inherited ISG15 deficiency but without unusually
severe viral diseases. We showed that these patients were prone to mycobacterial 
disease and that human ISG15 was non-redundant as an extracellular IFN-γ-inducing
molecule. We show here that ISG15-deficient patients also display unanticipated
cellular, immunological and clinical signs of enhanced IFN-α/β immunity,
reminiscent of the Mendelian autoinflammatory interferonopathies
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and spondyloenchondrodysplasia. We further show that
an absence of intracellular ISG15 in the patients' cells prevents the
accumulation of USP18, a potent negative regulator of IFN-α/β signalling,
resulting in the enhancement and amplification of IFN-α/β responses. Human ISG15,
therefore, is not only redundant for antiviral immunity, but is a key negative
regulator of IFN-α/β immunity. In humans, intracellular ISG15 is
IFN-α/β-inducible not to serve as a substrate for ISGylation-dependent antiviral 
immunity, but to ensure USP18-dependent regulation of IFN-α/β and prevention of
IFN-α/β-dependent autoinflammation.

Sterols are essential biological molecules in the majority of life forms. Sterol 
reductases including Δ(14)-sterol reductase (C14SR, also known as TM7SF2),
7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) and 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase
(DHCR24) reduce specific carbon-carbon double bonds of the sterol moiety using a 
reducing cofactor during sterol biosynthesis. Lamin B receptor (LBR), an integral
inner nuclear membrane protein, also contains a functional C14SR domain. Here we 
report the crystal structure of a Δ(14)-sterol reductase (MaSR1) from the
methanotrophic bacterium Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z (a homologue of human 
C14SR, LBR and DHCR7) with the cofactor NADPH. The enzyme contains ten
transmembrane segments (TM1-10). Its catalytic domain comprises the
carboxy-terminal half (containing TM6-10) and envelops two interconnected
pockets, one of which faces the cytoplasm and houses NADPH, while the other one
is accessible from the lipid bilayer. Comparison with a soluble steroid
5β-reductase structure suggests that the reducing end of NADPH meets the sterol
substrate at the juncture of the two pockets. A sterol reductase activity assay
proves that MaSR1 can reduce the double bond of a cholesterol biosynthetic
intermediate, demonstrating functional conservation to human C14SR. Therefore,
our structure as a prototype of integral membrane sterol reductases provides
molecular insight into mutations in DHCR7 and LBR for inborn human diseases.
