Peptidoglycan (PG), an essential structure in the cell walls of the vast majority
of bacteria, is critical for division and maintaining cell shape and hydrostatic 
pressure. Bacteria comprising the Chlamydiales were thought to be one of the few 
exceptions. Chlamydia harbour genes for PG biosynthesis and exhibit
susceptibility to 'anti-PG' antibiotics, yet attempts to detect PG in any
chlamydial species have proven unsuccessful (the 'chlamydial anomaly'). We used a
novel approach to metabolically label chlamydial PG using d-amino acid dipeptide 
probes and click chemistry. Replicating Chlamydia trachomatis were labelled with 
these probes throughout their biphasic developmental life cycle, and the results 
of differential probe incorporation experiments conducted in the presence of
ampicillin are consistent with the presence of chlamydial PG-modifying enzymes.
These findings culminate 50 years of speculation and debate concerning the
chlamydial anomaly and are the strongest evidence so far that chlamydial species 
possess functional PG.

Cervical cancer is responsible for 10-15% of cancer-related deaths in women
worldwide. The aetiological role of infection with high-risk human papilloma
viruses (HPVs) in cervical carcinomas is well established. Previous studies have 
also implicated somatic mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, STK11 and KRAS as well
as several copy-number alterations in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinomas.
Here we report whole-exome sequencing analysis of 115 cervical carcinoma-normal
paired samples, transcriptome sequencing of 79 cases and whole-genome sequencing 
of 14 tumour-normal pairs. Previously unknown somatic mutations in 79 primary
squamous cell carcinomas include recurrent E322K substitutions in the MAPK1 gene 
(8%), inactivating mutations in the HLA-B gene (9%), and mutations in EP300
(16%), FBXW7 (15%), NFE2L2 (4%), TP53 (5%) and ERBB2 (6%). We also observe
somatic ELF3 (13%) and CBFB (8%) mutations in 24 adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell
carcinomas have higher frequencies of somatic nucleotide substitutions occurring 
at cytosines preceded by thymines (Tp*C sites) than adenocarcinomas. Gene
expression levels at HPV integration sites were statistically significantly
higher in tumours with HPV integration compared with expression of the same genes
in tumours without viral integration at the same site. These data demonstrate
several recurrent genomic alterations in cervical carcinomas that suggest new
strategies to combat this disease.

Cytosine residues in mammalian DNA occur in five forms: cytosine (C),
5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC)
and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases
convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC in three consecutive, Fe(II)- and
α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxidation reactions. The Tet family of dioxygenases is 
widely distributed across the tree of life, including in the heterolobosean
amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi. The genome of Naegleria encodes homologues of
mammalian DNA methyltransferase and Tet proteins. Here we study biochemically and
structurally one of the Naegleria Tet-like proteins (NgTet1), which shares
significant sequence conservation (approximately 14% identity or 39% similarity) 
with mammalian Tet1. Like mammalian Tet proteins, NgTet1 acts on 5mC and
generates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. The crystal structure of NgTet1 in complex with DNA
containing a 5mCpG site revealed that NgTet1 uses a base-flipping mechanism to
access 5mC. The DNA is contacted from the minor groove and bent towards the major
groove. The flipped 5mC is positioned in the active-site pocket with planar
stacking contacts, Watson-Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals
interactions specific for 5mC. The sequence conservation between NgTet1 and
mammalian Tet1, including residues involved in structural integrity and
functional significance, suggests structural conservation across phyla.

Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors have shown early promise in
clinical trials. The therapeutic transgene cassette can be packaged in different 
AAV capsid pseudotypes, each having a unique transduction profile. At present,
rAAV capsid serotype selection for a specific clinical trial is based on
effectiveness in animal models. However, preclinical animal studies are not
always predictive of human outcome. Here, in an attempt to further our
understanding of these discrepancies, we used a chimaeric human-murine liver
model to compare directly the relative efficiency of rAAV transduction in human
versus mouse hepatocytes in vivo. As predicted from preclinical and clinical
studies, rAAV2 vectors functionally transduced mouse and human hepatocytes at
equivalent but relatively low levels. However, rAAV8 vectors, which are very
effective in many animal models, transduced human hepatocytes rather
poorly-approximately 20 times less efficiently than mouse hepatocytes. In light
of the limitations of the rAAV vectors currently used in clinical studies, we
used the same murine chimaeric liver model to perform serial selection using a
human-specific replication-competent viral library composed of DNA-shuffled AAV
capsids. One chimaeric capsid composed of five different parental AAV capsids was
found to transduce human primary hepatocytes at high efficiency in vitro and in
vivo, and provided species-selected transduction in primary liver, cultured cells
and a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model. This vector is an ideal clinical 
candidate and a reagent for gene modification of human xenotransplants in mouse
models of human diseases. More importantly, our results suggest that humanized
murine models may represent a more precise approach for both selecting and
evaluating clinically relevant rAAV serotypes for gene therapeutic applications.

A major challenge in human genetics is to devise a systematic strategy to
integrate disease-associated variants with diverse genomic and biological data
sets to provide insight into disease pathogenesis and guide drug discovery for
complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here we performed a genome-wide
association study meta-analysis in a total of >100,000 subjects of European and
Asian ancestries (29,880 RA cases and 73,758 controls), by evaluating ∼10 million
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We discovered 42 novel RA risk loci at a
genome-wide level of significance, bringing the total to 101 (refs 2 - 4). We
devised an in silico pipeline using established bioinformatics methods based on
functional annotation, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci and pathway 
analyses--as well as novel methods based on genetic overlap with human primary
immunodeficiency, haematological cancer somatic mutations and knockout mouse
phenotypes--to identify 98 biological candidate genes at these 101 risk loci. We 
demonstrate that these genes are the targets of approved therapies for RA, and
further suggest that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for
the treatment of RA. Together, this comprehensive genetic study sheds light on
fundamental genes, pathways and cell types that contribute to RA pathogenesis,
and provides empirical evidence that the genetics of RA can provide important
information for drug discovery.

Interactions between species can promote evolutionary divergence of ecological
traits and social signals, a process widely assumed to generate species
differences in adaptive radiation. However, an alternative view is that lineages 
typically interact when relatively old, by which time selection for divergence is
weak and potentially exceeded by convergent selection acting on traits mediating 
interspecific competition. Few studies have tested these contrasting predictions 
across large radiations, or by controlling for evolutionary time. Thus the role
of species interactions in driving broad-scale patterns of trait divergence is
unclear. Here we use phylogenetic estimates of divergence times to show that
increased trait differences among coexisting lineages of ovenbirds (Furnariidae) 
are explained by their greater evolutionary age in relation to non-interacting
lineages, and that--when these temporal biases are accounted for--the only
significant effect of coexistence is convergence in a social signal (song). Our
results conflict with the conventional view that coexistence promotes trait
divergence among co-occurring organisms at macroevolutionary scales, and instead 
provide evidence that species interactions can drive phenotypic convergence
across entire radiations, a pattern generally concealed by biases in age.

The unidirectional airflow patterns in the lungs of birds have long been
considered a unique and specialized trait associated with the oxygen demands of
flying, their endothermic metabolism and unusual pulmonary architecture. However,
the discovery of similar flow patterns in the lungs of crocodilians indicates
that this character is probably ancestral for all archosaurs--the group that
includes extant birds and crocodilians as well as their extinct relatives, such
as pterosaurs and dinosaurs. Unidirectional flow in birds results from
aerodynamic valves, rather than from sphincters or other physical mechanisms, and
similar aerodynamic valves seem to be present in crocodilians. The anatomical and
developmental similarities in the primary and secondary bronchi of birds and
crocodilians suggest that these structures and airflow patterns may be
homologous. The origin of this pattern is at least as old as the split between
crocodilians and birds, which occurred in the Triassic period. Alternatively,
this pattern of flow may be even older; this hypothesis can be tested by
investigating patterns of airflow in members of the outgroup to birds and
crocodilians, the Lepidosauromorpha (tuatara, lizards and snakes). Here we
demonstrate region-specific unidirectional airflow in the lungs of the savannah
monitor lizard (Varanus exanthematicus). The presence of unidirectional flow in
the lungs of V. exanthematicus thus gives rise to two possible evolutionary
scenarios: either unidirectional airflow evolved independently in archosaurs and 
monitor lizards, or these flow patterns are homologous in archosaurs and
V. exanthematicus, having evolved only once in ancestral diapsids (the clade
encompassing snakes, lizards, crocodilians and birds). If unidirectional airflow 
is plesiomorphic for Diapsida, this respiratory character can be reconstructed
for extinct diapsids, and evolved in a small ectothermic tetrapod during the
Palaeozoic era at least a hundred million years before the origin of birds.

There are no clinically relevant treatments available that improve function in
the growing population of very preterm infants (less than 32 weeks' gestation)
with neonatal brain injury. Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI) is a common
finding in these children and results in chronic neurodevelopmental impairments. 
As shown recently, failure in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation
contributes to DWMI. We demonstrated previously that the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) has an important role in oligodendrocyte development. Here we
examine whether enhanced EGFR signalling stimulates the endogenous response of
EGFR-expressing progenitor cells during a critical period after brain injury, and
promotes cellular and behavioural recovery in the developing brain. Using an
established mouse model of very preterm brain injury, we demonstrate that
selective overexpression of human EGFR in oligodendrocyte lineage cells or the
administration of intranasal heparin-binding EGF immediately after injury
decreases oligodendroglia death, enhances generation of new oligodendrocytes from
progenitor cells and promotes functional recovery. Furthermore, these
interventions diminish ultrastructural abnormalities and alleviate behavioural
deficits on white-matter-specific paradigms. Inhibition of EGFR signalling with a
molecularly targeted agent used for cancer therapy demonstrates that EGFR
activation is an important contributor to oligodendrocyte regeneration and
functional recovery after DWMI. Thus, our study provides direct evidence that
targeting EGFR in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at a specific time after
injury is clinically feasible and potentially applicable to the treatment of
premature children with white matter injury.

DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination has evolved to
maintain genetic integrity in all organisms. Although many reactions that occur
during homologous recombination are known, it is unclear where, when and how they
occur in cells. Here, by using conventional and super-resolution microscopy, we
describe the progression of DSB repair in live Escherichia coli. Specifically, we
investigate whether homologous recombination can occur efficiently between
distant sister loci that have segregated to opposite halves of an E. coli cell.
We show that a site-specific DSB in one sister can be repaired efficiently using 
distant sister homology. After RecBCD processing of the DSB, RecA is recruited to
the cut locus, where it nucleates into a bundle that contains many more RecA
molecules than can associate with the two single-stranded DNA regions that form
at the DSB. Mature bundles extend along the long axis of the cell, in the space
between the bulk nucleoid and the inner membrane. Bundle formation is followed by
pairing, in which the two ends of the cut locus relocate at the periphery of the 
nucleoid and together move rapidly towards the homology of the uncut sister.
After sister locus pairing, RecA bundles disassemble and proteins that act late
in homologous recombination are recruited to give viable recombinants
1-2-generation-time equivalents after formation of the initial DSB. Mutated RecA 
proteins that do not form bundles are defective in sister pairing and in
DSB-induced repair. This work reveals an unanticipated role of RecA bundles in
channelling the movement of the DNA DSB ends, thereby facilitating the long-range
homology search that occurs before the strand invasion and transfer reactions.

Currently, there is little evidence for a notable role of the vertebrate microRNA
(miRNA) system in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses. This is primarily attributed
to the ease with which these viruses mutate to disrupt recognition and growth
suppression by host miRNAs. Here we report that the haematopoietic-cell-specific 
miRNA miR-142-3p potently restricts the replication of the mosquito-borne North
American eastern equine encephalitis virus in myeloid-lineage cells by binding to
sites in the 3' non-translated region of its RNA genome. However, by limiting
myeloid cell tropism and consequent innate immunity induction, this restriction
directly promotes neurologic disease manifestations characteristic of eastern
equine encephalitis virus infection in humans. Furthermore, the region containing
the miR-142-3p binding sites is essential for efficient virus infection of
mosquito vectors. We propose that RNA viruses can adapt to use antiviral
properties of vertebrate miRNAs to limit replication in particular cell types and
that this restriction can lead to exacerbation of disease severity.

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) induces transdifferentiation of B cells
into macrophages at high efficiencies and enhances reprogramming into induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells when co-expressed with the transcription factors
Oct4 (Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (hereafter called OSKM). However, how C/EBPα
accomplishes these effects is unclear. Here we find that in mouse primary B cells
transient C/EBPα expression followed by OSKM activation induces a 100-fold
increase in iPS cell reprogramming efficiency, involving 95% of the population.
During this conversion, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes 
become markedly upregulated, and 60% of the cells express Oct4 within 2 days.
C/EBPα acts as a 'path-breaker' as it transiently makes the chromatin of
pluripotency genes more accessible to DNase I. C/EBPα also induces the expression
of the dioxygenase Tet2 and promotes its translocation to the nucleus where it
binds to regulatory regions of pluripotency genes that become demethylated after 
OSKM induction. In line with these findings, overexpression of Tet2 enhances
OSKM-induced B-cell reprogramming. Because the enzyme is also required for
efficient C/EBPα-induced immune cell conversion, our data indicate that Tet2
provides a mechanistic link between iPS cell reprogramming and B-cell
transdifferentiation. The rapid iPS reprogramming approach described here should 
help to fully elucidate the process and has potential clinical applications.

Performing genetic studies in multiple human populations can identify disease
risk alleles that are common in one population but rare in others, with the
potential to illuminate pathophysiology, health disparities, and the population
genetic origins of disease alleles. Here we analysed 9.2 million single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin
Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In
addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated
with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers
SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The
association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and
replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk
haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present
at ~50% frequency in Native American samples and ~10% in east Asian, but is rare 
in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated
that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with
Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged
SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11
in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase
in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well
studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in
Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate
gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism.

Faithful maintenance and propagation of eukaryotic genomes is ensured by
three-step DNA ligation reactions used by ATP-dependent DNA ligases.
Paradoxically, when DNA ligases encounter nicked DNA structures with abnormal DNA
termini, DNA ligase catalytic activity can generate and/or exacerbate DNA damage 
through abortive ligation that produces chemically adducted, toxic 5'-adenylated 
(5'-AMP) DNA lesions. Aprataxin (APTX) reverses DNA adenylation but the context
for deadenylation repair is unclear. Here we examine the importance of APTX to
RNase-H2-dependent excision repair (RER) of a lesion that is very frequently
introduced into DNA, a ribonucleotide. We show that ligases generate adenylated
5' ends containing a ribose characteristic of RNase H2 incision. APTX efficiently
repairs adenylated RNA-DNA, and acting in an RNA-DNA damage response (RDDR),
promotes cellular survival and prevents S-phase checkpoint activation in budding 
yeast undergoing RER. Structure-function studies of human APTX-RNA-DNA-AMP-Zn
complexes define a mechanism for detecting and reversing adenylation at RNA-DNA
junctions. This involves A-form RNA binding, proper protein folding and
conformational changes, all of which are affected by heritable APTX mutations in 
ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1. Together, these results indicate that
accumulation of adenylated RNA-DNA may contribute to neurological disease.

Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm 
habitats. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with
manifold growth forms. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved
mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits
underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large 
species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as 
well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits
(that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to
freezing). To model the evolution of species' traits and climate occupancies, we 
combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223
species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into 
freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe
conduits and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during
freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing
cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered
labile, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy.
Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had
already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that
is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous 
woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only
after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the
trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new
structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these
solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.

The objective of science is to advance knowledge, primarily in two interlinked
ways: circulating ideas, and defending or criticizing the ideas of others. Peer
review acts as the gatekeeper to these mechanisms. Given the increasing concern
surrounding the reproducibility of much published research, it is critical to
understand whether peer review is intrinsically susceptible to failure, or
whether other extrinsic factors are responsible that distort scientists'
decisions. Here we show that even when scientists are motivated to promote the
truth, their behaviour may be influenced, and even dominated, by information
gleaned from their peers' behaviour, rather than by their personal dispositions. 
This phenomenon, known as herding, subjects the scientific community to an
inherent risk of converging on an incorrect answer and raises the possibility
that, under certain conditions, science may not be self-correcting. We further
demonstrate that exercising some subjectivity in reviewer decisions, which serves
to curb the herding process, can be beneficial for the scientific community in
processing available information to estimate truth more accurately. By examining 
the impact of different models of reviewer decisions on the dynamic process of
publication, and thereby on eventual aggregation of knowledge, we provide a new
perspective on the ongoing discussion of how the peer-review process may be
improved.

Splicing of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in eukaryotic cells is carried out
by the spliceosome, which consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs) and a number of accessory factors and enzymes. Each snRNP contains a
ring-shaped subcomplex of seven proteins and a specific RNA molecule. The U6
snRNP contains a unique heptameric Lsm protein complex, which specifically
recognizes the U6 small nuclear RNA at its 3' end. Here we report the crystal
structures of the heptameric Lsm complex, both by itself and in complex with a 3'
fragment of U6 snRNA, at 2.8 Å resolution. Each of the seven Lsm proteins
interacts with two neighbouring Lsm components to form a doughnut-shaped
assembly, with the order Lsm3-2-8-4-7-5-6. The four uridine nucleotides at the 3'
end of U6 snRNA are modularly recognized by Lsm3, Lsm2, Lsm8 and Lsm4, with the
uracil base specificity conferred by a highly conserved asparagine residue. The
uracil base at the extreme 3' end is sandwiched by His 36 and Arg 69 from Lsm3,
through π-π and cation-π interactions, respectively. The distinctive
end-recognition of U6 snRNA by the Lsm complex contrasts with RNA binding by the 
Sm complex in the other snRNPs. The structural features and associated
biochemical analyses deepen mechanistic understanding of the U6 snRNP function in
pre-mRNA splicing.

Many secretory proteins are targeted by signal sequences to a protein-conducting 
channel, formed by prokaryotic SecY or eukaryotic Sec61 complexes, and are
translocated across the membrane during their synthesis. Crystal structures of
the inactive channel show that the SecY subunit of the heterotrimeric complex
consists of two halves that form an hourglass-shaped pore with a constriction in 
the middle of the membrane and a lateral gate that faces the lipid phase. The
closed channel has an empty cytoplasmic funnel and an extracellular funnel that
is filled with a small helical domain, called the plug. During initiation of
translocation, a ribosome-nascent chain complex binds to the SecY (or Sec61)
complex, resulting in insertion of the nascent chain. However, the mechanism of
channel opening during translocation is unclear. Here we have addressed this
question by determining structures of inactive and active ribosome-channel
complexes with cryo-electron microscopy. Non-translating ribosome-SecY channel
complexes derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii or Escherichia coli show the
channel in its closed state, and indicate that ribosome binding per se causes
only minor changes. The structure of an active E. coli ribosome-channel complex
demonstrates that the nascent chain opens the channel, causing mostly rigid body 
movements of the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of SecY. In this early
translocation intermediate, the polypeptide inserts as a loop into the SecY
channel with the hydrophobic signal sequence intercalated into the open lateral
gate. The nascent chain also forms a loop on the cytoplasmic surface of SecY
rather than entering the channel directly.

In 1997, it was predicted that an electronically excited atom or molecule placed 
in a loosely bound chemical system (such as a hydrogen-bonded or
van-der-Waals-bonded cluster) could efficiently decay by transferring its excess 
energy to a neighbouring species that would then emit a low-energy electron. This
intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) process has since been shown to be a common 
phenomenon, raising questions about its role in DNA damage induced by ionizing
radiation, in which low-energy electrons are known to play an important part. It 
was recently suggested that ICD can be triggered efficiently and site-selectively
by resonantly core-exciting a target atom, which then transforms through Auger
decay into an ionic species with sufficiently high excitation energy to permit
ICD to occur. Here we show experimentally that resonant Auger decay can indeed
trigger ICD in dimers of both molecular nitrogen and carbon monoxide. By using
ion and electron momentum spectroscopy to measure simultaneously the charged
species created in the resonant-Auger-driven ICD cascade, we find that ICD occurs
in less time than the 20 femtoseconds it would take for individual molecules to
undergo dissociation. Our experimental confirmation of this process and its
efficiency may trigger renewed efforts to develop resonant X-ray excitation
schemes for more localized and targeted cancer radiation therapy.

Irradiation of matter with light tends to electronically excite atoms and
molecules, with subsequent relaxation processes determining where the photon
energy is ultimately deposited and electrons and ions produced. In weakly bound
systems, intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) enables very efficient relaxation
of electronic excitation through transfer of the excess energy to neighbouring
atoms or molecules that then lose an electron and become ionized. Here we propose
that the emission site and energy of the electrons released during this process
can be controlled by coupling the ICD to a resonant core excitation. We
illustrate this concept with ab initio many-body calculations on the
argon-krypton model system, where resonant photoabsorption produces an initial or
'parent' excitation of the argon atom, which then triggers a resonant-Auger-ICD
cascade that ends with the emission of a slow electron from the krypton atom. Our
calculations show that the energy of the emitted electrons depends sensitively on
the initial excited state of the argon atom. The incident energy can thus be
adjusted both to produce the initial excitation in a chosen atom and to realize
an excitation that will result in the emission of ICD electrons with desired
energies. These properties of the decay cascade might have consequences for
fundamental and applied radiation biology and could be of interest in the
development of new spectroscopic techniques.

RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of
biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt
complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive
computational and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing
approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro
systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be
sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of
RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures
are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA
structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This
method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which
reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing
to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in
excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the
high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome.
Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing
cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even 
thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the
importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of
mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent
processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside
cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA
structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding
whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable,
thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.

The protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei spp. cause important human and
livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. In mammalian blood, two developmental
forms of the parasite exist: proliferative 'slender' forms and arrested 'stumpy' 
forms that are responsible for transmission to tsetse flies. The slender to
stumpy differentiation is a density-dependent response that resembles quorum
sensing in microbial systems and is crucial for the parasite life cycle, ensuring
both infection chronicity and disease transmission. This response is triggered by
an elusive 'stumpy induction factor' (SIF) whose intracellular signalling pathway
is also uncharacterized. Laboratory-adapted (monomorphic) trypanosome strains
respond inefficiently to SIF but can generate forms with stumpy characteristics
when exposed to cell-permeable cAMP and AMP analogues. Exploiting this, we have
used a genome-wide RNA interference library screen to identify the signalling
components driving stumpy formation. In separate screens, monomorphic parasites
were exposed to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (pCPT-cAMP) or
8-pCPT-2'-O-methyl-5'-AMP to select cells that were unresponsive to these signals
and hence remained proliferative. Genome-wide Ion Torrent based RNAi target
sequencing identified cohorts of genes implicated in each step of the signalling 
pathway, from purine metabolism, through signal transducers (kinases,
phosphatases) to gene expression regulators. Genes at each step were
independently validated in cells naturally capable of stumpy formation,
confirming their role in density sensing in vivo. The putative RNA-binding
protein, RBP7, was required for normal quorum sensing and promoted cell-cycle
arrest and transmission competence when overexpressed. This study reveals that
quorum sensing signalling in trypanosomes shares similarities to fundamental
quiescence pathways in eukaryotic cells, its components providing targets for
quorum-sensing interference-based therapeutics.

The type I interferon (IFN) response protects cells from viral infection by
inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode
direct antiviral effectors. Recent screening studies have begun to catalogue ISGs
with antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, antiviral
ISG specificity across multiple distinct classes of viruses remains largely
unexplored. Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more 
than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11
genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance
virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target
positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense
single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor 
cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression
also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of
enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral
program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling. In vivo, 
genetic ablation of murine cGAS reveals its requirement in the antiviral response
to two DNA viruses, and an unappreciated contribution to the innate control of an
RNA virus. These studies uncover new paradigms for the preferential specificity
of IFN-mediated antiviral pathways spanning several virus families.

RNA viruses exist as genetically diverse populations. It is thought that
diversity and genetic structure of viral populations determine the rapid
adaptation observed in RNA viruses and hence their pathogenesis. However, our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution has been limited by
the inability to accurately describe the genetic structure of virus populations. 
Next-generation sequencing technologies generate data of sufficient depth to
characterize virus populations, but are limited in their utility because most
variants are present at very low frequencies and are thus indistinguishable from 
next-generation sequencing errors. Here we present an approach that reduces
next-generation sequencing errors and allows the description of virus populations
with unprecedented accuracy. Using this approach, we define the mutation rates of
poliovirus and uncover the mutation landscape of the population. Furthermore, by 
monitoring changes in variant frequencies on serially passaged populations, we
determined fitness values for thousands of mutations across the viral genome.
Mapping of these fitness values onto three-dimensional structures of viral
proteins offers a powerful approach for exploring structure-function
relationships and potentially uncovering new functions. To our knowledge, our
study provides the first single-nucleotide fitness landscape of an evolving RNA
virus and establishes a general experimental platform for studying the genetic
changes underlying the evolution of virus populations.

RNA structure has critical roles in processes ranging from ligand sensing to the 
regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing. However, a lack of
genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA 
structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a
high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq,
in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is
identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA
structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative
structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals 
a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as
well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and
shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We
also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative
polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5' splice sites that
correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs
annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA
structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted.
Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories
shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more
single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per
nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes 
in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the RNA structurome
and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be 
applicable to any organism.

Low-dimensional electronic systems have traditionally been obtained by
electrostatically confining electrons, either in heterostructures or in
intrinsically nanoscale materials such as single molecules, nanowires and
graphene. Recently, a new method has emerged with the recognition that
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which occur in systems with an
energy gap to quasiparticle excitations (such as insulators or superconductors), 
can host robust surface states that remain gapless as long as the relevant global
symmetry remains unbroken. The nature of the charge carriers in SPT surface
states is intimately tied to the symmetry of the bulk, resulting in one- and
two-dimensional electronic systems with novel properties. For example, time
reversal symmetry endows the massless charge carriers on the surface of a
three-dimensional topological insulator with helicity, fixing the orientation of 
their spin relative to their momentum. Weakly breaking this symmetry generates a 
gap on the surface, resulting in charge carriers with finite effective mass and
exotic spin textures. Analogous manipulations have yet to be demonstrated in
two-dimensional topological insulators, where the primary example of a SPT phase 
is the quantum spin Hall state. Here we demonstrate experimentally that
charge-neutral monolayer graphene has a quantum spin Hall state when it is
subjected to a very large magnetic field angled with respect to the graphene
plane. In contrast to time-reversal-symmetric systems, this state is protected by
a symmetry of planar spin rotations that emerges as electron spins in a
half-filled Landau level are polarized by the large magnetic field. The
properties of the resulting helical edge states can be modulated by balancing the
applied field against an intrinsic antiferromagnetic instability, which tends to 
spontaneously break the spin-rotation symmetry. In the resulting canted
antiferromagnetic state, we observe transport signatures of gapped edge states,
which constitute a new kind of one-dimensional electronic system with a tunable
bandgap and an associated spin texture.

Mitochondrial ribosomes synthesize a number of highly hydrophobic proteins
encoded on the genome of mitochondria, the organelles in eukaryotic cells that
are responsible for energy conversion by oxidative phosphorylation. The ribosomes
in mammalian mitochondria have undergone massive structural changes throughout
their evolution, including ribosomal RNA shortening and acquisition of
mitochondria-specific ribosomal proteins. Here we present the three-dimensional
structure of the 39S large subunit of the porcine mitochondrial ribosome
determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 4.9 Å resolution. The structure,
combined with data from chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry experiments, 
reveals the unique features of the 39S subunit at near-atomic resolution and
provides detailed insight into the architecture of the polypeptide exit site.
This region of the mitochondrial ribosome has been considerably remodelled
compared to its bacterial counterpart, providing a specialized platform for the
synthesis and membrane insertion of the highly hydrophobic protein components of 
the respiratory chain.

Nucleosomes are decorated with numerous post-translational modifications capable 
of influencing many DNA processes. Here we describe a new class of histone
modification, methylation of glutamine, occurring on yeast histone H2A at
position 105 (Q105) and human H2A at Q104. We identify Nop1 as the
methyltransferase in yeast and demonstrate that fibrillarin is the orthologue
enzyme in human cells. Glutamine methylation of H2A is restricted to the
nucleolus. Global analysis in yeast, using an H2AQ105me-specific antibody, shows 
that this modification is exclusively enriched over the 35S ribosomal DNA
transcriptional unit. We show that the Q105 residue is part of the binding site
for the histone chaperone FACT (facilitator of chromatin transcription) complex. 
Methylation of Q105 or its substitution to alanine disrupts binding to FACT in
vitro. A yeast strain mutated at Q105 shows reduced histone incorporation and
increased transcription at the ribosomal DNA locus. These features are
phenocopied by mutations in FACT complex components. Together these data identify
glutamine methylation of H2A as the first histone epigenetic mark dedicated to a 
specific RNA polymerase and define its function as a regulator of FACT
interaction with nucleosomes.

A major challenge for the development of a highly effective AIDS vaccine is the
identification of mechanisms of protective immunity. To address this question, we
used a nonhuman primate challenge model with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).
We show that antibodies to the SIV envelope are necessary and sufficient to
prevent infection. Moreover, sequencing of viruses from breakthrough infections
revealed selective pressure against neutralization-sensitive viruses; we
identified a two-amino-acid signature that alters antigenicity and confers
neutralization resistance. A similar signature confers resistance of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against
variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), suggesting that SIV and HIV share a fundamental 
mechanism of immune escape from vaccine-elicited or naturally elicited
antibodies. These analyses provide insight into the limited efficacy seen in HIV 
vaccine trials.

Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) is an important crop of temperate
climates which provides nearly 30% of the world's annual sugar production and is 
a source for bioethanol and animal feed. The species belongs to the order of
Caryophylalles, is diploid with 2n = 18 chromosomes, has an estimated genome size
of 714-758 megabases and shares an ancient genome triplication with other eudicot
plants. Leafy beets have been cultivated since Roman times, but sugar beet is one
of the most recently domesticated crops. It arose in the late eighteenth century 
when lines accumulating sugar in the storage root were selected from crosses made
with chard and fodder beet. Here we present a reference genome sequence for sugar
beet as the first non-rosid, non-asterid eudicot genome, advancing comparative
genomics and phylogenetic reconstructions. The genome sequence comprises 567
megabases, of which 85% could be assigned to chromosomes. The assembly covers a
large proportion of the repetitive sequence content that was estimated to be 63%.
We predicted 27,421 protein-coding genes supported by transcript data and
annotated them on the basis of sequence homology. Phylogenetic analyses provided 
evidence for the separation of Caryophyllales before the split of asterids and
rosids, and revealed lineage-specific gene family expansions and losses. We
sequenced spinach (Spinacia oleracea), another Caryophyllales species, and
validated features that separate this clade from rosids and asterids.
Intraspecific genomic variation was analysed based on the genome sequences of sea
beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima; progenitor of all beet crops) and four
additional sugar beet accessions. We identified seven million variant positions
in the reference genome, and also large regions of low variability, indicating
artificial selection. The sugar beet genome sequence enables the identification
of genes affecting agronomically relevant traits, supports molecular breeding and
maximizes the plant's potential in energy biotechnology.

Dislocations represent one of the most fascinating and fundamental concepts in
materials science. Most importantly, dislocations are the main carriers of
plastic deformation in crystalline materials. Furthermore, they can strongly
affect the local electronic and optical properties of semiconductors and ionic
crystals. In materials with small dimensions, they experience extensive image
forces, which attract them to the surface to release strain energy. However, in
layered crystals such as graphite, dislocation movement is mainly restricted to
the basal plane. Thus, the dislocations cannot escape, enabling their confinement
in crystals as thin as only two monolayers. To explore the nature of dislocations
under such extreme boundary conditions, the material of choice is bilayer
graphene, the thinnest possible quasi-two-dimensional crystal in which such
linear defects can be confined. Homogeneous and robust graphene membranes derived
from high-quality epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide provide an ideal platform
for their investigation. Here we report the direct observation of basal-plane
dislocations in freestanding bilayer graphene using transmission electron
microscopy and their detailed investigation by diffraction contrast analysis and 
atomistic simulations. Our investigation reveals two striking size effects.
First, the absence of stacking-fault energy, a unique property of bilayer
graphene, leads to a characteristic dislocation pattern that corresponds to an
alternating AB B[Symbol: see text]AC change of the stacking order. Second, our
experiments in combination with atomistic simulations reveal a pronounced
buckling of the bilayer graphene membrane that results directly from
accommodation of strain. In fact, the buckling changes the strain state of the
bilayer graphene and is of key importance for its electronic properties. Our
findings will contribute to the understanding of dislocations and of their role
in the structural, mechanical and electronic properties of bilayer and few-layer 
graphene.

Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions
of microorganisms residing in the human gut, but it remains unclear how rapidly
and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient
change. Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely
of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms
inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet 
increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and
Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant
polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii).
Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous
mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation.
Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including
bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and
activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between
dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering
inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut
microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the
diversity of human dietary lifestyles.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk variants for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These common variants have replicable but 
small effects on LOAD risk and generally do not have obvious functional effects. 
Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include
functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding
variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing
(WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants 
in several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3
(phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent
families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven independent
case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of
European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of
European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete
sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk
for Alzheimer's disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain
regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including
hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons
from Alzheimer's disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of
PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-β precursor protein
(APP) and extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the
amyloid-β peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in
extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40. Together, our genetic and functional data indicate
that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a twofold increased risk for LOAD and 
that PLD3 influences APP processing. This study provides an example of how
densely affected families may help to identify rare variants with large effects
on risk for disease or other complex traits.

Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes and secreted through
the biliary tract into the small intestine, where they aid in absorption of
lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Through a process known as enterohepatic
recirculation, more than 90% of secreted bile acids are then retrieved from the
intestine and returned to the liver for resecretion. In humans, there are two
Na(+)-dependent bile acid transporters involved in enterohepatic recirculation,
the Na(+)-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP; also known as SLC10A1) 
expressed in hepatocytes, and the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter
(ASBT; also known as SLC10A2) expressed on enterocytes in the terminal ileum. In 
recent years, ASBT has attracted much interest as a potential drug target for
treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, because inhibition of ASBT reduces
reabsorption of bile acids, thus increasing bile acid synthesis and consequently 
cholesterol consumption. However, a lack of three-dimensional structures of bile 
acid transporters hampers our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms of
substrate selectivity and transport, and to interpret the wealth of existing
functional data. The crystal structure of an ASBT homologue from Neisseria
meningitidis (ASBT(NM)) in detergent was reported recently, showing the protein
in an inward-open conformation bound to two Na(+) and a taurocholic acid.
However, the structural changes that bring bile acid and Na(+) across the
membrane are difficult to infer from a single structure. To understand the
structural changes associated with the coupled transport of Na(+) and bile acids,
here we solved two structures of an ASBT homologue from Yersinia frederiksenii
(ASBTYf) in a lipid environment, which reveal that a large rigid-body rotation of
a substrate-binding domain gives the conserved 'crossover' region, where two
discontinuous helices cross each other, alternating accessibility from either
side of the cell membrane. This result has implications for the location and
orientation of the bile acid during transport, as well as for the translocation
pathway for Na(+).

Acyl carrier protein (ACP) transports the growing fatty acid chain between
enzymatic domains of fatty acid synthase (FAS) during biosynthesis. Because FAS
enzymes operate on ACP-bound acyl groups, ACP must stabilize and transport the
growing lipid chain. ACPs have a central role in transporting starting materials 
and intermediates throughout the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. The transient
nature of ACP-enzyme interactions impose major obstacles to obtaining
high-resolution structural information about fatty acid biosynthesis, and a new
strategy is required to study protein-protein interactions effectively. Here we
describe the application of a mechanism-based probe that allows active
site-selective covalent crosslinking of AcpP to FabA, the Escherichia coli ACP
and fatty acid 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase, respectively. We report the 1.9 Å
crystal structure of the crosslinked AcpP-FabA complex as a homodimer in which
AcpP exhibits two different conformations, representing probable snapshots of ACP
in action: the 4'-phosphopantetheine group of AcpP first binds an arginine-rich
groove of FabA, then an AcpP helical conformational change locks AcpP and FabA in
place. Residues at the interface of AcpP and FabA are identified and validated by
solution nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, including chemical shift
perturbations and residual dipolar coupling measurements. These not only support 
our interpretation of the crystal structures but also provide an animated view of
ACP in action during fatty acid dehydration. These techniques, in combination
with molecular dynamics simulations, show for the first time that FabA extrudes
the sequestered acyl chain from the ACP binding pocket before dehydration by
repositioning helix III. Extensive sequence conservation among carrier proteins
suggests that the mechanistic insights gleaned from our studies may be broadly
applicable to fatty acid, polyketide and non-ribosomal biosynthesis. Here the
foundation is laid for defining the dynamic action of carrier-protein activity in
primary and secondary metabolism, providing insight into pathways that can have
major roles in the treatment of cancer, obesity and infectious disease.

In a small fraction of patients with schizophrenia or autism, alleles of
copy-number variants (CNVs) in their genomes are probably the strongest factors
contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease. These CNVs may provide an entry 
point for investigations into the mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction
alike. They are not fully penetrant and offer an opportunity to study their
effects separate from that of manifest disease. Here we show in an Icelandic
sample that a few of the CNVs clearly alter fecundity (measured as the number of 
children by age 45). Furthermore, we use various tests of cognitive function to
demonstrate that control subjects carrying the CNVs perform at a level that is
between that of schizophrenia patients and population controls. The CNVs do not
all affect the same cognitive domains, hence the cognitive deficits that drive or
accompany the pathogenesis vary from one CNV to another. Controls carrying the
chromosome 15q11.2 deletion between breakpoints 1 and 2 (15q11.2(BP1-BP2)
deletion) have a history of dyslexia and dyscalculia, even after adjusting for IQ
in the analysis, and the CNV only confers modest effects on other cognitive
traits. The 15q11.2(BP1-BP2) deletion affects brain structure in a pattern
consistent with both that observed during first-episode psychosis in
schizophrenia and that of structural correlates in dyslexia.

Terminal, monosubstituted alkenes are ideal prospective starting materials for
organic synthesis because they are manufactured on very large scales and can be
functionalized via a broad range of chemical transformations. Alkenes also have
the attractive feature of being stable in the presence of many acids, bases,
oxidants and reductants. In spite of these attributes, relatively few catalytic
enantioselective transformations have been developed that transform aliphatic
α-olefins into chiral products with an enantiomeric excess greater then 90 per
cent. With the exception of site-controlled isotactic polymerization of
α-olefins, none of these catalytic enantioselective processes results in
chain-extending carbon-carbon bond formation to the terminal carbon. Here we
describe a strategy that directly addresses this gap in synthetic methodology,
and present a single-flask, catalytic enantioselective conversion of terminal
alkenes into a number of chiral products. These reactions are facilitated by a
neighbouring functional group that accelerates palladium-catalysed cross-coupling
of 1,2-bis(boronates) relative to non-functionalized alkyl boronate analogues. In
tandem with enantioselective diboration, this reactivity feature transforms
alkene starting materials into a diverse array of chiral products. We note that
the tandem diboration/cross-coupling reaction generally provides products in high
yield and high selectivity (>95:5 enantiomer ratio), uses low loadings (1-2 mol
per cent) of commercially available catalysts and reagents, offers an expansive
substrate scope, and can address a broad range of alcohol and amine synthesis
targets, many of which cannot be easily addressed with current technology.

Adhesives are made of polymers because, unlike other materials, polymers ensure
good contact between surfaces by covering asperities, and retard the fracture of 
adhesive joints by dissipating energy under stress. But using polymers to 'glue' 
together polymer gels is difficult, requiring chemical reactions, heating, pH
changes, ultraviolet irradiation or an electric field. Here we show that strong, 
rapid adhesion between two hydrogels can be achieved at room temperature by
spreading a droplet of a nanoparticle solution on one gel's surface and then
bringing the other gel into contact with it. The method relies on the
nanoparticles' ability to adsorb onto polymer gels and to act as connectors
between polymer chains, and on the ability of polymer chains to reorganize and
dissipate energy under stress when adsorbed onto nanoparticles. We demonstrate
this approach by pressing together pieces of hydrogels, for approximately 30
seconds, that have the same or different chemical properties or rigidities, using
various solutions of silica nanoparticles, to achieve a strong bond. Furthermore,
we show that carbon nanotubes and cellulose nanocrystals that do not bond
hydrogels together become adhesive when their surface chemistry is modified. To
illustrate the promise of the method for biological tissues, we also glued
together two cut pieces of calf's liver using a solution of silica nanoparticles.
As a rapid, simple and efficient way to assemble gels or tissues, this method is 
desirable for many emerging technological and medical applications such as
microfluidics, actuation, tissue engineering and surgery.

Prokaryotic viruses have evolved various mechanisms to transport their genomes
across bacterial cell walls. Many bacteriophages use a tail to perform this
function, whereas tail-less phages rely on host organelles. However, the
tail-less, icosahedral, single-stranded DNA ΦX174-like coliphages do not fall
into these well-defined infection processes. For these phages, DNA delivery
requires a DNA pilot protein. Here we show that the ΦX174 pilot protein H
oligomerizes to form a tube whose function is most probably to deliver the DNA
genome across the host's periplasmic space to the cytoplasm. The 2.4 Å resolution
crystal structure of the in vitro assembled H protein's central domain consists
of a 170 Å-long α-helical barrel. The tube is constructed of ten α-helices with
their amino termini arrayed in a right-handed super-helical coiled-coil and their
carboxy termini arrayed in a left-handed super-helical coiled-coil. Genetic and
biochemical studies demonstrate that the tube is essential for infectivity but
does not affect in vivo virus assembly. Cryo-electron tomograms show that tubes
span the periplasmic space and are present while the genome is being delivered
into the host cell's cytoplasm. Both ends of the H protein contain transmembrane 
domains, which anchor the assembled tubes into the inner and outer cell
membranes. The central channel of the H-protein tube is lined with amide and
guanidinium side chains. This may be a general property of viral DNA conduits and
is likely to be critical for efficient genome translocation into the host.

How biological systems generate reproducible patterns with high precision is a
central question in science. The shoot apical meristem (SAM), a specialized
tissue producing plant aerial organs, is a developmental system of choice to
address this question. Organs are periodically initiated at the SAM at specific
spatial positions and this spatiotemporal pattern defines phyllotaxis.
Accumulation of the plant hormone auxin triggers organ initiation, whereas auxin 
depletion around organs generates inhibitory fields that are thought to be
sufficient to maintain these patterns and their dynamics. Here we show that
another type of hormone-based inhibitory fields, generated directly downstream of
auxin by intercellular movement of the cytokinin signalling inhibitor ARABIDOPSIS
HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 6 (AHP6), is involved in regulating
phyllotactic patterns. We demonstrate that AHP6-based fields establish patterns
of cytokinin signalling in the meristem that contribute to the robustness of
phyllotaxis by imposing a temporal sequence on organ initiation. Our findings
indicate that not one but two distinct hormone-based fields may be required for
achieving temporal precision during formation of reiterative structures at the
SAM, thus indicating an original mechanism for providing robustness to a dynamic 
developmental system.

River systems connect the terrestrial biosphere, the atmosphere and the ocean in 
the global carbon cycle. A recent estimate suggests that up to 3 petagrams of
carbon per year could be emitted as carbon dioxide (CO2) from global inland
waters, offsetting the carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems. It is generally
assumed that inland waters emit carbon that has been previously fixed upstream by
land plant photosynthesis, then transferred to soils, and subsequently
transported downstream in run-off. But at the scale of entire drainage basins,
the lateral carbon fluxes carried by small rivers upstream do not account for all
of the CO2 emitted from inundated areas downstream. Three-quarters of the world's
flooded land consists of temporary wetlands, but the contribution of these
productive ecosystems to the inland water carbon budget has been largely
overlooked. Here we show that wetlands pump large amounts of atmospheric CO2 into
river waters in the floodplains of the central Amazon. Flooded forests and
floating vegetation export large amounts of carbon to river waters and the
dissolved CO2 can be transported dozens to hundreds of kilometres downstream
before being emitted. We estimate that Amazonian wetlands export half of their
gross primary production to river waters as dissolved CO2 and organic carbon,
compared with only a few per cent of gross primary production exported in upland 
(not flooded) ecosystems. Moreover, we suggest that wetland carbon export is
potentially large enough to account for at least the 0.21 petagrams of carbon
emitted per year as CO2 from the central Amazon River and its floodplains. Global
carbon budgets should explicitly address temporary or vegetated flooded areas,
because these ecosystems combine high aerial primary production with large, fast 
carbon export, potentially supporting a substantial fraction of CO2 evasion from 
inland waters.

Respiratory surfaces are exposed to billions of particulates and pathogens daily.
A protective mucus barrier traps and eliminates them through mucociliary
clearance (MCC). However, excessive mucus contributes to transient respiratory
infections and to the pathogenesis of numerous respiratory diseases. MUC5AC and
MUC5B are evolutionarily conserved genes that encode structurally related mucin
glycoproteins, the principal macromolecules in airway mucus. Genetic variants are
linked to diverse lung diseases, but specific roles for MUC5AC and MUC5B in MCC, 
and the lasting effects of their inhibition, are unknown. Here we show that mouse
Muc5b (but not Muc5ac) is required for MCC, for controlling infections in the
airways and middle ear, and for maintaining immune homeostasis in mouse lungs,
whereas Muc5ac is dispensable. Muc5b deficiency caused materials to accumulate in
upper and lower airways. This defect led to chronic infection by multiple
bacterial species, including Staphylococcus aureus, and to inflammation that
failed to resolve normally. Apoptotic macrophages accumulated, phagocytosis was
impaired, and interleukin-23 (IL-23) production was reduced in Muc5b(-/-) mice.
By contrast, in mice that transgenically overexpress Muc5b, macrophage functions 
improved. Existing dogma defines mucous phenotypes in asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as driven by increased MUC5AC, with MUC5B
levels either unaffected or increased in expectorated sputum. However, in many
patients, MUC5B production at airway surfaces decreases by as much as 90%. By
distinguishing a specific role for Muc5b in MCC, and by determining its impact on
bacterial infections and inflammation in mice, our results provide a refined
framework for designing targeted therapies to control mucin secretion and restore
MCC.

During the neonatal period, activity-dependent neural-circuit remodelling
coincides with growth and refinement of the cerebral microvasculature. Whether
neural activity also influences the patterning of the vascular bed is not known. 
Here we show in neonatal mice, that neither reduction of sensory input through
whisker trimming nor moderately increased activity by environmental enrichment
affects cortical microvascular development. Unexpectedly, chronic stimulation by 
repetitive sounds, whisker deflection or motor activity led to a near arrest of
angiogenesis in barrel, auditory and motor cortices, respectively. Chemically
induced seizures also caused robust reductions in microvascular density. However,
altering neural activity in adult mice did not affect the vasculature.
Histological analysis and time-lapse in vivo two-photon microscopy revealed that 
hyperactivity did not lead to cell death or pruning of existing vessels but
rather to reduced endothelial proliferation and vessel sprouting. This
anti-angiogenic effect was prevented by administration of the nitric oxide
synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME and in mice with neuronal and inducible NOS
deficiency, suggesting that excessive nitric oxide released from hyperactive
interneurons and glia inhibited vessel growth. Vascular deficits persisted long
after cessation of hyperstimulation, providing evidence for a critical period
after which proper microvascular patterning cannot be re-established. Reduced
microvascular density diminished the ability of the brain to compensate for
hypoxic challenges, leading to dendritic spine loss in regions distant from
capillaries. Therefore, excessive sensorimotor stimulation and repetitive neural 
activation during early childhood may cause lifelong deficits in microvascular
reserve, which could have important consequences for brain development, function 
and pathology.

Excavations of a complex of caves in the Sierra de Atapuerca in northern Spain
have unearthed hominin fossils that range in age from the early Pleistocene to
the Holocene. One of these sites, the 'Sima de los Huesos' ('pit of bones'), has 
yielded the world's largest assemblage of Middle Pleistocene hominin fossils,
consisting of at least 28 individuals dated to over 300,000 years ago. The
skeletal remains share a number of morphological features with fossils classified
as Homo heidelbergensis and also display distinct Neanderthal-derived traits.
Here we determine an almost complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin
from Sima de los Huesos and show that it is closely related to the lineage
leading to mitochondrial genomes of Denisovans, an eastern Eurasian sister group 
to Neanderthals. Our results pave the way for DNA research on hominins from the
Middle Pleistocene.

Cohesion between sister chromatids, mediated by the chromosomal cohesin complex, 
is a prerequisite for faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis. Cohesin also
has vital roles in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The ring-shaped
cohesin complex is thought to encircle sister DNA strands, but its molecular
mechanism of action is poorly understood and the biochemical reconstitution of
cohesin activity in vitro has remained an unattained goal. Here we reconstitute
cohesin loading onto DNA using purified fission yeast cohesin and its loader
complex, Mis4(Scc2)-Ssl3(Scc4) (Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene names appear
throughout with their more commonly known Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterparts
added in superscript). Incubation of cohesin with DNA leads to spontaneous
topological loading, but this remains inefficient. The loader contacts cohesin at
multiple sites around the ring circumference, including the hitherto enigmatic
Psc3(Scc3) subunit, and stimulates cohesin's ATPase, resulting in efficient
topological loading. The in vitro reconstitution of cohesin loading onto DNA
provides mechanistic insight into the initial steps of the establishment of
sister chromatid cohesion and other chromosomal processes mediated by cohesin.

Acyl carrier protein represents one of the most highly conserved proteins across 
all domains of life and is nature's way of transporting hydrocarbon chains in
vivo. Notably, type II acyl carrier proteins serve as a crucial interaction hub
in primary cellular metabolism by communicating transiently between partner
enzymes of the numerous biosynthetic pathways. However, the highly transient
nature of such interactions and the inherent conformational mobility of acyl
carrier protein have stymied previous attempts to visualize structurally acyl
carrier protein tied to an overall catalytic cycle. This is essential to
understanding a fundamental aspect of cellular metabolism leading to compounds
that are not only useful to the cell, but also of therapeutic value. For example,
acyl carrier protein is central to the biosynthesis of the lipid A (endotoxin)
component of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative microorganisms, which is
required for their growth and survival, and is an activator of the mammalian
host's immune system, thus emerging as an important therapeutic target. During
lipid A synthesis (Raetz pathway), acyl carrier protein shuttles acyl
intermediates linked to its prosthetic 4'-phosphopantetheine group among four
acyltransferases, including LpxD. Here we report the crystal structures of three 
forms of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein engaging LpxD, which represent
stalled substrate and liberated products along the reaction coordinate. The
structures show the intricate interactions at the interface that optimally
position acyl carrier protein for acyl delivery and that directly involve the
pantetheinyl group. Conformational differences among the stalled acyl carrier
proteins provide the molecular basis for the association-dissociation process. An
unanticipated conformational shift of 4'-phosphopantetheine groups within the
LpxD catalytic chamber shows an unprecedented role of acyl carrier protein in
product release.

Wnts are evolutionarily conserved secreted signalling proteins that, in various
developmental contexts, spread from their site of synthesis to form a gradient
and activate target-gene expression at a distance. However, the requirement for
Wnts to spread has never been directly tested. Here we used genome engineering to
replace the endogenous wingless gene, which encodes the main Drosophila Wnt, with
one that expresses a membrane-tethered form of the protein. Surprisingly, the
resulting flies were viable and produced normally patterned appendages of nearly 
the right size, albeit with a delay. We show that, in the prospective wing,
prolonged wingless transcription followed by memory of earlier signalling allows 
persistent expression of relevant target genes. We suggest therefore that the
spread of Wingless is dispensable for patterning and growth even though it
probably contributes to increasing cell proliferation.

Graphene has attracted worldwide interest since its experimental discovery, but
the preparation of large-area, continuous graphene film on SiO2/Si wafers, free
from growth-related morphological defects or transfer-induced cracks and folds,
remains a formidable challenge. Growth of graphene by chemical vapour deposition 
on Cu foils has emerged as a powerful technique owing to its compatibility with
industrial-scale roll-to-roll technology. However, the polycrystalline nature and
microscopic roughness of Cu foils means that such roll-to-roll transferred films 
are not devoid of cracks and folds. High-fidelity transfer or direct growth of
high-quality graphene films on arbitrary substrates is needed to enable
wide-ranging applications in photonics or electronics, which include devices such
as optoelectronic modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors and tunnelling
barriers. The direct growth of graphene film on an insulating substrate, such as 
a SiO2/Si wafer, would be useful for this purpose, but current research efforts
remain grounded at the proof-of-concept stage, where only discontinuous,
nanometre-sized islands can be obtained. Here we develop a face-to-face transfer 
method for wafer-scale graphene films that is so far the only known way to
accomplish both the growth and transfer steps on one wafer. This spontaneous
transfer method relies on nascent gas bubbles and capillary bridges between the
graphene film and the underlying substrate during etching of the metal catalyst, 
which is analogous to the method used by tree frogs to remain attached to
submerged leaves. In contrast to the previous wet or dry transfer results, the
face-to-face transfer does not have to be done by hand and is compatible with any
size and shape of substrate; this approach also enjoys the benefit of a much
reduced density of transfer defects compared with the conventional transfer
method. Most importantly, the direct growth and spontaneous attachment of
graphene on the underlying substrate is amenable to batch processing in a
semiconductor production line, and thus will speed up the technological
application of graphene.

The evolutionary survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human
tuberculosis, depends on its ability to invade the host, replicate, and transmit 
infection. At its initial peripheral infection site in the distal lung airways,
M. tuberculosis infects macrophages, which transport it to deeper tissues. How
mycobacteria survive in these broadly microbicidal cells is an important
question. Here we show in mice and zebrafish that M. tuberculosis, and its close 
pathogenic relative Mycobacterium marinum, preferentially recruit and infect
permissive macrophages while evading microbicidal ones. This immune evasion is
accomplished by using cell-surface-associated phthiocerol dimycoceroserate (PDIM)
lipids to mask underlying pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the 
absence of PDIM, these PAMPs signal a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent
recruitment of macrophages that produce microbicidal reactive nitrogen species.
Concordantly, the related phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) promote the recruitment of 
permissive macrophages through a host chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-mediated
pathway. Thus, we have identified coordinated roles for PDIM, known to be
essential for mycobacterial virulence, and PGL, which (along with CCR2) is known 
to be associated with human tuberculosis. Our findings also suggest an
explanation for the longstanding observation that M. tuberculosis initiates
infection in the relatively sterile environment of the lower respiratory tract,
rather than in the upper respiratory tract, where resident microflora and inhaled
environmental microbes may continually recruit microbicidal macrophages through
TLR-dependent signalling.

Lentiviruses contain accessory genes that have evolved to counteract the effects 
of host cellular defence proteins that inhibit productive infection. One such
restriction factor, SAMHD1, inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1
infection of myeloid-lineage cells as well as resting CD4(+) T cells by reducing 
the cellular deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) concentration to a level at
which the viral reverse transcriptase cannot function. In other lentiviruses,
including HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), SAMHD1
restriction is overcome by the action of viral accessory protein x (Vpx) or the
related viral protein r (Vpr) that target and recruit SAMHD1 for proteasomal
degradation. The molecular mechanism by which these viral proteins are able to
usurp the host cell's ubiquitination machinery to destroy the cell's protection
against these viruses has not been defined. Here we present the crystal structure
of a ternary complex of Vpx with the human E3 ligase substrate adaptor DCAF1 and 
the carboxy-terminal region of human SAMHD1. Vpx is made up of a three-helical
bundle stabilized by a zinc finger motif, and wraps tightly around the
disc-shaped DCAF1 molecule to present a new molecular surface. This adapted
surface is then able to recruit SAMHD1 via its C terminus, making it a competent 
substrate for the E3 ligase to mark for proteasomal degradation. The structure
reported here provides a molecular description of how a lentiviral accessory
protein is able to subvert the cell's normal protein degradation pathway to
inactivate the cellular viral defence system.

Evolution drives, and is driven by, demography. A genotype moulds its phenotype's
age patterns of mortality and fertility in an environment; these two patterns in 
turn determine the genotype's fitness in that environment. Hence, to understand
the evolution of ageing, age patterns of mortality and reproduction need to be
compared for species across the tree of life. However, few studies have done so
and only for a limited range of taxa. Here we contrast standardized patterns over
age for 11 mammals, 12 other vertebrates, 10 invertebrates, 12 vascular plants
and a green alga. Although it has been predicted that evolution should inevitably
lead to increasing mortality and declining fertility with age after maturity,
there is great variation among these species, including increasing, constant,
decreasing, humped and bowed trajectories for both long- and short-lived species.
This diversity challenges theoreticians to develop broader perspectives on the
evolution of ageing and empiricists to study the demography of more species.

Galaxies observed at redshift z > 6, when the Universe was less than a billion
years old, thus far very rarely show evidence of the cold dust that accompanies
star formation in the local Universe, where the dust-to-gas mass ratio is around 
one per cent. A prototypical example is the galaxy Himiko (z = 6.6), which--a
mere 840 million years after the Big Bang--is forming stars at a rate of 30-100
solar masses per year, yielding a mass assembly time of about 150 × 10(6) years. 
Himiko is thought to have a low fraction (2-3 per cent of the Sun's) of elements 
heavier than helium (low metallicity), and although its gas mass cannot yet be
determined its dust-to-stellar mass ratio is constrained to be less than 0.05 per
cent. The local dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, which has a metallicity about 4 per
cent that of the Sun's and is forming stars less rapidly (assembly time about
1.6 × 10(9) years) than Himiko but still vigorously for its mass, is also very
dust deficient and is perhaps one of the best analogues of primitive galaxies
accessible to detailed study. Here we report observations of dust emission from
I Zw 18, from which we determine its dust mass to be 450-1,800 solar masses,
yielding a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of about 10(-6) to 10(-5) and a dust-to-gas
mass ratio of 3.2-13 × 10(-6). If I Zw 18 is a reasonable analogue of Himiko,
then Himiko's dust mass must be around 50,000 solar masses, a factor of 100 below
the current upper limit. These numbers are quite uncertain, but if most high-z
galaxies are more like Himiko than like the very-high-dust-mass galaxy SDSS
J114816.64 + 525150.3 at z ≈ 6, which hosts a quasar, then our prospects for
detecting the gas and dust inside such galaxies are much poorer than hitherto
anticipated.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly appreciated to be highly prevalent
and deleterious to neurological function. At present, no effective treatment
options are available, and little is known about the complex cellular response to
TBI during its acute phase. To gain insights into TBI pathogenesis, we developed 
a novel murine closed-skull brain injury model that mirrors some pathological
features associated with mild TBI in humans and used long-term intravital
microscopy to study the dynamics of the injury response from its inception. Here 
we demonstrate that acute brain injury induces vascular damage, meningeal cell
death, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately breach
the glial limitans and promote spread of the injury into the parenchyma. In
response, the brain elicits a neuroprotective, purinergic-receptor-dependent
inflammatory response characterized by meningeal neutrophil swarming and
microglial reconstitution of the damaged glial limitans. We also show that the
skull bone is permeable to small-molecular-weight compounds, and use this
delivery route to modulate inflammation and therapeutically ameliorate brain
injury through transcranial administration of the ROS scavenger, glutathione. Our
results shed light on the acute cellular response to TBI and provide a means to
locally deliver therapeutic compounds to the site of injury.

Since the nineteenth century, many synthetic organic chemists have focused on
developing new strategies to regio-, diastereo- and enantioselectively build
carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds in a predictable and efficient manner. 
Ideal syntheses should use the least number of synthetic steps, with few or no
functional group transformations and by-products, and maximum atom efficiency.
One potentially attractive method for the synthesis of molecular skeletons that
are difficult to prepare would be through the selective activation of C-H and C-C
bonds, instead of the conventional construction of new C-C bonds. Here we present
an approach that exploits the multifold reactivity of easily accessible
substrates with a single organometallic species to furnish complex molecular
scaffolds through the merging of otherwise difficult transformations: allylic C-H
and selective C-C bond activations. The resulting bifunctional nucleophilic
species, all of which have an all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centre, can then 
be selectively derivatized by the addition of two different electrophiles to
obtain more complex molecular architecture from these easily available starting
materials.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent histological cancer
subtype worldwide. As the majority of patients present with invasive, metastatic 
disease, it is vital to understand the basis for lung cancer progression. Hmga2
is highly expressed in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, in which it contributes to
cancer progression and metastasis. Here we show that Hmga2 promotes lung cancer
progression in mouse and human cells by operating as a competing endogenous RNA
(ceRNA) for the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family. Hmga2 can promote the
transformation of lung cancer cells independent of protein-coding function but
dependent upon the presence of let-7 sites; this occurs without changes in the
levels of let-7 isoforms, suggesting that Hmga2 affects let-7 activity by
altering miRNA targeting. These effects are also observed in vivo, where Hmga2
ceRNA activity drives lung cancer growth, invasion and dissemination. Integrated 
analysis of miRNA target prediction algorithms and metastatic lung cancer gene
expression data reveals the TGF-β co-receptor Tgfbr3 (ref. 12) as a putative
target of Hmga2 ceRNA function. Tgfbr3 expression is regulated by the Hmga2 ceRNA
through differential recruitment to Argonaute 2 (Ago2), and TGF-β signalling
driven by Tgfbr3 is important for Hmga2 to promote lung cancer progression.
Finally, analysis of NSCLC-patient gene-expression data reveals that HMGA2 and
TGFBR3 are coordinately regulated in NSCLC-patient material, a vital corollary to
ceRNA function. Taken together, these results suggest that Hmga2 promotes lung
carcinogenesis both as a protein-coding gene and as a non-coding RNA; such
dual-function regulation of gene-expression networks reflects a novel means by
which oncogenes promote disease progression.

Three-quarters of the oceanic crust formed at fast-spreading ridges is composed
of plutonic rocks whose mineral assemblages, textures and compositions record the
history of melt transport and crystallization between the mantle and the sea
floor. Despite the importance of these rocks, sampling them in situ is extremely 
challenging owing to the overlying dykes and lavas. This means that models for
understanding the formation of the lower crust are based largely on geophysical
studies and ancient analogues (ophiolites) that did not form at typical mid-ocean
ridges. Here we describe cored intervals of primitive, modally layered gabbroic
rocks from the lower plutonic crust formed at a fast-spreading ridge, sampled by 
the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program at the Hess Deep rift. Centimetre-scale,
modally layered rocks, some of which have a strong layering-parallel foliation,
confirm a long-held belief that such rocks are a key constituent of the lower
oceanic crust formed at fast-spreading ridges. Geochemical analysis of these
primitive lower plutonic rocks--in combination with previous geochemical data for
shallow-level plutonic rocks, sheeted dykes and lavas--provides the most
completely constrained estimate of the bulk composition of fast-spreading oceanic
crust so far. Simple crystallization models using this bulk crustal composition
as the parental melt accurately predict the bulk composition of both the lavas
and the plutonic rocks. However, the recovered plutonic rocks show early
crystallization of orthopyroxene, which is not predicted by current models of
melt extraction from the mantle and mid-ocean-ridge basalt differentiation. The
simplest explanation of this observation is that compositionally diverse melts
are extracted from the mantle and partly crystallize before mixing to produce the
more homogeneous magmas that erupt.

The increasing demands placed on natural resources for fuel and food production
require that we explore the use of efficient, sustainable feedstocks such as
brown macroalgae. The full potential of brown macroalgae as feedstocks for
commercial-scale fuel ethanol production, however, requires extensive
re-engineering of the alginate and mannitol catabolic pathways in the standard
industrial microbe Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we present the discovery of an 
alginate monomer (4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronate, or DEHU) transporter
from the alginolytic eukaryote Asteromyces cruciatus. The genomic integration and
overexpression of the gene encoding this transporter, together with the necessary
bacterial alginate and deregulated native mannitol catabolism genes, conferred
the ability of an S. cerevisiae strain to efficiently metabolize DEHU and
mannitol. When this platform was further adapted to grow on mannitol and DEHU
under anaerobic conditions, it was capable of ethanol fermentation from mannitol 
and DEHU, achieving titres of 4.6% (v/v) (36.2 g l(-1)) and yields up to 83% of
the maximum theoretical yield from consumed sugars. These results show that all
major sugars in brown macroalgae can be used as feedstocks for biofuels and
value-added renewable chemicals in a manner that is comparable to traditional
arable-land-based feedstocks.

The development of a multicellular organism and physiological responses require
massive coordinated changes in gene expression across several cell and tissue
types. Polymorphic regions of the genome that influence gene expression levels
have been identified by expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping in
many species, including loci that have cell-dependent, tissue-dependent and
age-dependent effects. However, there has been no comprehensive characterization 
of how polymorphisms influence the complex dynamic patterns of gene expression
that occur during development and in physiology. Here we describe an efficient
experimental design to infer gene expression dynamics from single expression
profiles in different genotypes, and apply it to characterize the effect of local
(cis) and distant (trans) genetic variation on gene expression at high temporal
resolution throughout a 12-hour period of the development of Caenorhabditis
elegans. Taking dynamic variation into account identifies >50% more cis-eQTLs,
including more than 900 that alter the dynamics of expression during this period.
Local sequence polymorphisms extensively affect the timing, rate, magnitude and
shape of expression changes. Indeed, many local sequence variants both increase
and decrease gene expression, depending on the time-point profiled. Expression
dynamics during this 12-hour period are also influenced extensively in trans by
distal loci. In particular, several trans loci influence genes with quite diverse
dynamic expression patterns, but they do so primarily during a common time
interval. Trans loci can therefore act as modifiers of expression during a
particular period of development. This study provides the first characterization,
to our knowledge, of the effect of local and distant genetic variation on the
dynamics of gene expression throughout an extensive time period. Moreover, the
approach developed here should facilitate the genetic dissection of other dynamic
processes, including potentially development, physiology and disease progression 
in humans.

The determination of protein crystal structures is hampered by the need for
macroscopic crystals. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) provide extremely intense
pulses of femtosecond duration, which allow data collection from nanometre- to
micrometre-sized crystals in a 'diffraction-before-destruction' approach. So far,
all protein structure determinations carried out using FELs have been based on
previous knowledge of related, known structures. Here we show that X-ray FEL data
can be used for de novo protein structure determination, that is, without
previous knowledge about the structure. Using the emerging technique of serial
femtosecond crystallography, we performed single-wavelength anomalous scattering 
measurements on microcrystals of the well-established model system lysozyme, in
complex with a lanthanide compound. Using Monte-Carlo integration, we obtained
high-quality diffraction intensities from which experimental phases could be
determined, resulting in an experimental electron density map good enough for
automated building of the protein structure. This demonstrates the feasibility of
determining novel protein structures using FELs. We anticipate that serial
femtosecond crystallography will become an important tool for the structure
determination of proteins that are difficult to crystallize, such as membrane
proteins.

Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin derivatives in southeast Asia
threatens malaria control and elimination activities worldwide. To monitor the
spread of artemisinin resistance, a molecular marker is urgently needed. Here,
using whole-genome sequencing of an artemisinin-resistant parasite line from
Africa and clinical parasite isolates from Cambodia, we associate mutations in
the PF3D7_1343700 kelch propeller domain ('K13-propeller') with artemisinin
resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mutant K13-propeller alleles cluster in
Cambodian provinces where resistance is prevalent, and the increasing frequency
of a dominant mutant K13-propeller allele correlates with the recent spread of
resistance in western Cambodia. Strong correlations between the presence of a
mutant allele, in vitro parasite survival rates and in vivo parasite clearance
rates indicate that K13-propeller mutations are important determinants of
artemisinin resistance. K13-propeller polymorphism constitutes a useful molecular
marker for large-scale surveillance efforts to contain artemisinin resistance in 
the Greater Mekong Subregion and prevent its global spread.

We present a high-quality genome sequence of a Neanderthal woman from Siberia. We
show that her parents were related at the level of half-siblings and that mating 
among close relatives was common among her recent ancestors. We also sequenced
the genome of a Neanderthal from the Caucasus to low coverage. An analysis of the
relationships and population history of available archaic genomes and 25
present-day human genomes shows that several gene flow events occurred among
Neanderthals, Denisovans and early modern humans, possibly including gene flow
into Denisovans from an unknown archaic group. Thus, interbreeding, albeit of low
magnitude, occurred among many hominin groups in the Late Pleistocene. In
addition, the high-quality Neanderthal genome allows us to establish a definitive
list of substitutions that became fixed in modern humans after their separation
from the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.

The North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG) plays a major part in the export of
carbon and other nutrients to the deep ocean. Primary production in the NPSG has 
increased in recent decades despite a reduction in nutrient supply to surface
waters. It is thought that this apparent paradox can be explained by a shift in
plankton community structure from mostly eukaryotes to mostly nitrogen-fixing
prokaryotes. It remains uncertain, however, whether the plankton community domain
shift can be linked to cyclical climate variability or a long-term global warming
trend. Here we analyse records of bulk and amino-acid-specific (15)N/(14)N
isotopic ratios (δ(15)N) preserved in the skeletons of long-lived deep-sea
proteinaceous corals collected from the Hawaiian archipelago; these isotopic
records serve as a proxy for the source of nitrogen-supported export production
through time. We find that the recent increase in nitrogen fixation is the
continuation of a much larger, centennial-scale trend. After a millennium of
relatively minor fluctuation, δ(15)N decreases between 1850 and the present. The 
total shift in δ(15)N of -2 per mil over this period is comparable to the total
change in global mean sedimentary δ(15)N across the Pleistocene-Holocene
transition, but it is happening an order of magnitude faster. We use a
steady-state model and find that the isotopic mass balance between nitrate and
nitrogen fixation implies a 17 to 27 per cent increase in nitrogen fixation over 
this time period. A comparison with independent records suggests that the
increase in nitrogen fixation might be linked to Northern Hemisphere climate
change since the end of the Little Ice Age.

The temperature in the crust of an accreting neutron star, which comprises its
outermost kilometre, is set by heating from nuclear reactions at large densities,
neutrino cooling and heat transport from the interior. The heated crust has been 
thought to affect observable phenomena at shallower depths, such as thermonuclear
bursts in the accreted envelope. Here we report that cycles of electron capture
and its inverse, β(-) decay, involving neutron-rich nuclei at a typical depth of 
about 150 metres, cool the outer neutron star crust by emitting neutrinos while
also thermally decoupling the surface layers from the deeper crust. This 'Urca'
mechanism has been studied in the context of white dwarfs and type Ia supernovae,
but hitherto was not considered in neutron stars, because previous models
computed the crust reactions using a zero-temperature approximation and assumed
that only a single nuclear species was present at any given depth. The thermal
decoupling means that X-ray bursts and other surface phenomena are largely
independent of the strength of deep crustal heating. The unexpectedly short
recurrence times, of the order of years, observed for very energetic
thermonuclear superbursts are therefore not an indicator of a hot crust, but may 
point instead to an unknown local heating mechanism near the neutron star
surface.

Crystallization is a fundamental and ubiquitous process much studied over the
centuries. But although the crystallization of atoms is fairly well understood,
it remains challenging to predict reliably the outcome of molecular
crystallization processes that are complicated by various molecular interactions 
and solvent involvement. This difficulty also applies to nanoparticles:
high-quality three-dimensional crystals are mostly produced using drying and
sedimentation techniques that are often impossible to rationalize and control to 
give a desired crystal symmetry, lattice spacing and habit (crystal shape). In
principle, DNA-mediated assembly of nanoparticles offers an ideal opportunity for
studying nanoparticle crystallization: a well-defined set of rules have been
developed to target desired lattice symmetries and lattice constants, and the
occurrence of features such as grain boundaries and twinning in DNA superlattices
and traditional crystals comprised of molecular or atomic building blocks
suggests that similar principles govern their crystallization. But the presence
of charged biomolecules, interparticle spacings of tens of nanometres, and the
realization so far of only polycrystalline DNA-interconnected nanoparticle
superlattices, all suggest that DNA-guided crystallization may differ from
traditional crystal growth. Here we show that very slow cooling, over several
days, of solutions of complementary-DNA-modified nanoparticles through the
melting temperature of the system gives the thermodynamic product with a specific
and uniform crystal habit. We find that our nanoparticle assemblies have the
Wulff equilibrium crystal structure that is predicted from theoretical
considerations and molecular dynamics simulations, thus establishing that DNA
hybridization can direct nanoparticle assembly along a pathway that mimics atomic
crystallization.

N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal (non-cap)
modification present in the messenger RNA of all higher eukaryotes. Although
essential to cell viability and development, the exact role of m(6)A modification
remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m(6)A demethylases in
mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m(6)A in basic biological functions
and disease. Here we show that m(6)A is selectively recognized by the human YTH
domain family 2 (YTHDF2) 'reader' protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We
identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs,
but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m(6)A)C.
We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding
of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to
mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies. The carboxy-terminal domain of
YTHDF2 selectively binds to m(6)A-containing mRNA, whereas the amino-terminal
domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular
RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m(6)A modification is
recognized by selectively binding proteins to affect the translation status and
lifetime of mRNA.

Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels catalyse rapid, highly selective influx of
Ca(2+) into cells despite a 70-fold higher extracellular concentration of Na(+). 
How CaV channels solve this fundamental biophysical problem remains unclear. Here
we report physiological and crystallographic analyses of a calcium selectivity
filter constructed in the homotetrameric bacterial NaV channel NaVAb. Our results
reveal interactions of hydrated Ca(2+) with two high-affinity Ca(2+)-binding
sites followed by a third lower-affinity site that would coordinate Ca(2+) as it 
moves inward. At the selectivity filter entry, Site 1 is formed by four carboxyl 
side chains, which have a critical role in determining Ca(2+) selectivity. Four
carboxyls plus four backbone carbonyls form Site 2, which is targeted by the
blocking cations Cd(2+) and Mn(2+), with single occupancy. The lower-affinity
Site 3 is formed by four backbone carbonyls alone, which mediate exit into the
central cavity. This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving
transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca(2+) ions bound in
the selectivity filter and supports a 'knock-off' mechanism of ion permeation
through a stepwise-binding process. The multi-ion selectivity filter of our CaVAb
model establishes a structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion 
selectivity and conductance by vertebrate CaV channels.

Human body-surface epithelia coexist in close association with complex bacterial 
communities and are protected by a variety of antibacterial proteins. C-type
lectins of the RegIII family are bactericidal proteins that limit direct contact 
between bacteria and the intestinal epithelium and thus promote tolerance to the 
intestinal microbiota. RegIII lectins recognize their bacterial targets by
binding peptidoglycan carbohydrate, but the mechanism by which they kill bacteria
is unknown. Here we elucidate the mechanistic basis for RegIII bactericidal
activity. We show that human RegIIIα (also known as HIP/PAP) binds membrane
phospholipids and kills bacteria by forming a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing
oligomeric pore. We derive a three-dimensional model of the RegIIIα pore by
docking the RegIIIα crystal structure into a cryo-electron microscopic map of the
pore complex, and show that the model accords with experimentally determined
properties of the pore. Lipopolysaccharide inhibits RegIIIα pore-forming
activity, explaining why RegIIIα is bactericidal for Gram-positive but not
Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings identify C-type lectins as mediators of
membrane attack in the mucosal immune system, and provide detailed insight into
an antibacterial mechanism that promotes mutualism with the resident microbiota.

The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native Americans 
seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus
with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we 
sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), 
from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge
this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1
mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high
frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and 
the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the
root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that
MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to 
modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests
that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more
north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, 
we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene
flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the
divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the
diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from
the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania 
from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological
characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another 
south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago,
revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region
was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our
findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native
Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but
also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans.

Comment in
    Hepatology. 2014 Aug;60(2):754-6.

Chemical or traumatic damage to the liver is frequently associated with aberrant 
healing (fibrosis) that overrides liver regeneration. The mechanism by which
hepatic niche cells differentially modulate regeneration and fibrosis during
liver repair remains to be defined. Hepatic vascular niche predominantly
represented by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells deploys paracrine trophogens,
known as angiocrine factors, to stimulate regeneration. Nevertheless, it is not
known how pro-regenerative angiocrine signals from liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells is subverted to promote fibrosis. Here, by combining an inducible
endothelial-cell-specific mouse gene deletion strategy and complementary models
of acute and chronic liver injury, we show that divergent angiocrine signals from
liver sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulate regeneration after immediate injury 
and provoke fibrosis after chronic insult. The pro-fibrotic transition of
vascular niche results from differential expression of stromal-derived factor-1
receptors, CXCR7 and CXCR4 (refs 18, 19, 20, 21), in liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells. After acute injury, CXCR7 upregulation in liver sinusoidal endothelial
cells acts with CXCR4 to induce transcription factor Id1, deploying
pro-regenerative angiocrine factors and triggering regeneration. Inducible
deletion of Cxcr7 in sinusoidal endothelial cells (Cxcr7(iΔEC/iΔEC)) from the
adult mouse liver impaired liver regeneration by diminishing Id1-mediated
production of angiocrine factors. By contrast, after chronic injury inflicted by 
iterative hepatotoxin (carbon tetrachloride) injection and bile duct ligation,
constitutive FGFR1 signalling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
counterbalanced CXCR7-dependent pro-regenerative response and augmented CXCR4
expression. This predominance of CXCR4 over CXCR7 expression shifted angiocrine
response of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stimulating proliferation of
desmin(+) hepatic stellate-like cells and enforcing a pro-fibrotic vascular
niche. Endothelial-cell-specific ablation of either Fgfr1 (Fgfr1(iΔEC/iΔEC)) or
Cxcr4 (Cxcr4(iΔEC/iΔEC)) in mice restored the pro-regenerative pathway and
prevented FGFR1-mediated maladaptive subversion of angiocrine factors. Similarly,
selective CXCR7 activation in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells abrogated
fibrogenesis. Thus, we demonstrate that in response to liver injury, differential
recruitment of pro-regenerative CXCR7-Id1 versus pro-fibrotic FGFR1-CXCR4
angiocrine pathways in vascular niche balances regeneration and fibrosis. These
results provide a therapeutic roadmap to achieve hepatic regeneration without
provoking fibrosis.

Synchronization of spiking activity in neuronal networks is a fundamental process
that enables the precise transmission of information to drive behavioural
responses. In cortical areas, synchronization of principal-neuron spiking
activity is an effective mechanism for information coding that is regulated by
GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-ergic interneurons through the generation of neuronal 
oscillations. Although neuronal synchrony has been demonstrated to be crucial for
sensory, motor and cognitive processing, it has not been investigated at the
level of defined circuits involved in the control of emotional behaviour.
Converging evidence indicates that fear behaviour is regulated by the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). This control over fear behaviour relies on the
activation of specific prefrontal projections to the basolateral complex of the
amygdala (BLA), a structure that encodes associative fear memories. However, it
remains to be established how the precise temporal control of fear behaviour is
achieved at the level of prefrontal circuits. Here we use single-unit recordings 
and optogenetic manipulations in behaving mice to show that fear expression is
causally related to the phasic inhibition of prefrontal parvalbumin interneurons 
(PVINs). Inhibition of PVIN activity disinhibits prefrontal projection neurons
and synchronizes their firing by resetting local theta oscillations, leading to
fear expression. Our results identify two complementary neuronal mechanisms
mediated by PVINs that precisely coordinate and enhance the neuronal activity of 
prefrontal projection neurons to drive fear expression.

Eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled by a complex pathway that extends from the
nucleolus to the cytoplasm and is powered by many energy-consuming enzymes.
Nuclear export is a key, irreversible step in pre-ribosome maturation, but
mechanisms underlying the timely acquisition of export competence remain poorly
understood. Here we show that a conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae GTPase Nug2
(also known as Nog2, and as NGP-1, GNL2 or nucleostemin 2 in human) has a key
role in the timing of export competence. Nug2 binds the inter-subunit face of
maturing, nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles, and the location clashes with the
position of Nmd3, a key pre-60S export adaptor. Nug2 and Nmd3 are not present on 
the same pre-60S particles, with Nug2 binding before Nmd3. Depletion of Nug2
causes premature Nmd3 binding to the pre-60S particles, whereas mutations in the 
G-domain of Nug2 block Nmd3 recruitment, resulting in severe 60S export defects. 
Two pre-60S remodelling factors, the Rea1 ATPase and its co-substrate Rsa4, are
present on Nug2-associated particles, and both show synthetic lethal interactions
with nug2 mutants. Release of Nug2 from pre-60S particles requires both its
K(+)-dependent GTPase activity and the remodelling ATPase activity of Rea1. We
conclude that Nug2 is a regulatory GTPase that monitors pre-60S maturation, with 
release from its placeholder site linked to recruitment of the nuclear export
machinery.

Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) belongs to the most dangerous class of
bioweapons. Despite this, BoNT/A is used to treat a wide range of common medical 
conditions such as migraines and a variety of ocular motility and movement
disorders. BoNT/A is probably best known for its use as an antiwrinkle agent in
cosmetic applications (including Botox and Dysport). BoNT/A application causes
long-lasting flaccid paralysis of muscles through inhibiting the release of the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine by cleaving synaptosomal-associated protein 25
(SNAP-25) within presynaptic nerve terminals. Two types of BoNT/A receptor have
been identified, both of which are required for BoNT/A toxicity and are therefore
likely to cooperate with each other: gangliosides and members of the synaptic
vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) family, which are putative transporter proteins that
are predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, associate with the
receptor-binding domain of the toxin. Recently, fibroblast growth factor receptor
3 (FGFR3) has also been reported to be a potential BoNT/A receptor. In SV2
proteins, the BoNT/A-binding site has been mapped to the luminal domain, but the 
molecular details of the interaction between BoNT/A and SV2 are unknown. Here we 
determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the BoNT/A receptor-binding
domain (BoNT/A-RBD) in complex with the SV2C luminal domain (SV2C-LD). SV2C-LD
consists of a right-handed, quadrilateral β-helix that associates with BoNT/A-RBD
mainly through backbone-to-backbone interactions at open β-strand edges, in a
manner that resembles the inter-strand interactions in amyloid structures.
Competition experiments identified a peptide that inhibits the formation of the
complex. Our findings provide a strong platform for the development of novel
antitoxin agents and for the rational design of BoNT/A variants with improved
therapeutic properties.

Plant species diversity in Eurasian wetlands and grasslands depends not only on
productivity but also on the relative availability of nutrients, particularly of 
nitrogen and phosphorus. Here we show that the impacts of nitrogen:phosphorus
stoichiometry on plant species richness can be explained by selected plant
life-history traits, notably by plant investments in growth versus reproduction. 
In 599 Eurasian sites with herbaceous vegetation we examined the relationship
between the local nutrient conditions and community-mean life-history traits. We 
found that compared with plants in nitrogen-limited communities, plants in
phosphorus-limited communities invest little in sexual reproduction (for example,
less investment in seed, shorter flowering period, longer lifespan) and have
conservative leaf economy traits (that is, a low specific leaf area and a high
leaf dry-matter content). Endangered species were more frequent in
phosphorus-limited ecosystems and they too invested little in sexual
reproduction. The results provide new insight into how plant adaptations to
nutrient conditions can drive the distribution of plant species in natural
ecosystems and can account for the vulnerability of endangered species.

Climate influences the erosion processes acting at the Earth's surface. However, 
the effect of cooling during the Late Cenozoic era, including the onset of
Pliocene-Pleistocene Northern Hemisphere glaciation (about two to three million
years ago), on global erosion rates remains unclear. The uncertainty arises
mainly from a lack of consensus on the use of the sedimentary record as a proxy
for erosion and the difficulty of isolating the respective contributions of
tectonics and climate to erosion. Here we compile 18,000 bedrock
thermochronometric ages from around the world and use a formal inversion
procedure to estimate temporal and spatial variations in erosion rates. This
allows for the quantification of erosion for the source areas that ultimately
produce the sediment record on a timescale of millions of years. We find that
mountain erosion rates have increased since about six million years ago and most 
rapidly since two million years ago. The increase of erosion rates is observed at
all latitudes, but is most pronounced in glaciated mountain ranges, indicating
that glacial processes played an important part. Because mountains represent a
considerable fraction of the global production of sediments, our results imply an
increase in sediment flux at a global scale that coincides closely with enhanced 
cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs.

Recent analysis of satellite data obtained during the 9 October 2012 geomagnetic 
storm identified the development of peaks in electron phase space density, which 
are compelling evidence for local electron acceleration in the heart of the outer
radiation belt, but are inconsistent with acceleration by inward radial diffusive
transport. However, the precise physical mechanism responsible for the
acceleration on 9 October was not identified. Previous modelling has indicated
that a magnetospheric electromagnetic emission known as chorus could be a
potential candidate for local electron acceleration, but a definitive resolution 
of the importance of chorus for radiation-belt acceleration was not possible
because of limitations in the energy range and resolution of previous electron
observations and the lack of a dynamic global wave model. Here we report
high-resolution electron observations obtained during the 9 October storm and
demonstrate, using a two-dimensional simulation performed with a recently
developed time-varying data-driven model, that chorus scattering explains the
temporal evolution of both the energy and angular distribution of the observed
relativistic electron flux increase. Our detailed modelling demonstrates the
remarkable efficiency of wave acceleration in the Earth's outer radiation belt,
and the results presented have potential application to Jupiter, Saturn and other
magnetized astrophysical objects.

Strigolactones (SLs), a newly discovered class of carotenoid-derived
phytohormones, are essential for developmental processes that shape plant
architecture and interactions with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi. Despite the rapid progress in elucidating the SL biosynthetic 
pathway, the perception and signalling mechanisms of SL remain poorly understood.
Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that
SLs induce its degradation. We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant,
which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is 
caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL
treatment. The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp
ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the α/β hydrolase protein DWARF 14
(D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling
components potentially responsible for SL perception. We demonstrate that, in a
D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and
abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth. Our combined genetic
and biochemical data reveal that D53 acts as a repressor of the SL signalling
pathway, whose hormone-induced degradation represents a key molecular link
between SL perception and responses.

Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that control 
plant shoot branching. SL signalling requires the hormone-dependent interaction
of DWARF 14 (D14), a probable candidate SL receptor, with DWARF 3 (D3), an F-box 
component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Here we
report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa)
mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the
SCF(D3) ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling.
Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the
proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase,
whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation.
Moreover, D53 can interact with transcriptional co-repressors known as
TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS. Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that
involves SL-dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14-D3
complex.

Genomic imprinting is an allele-specific gene expression system that is important
for mammalian development and function. The molecular basis of genomic imprinting
is allele-specific DNA methylation. Although it is well known that the de novo
DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are responsible for the establishment of
genomic imprinting, how the methylation mark is erased during primordial germ
cell (PGC) reprogramming remains unclear. Tet1 is one of the ten-eleven
translocation family proteins, which have the capacity to oxidize
5-methylcytosine (5mC), specifically expressed in reprogramming PGCs. Here we
report that Tet1 has a critical role in the erasure of genomic imprinting. We
show that despite their identical genotype, progenies derived from mating between
Tet1 knockout males and wild-Peg10 and Peg3, which exhibit aberrant
hypermethylation in the paternal allele of differential methylated regions
(DMRs). RNA-seq reveals extensive dysregulation of imprinted genes in the next
generation due to paternal loss of Tet1 function. Genome-wide DNA methylation
analysis of embryonic day 13.5 PGCs and sperm of Tet1 knockout mice revealed
hypermethylation of DMRs of imprinted genes in sperm, which can be traced back to
PGCs. Analysis of the DNA methylation dynamics in reprogramming PGCs indicates
that Tet1 functions to wipe out remaining methylation, including imprinted genes,
at the late reprogramming stage. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the 
role of Tet1 in the erasure of paternal imprints in the female germ line. Thus,
our study establishes a critical function of Tet1 in the erasure of genomic
imprinting.

Two large-scale pharmacogenomic studies were published recently in this journal. 
Genomic data are well correlated between studies; however, the measured drug
response data are highly discordant. Although the source of inconsistencies
remains uncertain, it has potential implications for using these outcome measures
to assess gene-drug associations or select potential anticancer drugs on the
basis of their reported results.

To achieve its precise neural connectivity, the developing mammalian nervous
system undergoes extensive activity-dependent synapse remodelling. Recently,
microglial cells have been shown to be responsible for a portion of synaptic
pruning, but the remaining mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report a new role
for astrocytes in actively engulfing central nervous system synapses. This
process helps to mediate synapse elimination, requires the MEGF10 and MERTK
phagocytic pathways, and is strongly dependent on neuronal activity. Developing
mice deficient in both astrocyte pathways fail to refine their retinogeniculate
connections normally and retain excess functional synapses. Finally, we show that
in the adult mouse brain, astrocytes continuously engulf both excitatory and
inhibitory synapses. These studies reveal a novel role for astrocytes in
mediating synapse elimination in the developing and adult brain, identify MEGF10 
and MERTK as critical proteins in the synapse remodelling underlying neural
circuit refinement, and have important implications for understanding learning
and memory as well as neurological disease processes.

Quantum error correction codes are designed to protect an arbitrary state of a
multi-qubit register from decoherence-induced errors, but their implementation is
an outstanding challenge in the development of large-scale quantum computers. The
first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a simple quantum system,
such as a quantum bit (qubit) or a cavity mode, in the presence of decoherence.
This has recently been accomplished using measurement-based feedback schemes. The
next step is to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system. Here we
demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of
two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is achieved using an
autonomous feedback scheme that combines continuous drives along with a
specifically engineered coupling between the two-qubit register and a dissipative
reservoir. Similar autonomous feedback techniques have been used for qubit reset,
single-qubit state stabilization, and the creation and stabilization of states of
multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based schemes, the
autonomous approach uses engineered dissipation to counteract decoherence,
obviating the need for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors.
Instead, the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady
state of the system in the presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an
essential building block for quantum information processing. Such autonomous
schemes, which are broadly applicable to a variety of physical systems, as
demonstrated by the accompanying paper on trapped ion qubits, will be an
essential tool for the implementation of quantum error correction.

Entangled states are a key resource in fundamental quantum physics, quantum
cryptography and quantum computation. Introduction of controlled unitary
processes--quantum gates--to a quantum system has so far been the most widely
used method to create entanglement deterministically. These processes require
high-fidelity state preparation and minimization of the decoherence that
inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the environment, and
imperfect control of the system parameters. Here we combine unitary processes
with engineered dissipation to deterministically produce and stabilize an
approximate Bell state of two trapped-ion quantum bits (qubits), independent of
their initial states. Compared with previous studies that involved dissipative
entanglement of atomic ensembles or the application of sequences of multiple
time-dependent gates to trapped ions, we implement our combined process using
trapped-ion qubits in a continuous time-independent fashion (analogous to optical
pumping of atomic states). By continuously driving the system towards the steady 
state, entanglement is stabilized even in the presence of experimental noise and 
decoherence. Our demonstration of an entangled steady state of two qubits
represents a step towards dissipative state engineering, dissipative quantum
computation and dissipative phase transitions. Following this approach,
engineered coupling to the environment may be applied to a broad range of
experimental systems to achieve desired quantum dynamics or steady states.
Indeed, concurrently with this work, an entangled steady state of two
superconducting qubits was demonstrated using dissipation.

Intestinal microbes provide multicellular hosts with nutrients and confer
resistance to infection. The delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory 
mechanisms, essential for gut immune homeostasis, is affected by the composition 
of the commensal microbial community. Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) expressing 
transcription factor Foxp3 have a key role in limiting inflammatory responses in 
the intestine. Although specific members of the commensal microbial community
have been found to potentiate the generation of anti-inflammatory Treg or
pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells, the molecular cues driving this
process remain elusive. Considering the vital metabolic function afforded by
commensal microorganisms, we reasoned that their metabolic by-products are sensed
by cells of the immune system and affect the balance between pro- and
anti-inflammatory cells. We tested this hypothesis by exploring the effect of
microbial metabolites on the generation of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. We found
that in mice a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), butyrate, produced by commensal
microorganisms during starch fermentation, facilitated extrathymic generation of 
Treg cells. A boost in Treg-cell numbers after provision of butyrate was due to
potentiation of extrathymic differentiation of Treg cells, as the observed
phenomenon was dependent on intronic enhancer CNS1 (conserved non-coding sequence
1), essential for extrathymic but dispensable for thymic Treg-cell
differentiation. In addition to butyrate, de novo Treg-cell generation in the
periphery was potentiated by propionate, another SCFA of microbial origin capable
of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, but not acetate, which lacks this
HDAC-inhibitory activity. Our results suggest that bacterial metabolites mediate 
communication between the commensal microbiota and the immune system, affecting
the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.

Glucose homeostasis is a vital and complex process, and its disruption can cause 
hyperglycaemia and type II diabetes mellitus. Glucokinase (GK), a key enzyme that
regulates glucose homeostasis, converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in
pancreatic β-cells, liver hepatocytes, specific hypothalamic neurons, and gut
enterocytes. In hepatocytes, GK regulates glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, 
suppresses glucose production, and is subject to the endogenous inhibitor GK
regulatory protein (GKRP). During fasting, GKRP binds, inactivates and sequesters
GK in the nucleus, which removes GK from the gluconeogenic process and prevents a
futile cycle of glucose phosphorylation. Compounds that directly hyperactivate GK
(GK activators) lower blood glucose levels and are being evaluated clinically as 
potential therapeutics for the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. However,
initial reports indicate that an increased risk of hypoglycaemia is associated
with some GK activators. To mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia, we sought to
increase GK activity by blocking GKRP. Here we describe the identification of two
potent small-molecule GK-GKRP disruptors (AMG-1694 and AMG-3969) that normalized 
blood glucose levels in several rodent models of diabetes. These compounds
potently reversed the inhibitory effect of GKRP on GK activity and promoted GK
translocation both in vitro (isolated hepatocytes) and in vivo (liver). A
co-crystal structure of full-length human GKRP in complex with AMG-1694 revealed 
a previously unknown binding pocket in GKRP distinct from that of the
phosphofructose-binding site. Furthermore, with AMG-1694 and AMG-3969 (but not GK
activators), blood glucose lowering was restricted to diabetic and not
normoglycaemic animals. These findings exploit a new cellular mechanism for
lowering blood glucose levels with reduced potential for hypoglycaemic risk in
patients with type II diabetes mellitus.

Gut commensal microbes shape the mucosal immune system by regulating the
differentiation and expansion of several types of T cell. Clostridia, a dominant 
class of commensal microbe, can induce colonic regulatory T (Treg) cells, which
have a central role in the suppression of inflammatory and allergic responses.
However, the molecular mechanisms by which commensal microbes induce colonic Treg
cells have been unclear. Here we show that a large bowel microbial fermentation
product, butyrate, induces the differentiation of colonic Treg cells in mice. A
comparative NMR-based metabolome analysis suggests that the luminal
concentrations of short-chain fatty acids positively correlates with the number
of Treg cells in the colon. Among short-chain fatty acids, butyrate induced the
differentiation of Treg cells in vitro and in vivo, and ameliorated the
development of colitis induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) T cells 
in Rag1(-/-) mice. Treatment of naive T cells under the Treg-cell-polarizing
conditions with butyrate enhanced histone H3 acetylation in the promoter and
conserved non-coding sequence regions of the Foxp3 locus, suggesting a possible
mechanism for how microbial-derived butyrate regulates the differentiation of
Treg cells. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which
host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.

Heterotaxy is a disorder of left-right body patterning, or laterality, that is
associated with major congenital heart disease. The aetiology and mechanisms
underlying most cases of human heterotaxy are poorly understood. In vertebrates, 
laterality is initiated at the embryonic left-right organizer, where motile cilia
generate leftward flow that is detected by immotile sensory cilia, which
transduce flow into downstream asymmetric signals. The mechanism that specifies
these two cilia types remains unknown. Here we show that the
N-acetylgalactosamine-type O-glycosylation enzyme GALNT11 is crucial to such
determination. We previously identified GALNT11 as a candidate disease gene in a 
patient with heterotaxy, and now demonstrate, in Xenopus tropicalis, that galnt11
activates Notch signalling. GALNT11 O-glycosylates human NOTCH1 peptides in
vitro, thereby supporting a mechanism of Notch activation either by increasing
ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of the Notch receptor or by modification of
specific EGF repeats. We further developed a quantitative live imaging technique 
for Xenopus left-right organizer cilia and show that Galnt11-mediated Notch1
signalling modulates the spatial distribution and ratio of motile and immotile
cilia at the left-right organizer. galnt11 or notch1 depletion increases the
ratio of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia and produces a laterality 
defect reminiscent of loss of the ciliary sensor Pkd2. By contrast, Notch
overexpression decreases this ratio, mimicking the ciliopathy primary ciliary
dyskinesia. Together our data demonstrate that Galnt11 modifies Notch,
establishing an essential balance between motile and immotile cilia at the
left-right organizer to determine laterality, and reveal a novel mechanism for
human heterotaxy.

Development of a self-tolerant T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire with the
potential to recognize the universe of infectious agents depends on proper
regulation of TCR signalling. The repertoire is whittled down during T-cell
development in the thymus by the ability of quasi-randomly generated TCRs to
interact with self-peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
proteins. Low-affinity TCR interactions with self-MHC proteins generate weak
signals that initiate 'positive selection', causing maturation of CD4- or
CD8αβ-expressing 'single-positive' thymocytes from CD4(+)CD8αβ(+)
'double-positive' precursors. These develop into mature naive T cells of the
secondary lymphoid organs. TCR interaction with high-affinity agonist
self-ligands results in 'negative selection' by activation-induced apoptosis or
'agonist selection' of functionally differentiated self-antigen-experienced T
cells. Here we show that positive selection is enabled by the ability of the
T-cell-specific protein Themis to specifically attenuate TCR signal strength via 
SHP1 recruitment and activation in response to low- but not high-affinity TCR
engagement. Themis acts as an analog-to-digital converter translating graded TCR 
affinity into clear-cut selection outcome. By dampening mild TCR signals Themis
increases the affinity threshold for activation, enabling positive selection of T
cells with a naive phenotype in response to low-affinity self-antigens.

Myocardial infarction, a leading cause of death in the Western world, usually
occurs when the fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary
artery ruptures. The resulting exposure of blood to the atherosclerotic material 
then triggers thrombus formation, which occludes the artery. The importance of
genetic predisposition to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is
best documented by the predictive value of a positive family history.
Next-generation sequencing in families with several affected individuals has
revolutionized mutation identification. Here we report the segregation of two
private, heterozygous mutations in two functionally related genes, GUCY1A3
(p.Leu163Phefs*24) and CCT7 (p.Ser525Leu), in an extended myocardial infarction
family. GUCY1A3 encodes the α1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (α1-sGC), and 
CCT7 encodes CCTη, a member of the tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex,
which, among other functions, stabilizes soluble guanylyl cyclase. After
stimulation with nitric oxide, soluble guanylyl cyclase generates cGMP, which
induces vasodilation and inhibits platelet activation. We demonstrate in vitro
that mutations in both GUCY1A3 and CCT7 severely reduce α1-sGC as well as β1-sGC 
protein content, and impair soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Moreover,
platelets from digenic mutation carriers contained less soluble guanylyl cyclase 
protein and consequently displayed reduced nitric-oxide-induced cGMP formation.
Mice deficient in α1-sGC protein displayed accelerated thrombus formation in the 
microcirculation after local trauma. Starting with a severely affected family, we
have identified a link between impaired soluble-guanylyl-cyclase-dependent nitric
oxide signalling and myocardial infarction risk, possibly through accelerated
thrombus formation. Reversing this defect may provide a new therapeutic target
for reducing the risk of myocardial infarction.

Deficits in eye contact have been a hallmark of autism since the condition's
initial description. They are cited widely as a diagnostic feature and figure
prominently in clinical instruments; however, the early onset of these deficits
has not been known. Here we show in a prospective longitudinal study that infants
later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) exhibit mean decline in eye
fixation from 2 to 6 months of age, a pattern not observed in infants who do not 
develop ASD. These observations mark the earliest known indicators of social
disability in infancy, but also falsify a prior hypothesis: in the first months
of life, this basic mechanism of social adaptive action--eye looking--is not
immediately diminished in infants later diagnosed with ASD; instead, eye looking 
appears to begin at normative levels prior to decline. The timing of decline
highlights a narrow developmental window and reveals the early derailment of
processes that would otherwise have a key role in canalizing typical social
development. Finally, the observation of this decline in eye fixation--rather
than outright absence--offers a promising opportunity for early intervention that
could build on the apparent preservation of mechanisms subserving reflexive
initial orientation towards the eyes.

The Xist long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is essential for X-chromosome inactivation
(XCI), the process by which mammals compensate for unequal numbers of sex
chromosomes. During XCI, Xist coats the future inactive X chromosome (Xi) and
recruits Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the X-inactivation centre (Xic).
How Xist spreads silencing on a 150-megabases scale is unclear. Here we generate 
high-resolution maps of Xist binding on the X chromosome across a developmental
time course using CHART-seq. In female cells undergoing XCI de novo, Xist follows
a two-step mechanism, initially targeting gene-rich islands before spreading to
intervening gene-poor domains. Xist is depleted from genes that escape XCI but
may concentrate near escapee boundaries. Xist binding is linearly proportional to
PRC2 density and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), indicating co-migration 
of Xist and PRC2. Interestingly, when Xist is acutely stripped off from the Xi in
post-XCI cells, Xist recovers quickly within both gene-rich and gene-poor domains
on a timescale of hours instead of days, indicating a previously primed Xi
chromatin state. We conclude that Xist spreading takes distinct stage-specific
forms. During initial establishment, Xist follows a two-step mechanism, but
during maintenance, Xist spreads rapidly to both gene-rich and gene-poor regions.

A primary cilium is a solitary, slender, non-motile protuberance of structured
microtubules (9+0) enclosed by plasma membrane. Housing components of the cell
division apparatus between cell divisions, primary cilia also serve as
specialized compartments for calcium signalling and hedgehog signalling pathways.
Specialized sensory cilia such as retinal photoreceptors and olfactory cilia use 
diverse ion channels. An ion current has been measured from primary cilia of
kidney cells, but the responsible genes have not been identified. The polycystin 
proteins (PC and PKD), identified in linkage studies of polycystic kidney
disease, are candidate channels divided into two structural classes:
11-transmembrane proteins (PKD1, PKD1L1 and PKD1L2) remarkable for a large
extracellular amino terminus of putative cell adhesion domains and a
G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site, and the 6-transmembrane channel
proteins (PKD2, PKD2L1 and PKD2L2; TRPPs). Evidence indicates that the PKD1
proteins associate with the PKD2 proteins via coiled-coil domains. Here we use a 
transgenic mouse in which only cilia express a fluorophore and use it to record
directly from primary cilia, and demonstrate that PKD1L1 and PKD2L1 form ion
channels at high densities in several cell types. In conjunction with an
accompanying manuscript, we show that the PKD1L1-PKD2L1 heteromeric channel
establishes the cilia as a unique calcium compartment within cells that modulates
established hedgehog pathways.

Primary cilia are solitary, non-motile extensions of the centriole found on
nearly all nucleated eukaryotic cells between cell divisions. Only ∼200-300 nm in
diameter and a few micrometres long, they are separated from the cytoplasm by the
ciliary neck and basal body. Often called sensory cilia, they are thought to
receive chemical and mechanical stimuli and initiate specific cellular signal
transduction pathways. When activated by a ligand, hedgehog pathway proteins,
such as GLI2 and smoothened (SMO), translocate from the cell into the cilium.
Mutations in primary ciliary proteins are associated with severe developmental
defects. The ionic conditions, permeability of the primary cilia membrane, and
effectiveness of the diffusion barriers between the cilia and cell body are
unknown. Here we show that cilia are a unique calcium compartment regulated by a 
heteromeric TRP channel, PKD1L1-PKD2L1, in mice and humans. In contrast to the
hypothesis that polycystin (PKD) channels initiate changes in ciliary calcium
that are conducted into the cytoplasm, we show that changes in ciliary calcium
concentration occur without substantially altering global cytoplasmic calcium.
PKD1L1-PKD2L1 acts as a ciliary calcium channel controlling ciliary calcium
concentration and thereby modifying SMO-activated GLI2 translocation and GLI1
expression.

Fibroblasts are the major mesenchymal cell type in connective tissue and deposit 
the collagen and elastic fibres of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Even within a 
single tissue, fibroblasts exhibit considerable functional diversity, but it is
not known whether this reflects the existence of a differentiation hierarchy or
is a response to different environmental factors. Here we show, using
transplantation assays and lineage tracing in mice, that the fibroblasts of skin 
connective tissue arise from two distinct lineages. One forms the upper dermis,
including the dermal papilla that regulates hair growth and the arrector pili
muscle, which controls piloerection. The other forms the lower dermis, including 
the reticular fibroblasts that synthesize the bulk of the fibrillar ECM, and the 
preadipocytes and adipocytes of the hypodermis. The upper lineage is required for
hair follicle formation. In wounded adult skin, the initial wave of dermal repair
is mediated by the lower lineage and upper dermal fibroblasts are recruited only 
during re-epithelialization. Epidermal β-catenin activation stimulates the
expansion of the upper dermal lineage, rendering wounds permissive for hair
follicle formation. Our findings explain why wounding is linked to formation of
ECM-rich scar tissue that lacks hair follicles. They also form a platform for
discovering fibroblast lineages in other tissues and for examining fibroblast
changes in ageing and disease.

Learning and memory processes can be influenced by recent experience, but the
mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Enhanced plasticity during critical
periods of early life is linked to differentiating parvalbumin (PV)-interneuron
networks, suggesting that recent experience may modulate learning by targeting
the differentiation state of PV neurons in the adult. Here we show that
environmental enrichment and Pavlovian contextual fear conditioning induce
opposite, sustained and reversible hippocampal PV-network configurations in adult
mice. Specifically, enrichment promotes the emergence of large fractions of
low-differentiation (low PV and GAD67 expression) basket cells with low
excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic-density ratios, whereas fear conditioning leads
to large fractions of high-differentiation (high PV and GAD67 expression) basket 
cells with high excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic-density ratios. Pharmacogenetic
inhibition or activation of PV neurons was sufficient to induce such opposite
low-PV-network or high-PV-network configurations, respectively. The
low-PV-network configuration enhanced structural synaptic plasticity, and memory 
consolidation and retrieval, whereas these were reduced by the high-PV-network
configuration. We then show that maze navigation learning induces a hippocampal
low-PV-network configuration paralleled by enhanced memory and structural
synaptic plasticity throughout training, followed by a shift to a high-PV-network
configuration after learning completion. The shift to a low-PV-network
configuration specifically involved increased vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
(VIP)-positive GABAergic boutons and synaptic transmission onto PV neurons.
Closely comparable low- and high-PV-network configurations involving VIP boutons 
were specifically induced in primary motor cortex upon rotarod motor learning.
These results uncover a network plasticity mechanism induced after learning
through VIP-PV microcircuit modulation, and involving large, sustained and
reversible shifts in the configuration of PV basket-cell networks in the adult.
This novel form of experience-related plasticity in the adult modulates memory
consolidation, retrieval and learning, and might be harnessed for therapeutic
strategies to promote cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection.

The increase in solar luminosity over geological timescales should warm the
Earth's climate, increasing water evaporation, which will in turn enhance the
atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical insolation, this
destabilizing greenhouse feedback can 'run away' until the oceans have completely
evaporated. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause
evaporative loss of the oceans to space before the runaway greenhouse state
occurs. The critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain
uncertain because they have so far been evaluated using one-dimensional models
that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key
stabilizing features of the Earth's climate. Here we use a three-dimensional
global climate model to show that the insolation threshold for the runaway
greenhouse state to occur is about 375 W m(-2), which is significantly higher
than previously thought. Our model is specifically developed to quantify the
climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and
extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that
clouds have a destabilizing feedback effect on the long-term warming. However,
subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a
stabilizing effect that is strong enough to shift the runaway greenhouse limit to
higher values of insolation than are inferred from one-dimensional models.
Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere 
remains sufficiently cold and dry to hamper the escape of atmospheric water, even
at large fluxes. This has strong implications for the possibility of liquid water
existing on Venus early in its history, and extends the size of the habitable
zone around other stars.

More than four decades ago, Brochard and de Gennes proposed that colloidal
suspensions of ferromagnetic particles in nematic (directionally ordered) liquid 
crystals could form macroscopic ferromagnetic phases at room temperature. The
experimental realization of these predicted phases has hitherto proved elusive,
with such systems showing enhanced paramagnetism but no spontaneous magnetization
in the absence of an external magnetic field. Here we show that nanometre-sized
ferromagnetic platelets suspended in a nematic liquid crystal can order
ferromagnetically on quenching from the isotropic phase. Cooling in the absence
of a magnetic field produces a polydomain sample exhibiting the two opposing
states of magnetization, oriented parallel to the direction of nematic ordering. 
Cooling in the presence of a magnetic field yields a monodomain sample;
magnetization can be switched by domain wall movement on reversal of the applied 
magnetic field. The ferromagnetic properties of this dipolar fluid are due to the
interplay of the nematic elastic interaction (which depends critically on the
shape of the particles) and the magnetic dipolar interaction. This ferromagnetic 
phase responds to very small magnetic fields and may find use in magneto-optic
devices.

The discovery of the Archaea and the proposal of the three-domains 'universal'
tree, based on ribosomal RNA and core genes mainly involved in protein
translation, catalysed new ideas for cellular evolution and eukaryotic origins.
However, accumulating evidence suggests that the three-domains tree may be
incorrect: evolutionary trees made using newer methods place eukaryotic core
genes within the Archaea, supporting hypotheses in which an archaeon participated
in eukaryotic origins by founding the host lineage for the mitochondrial
endosymbiont. These results provide support for only two primary domains of
life--Archaea and Bacteria--because eukaryotes arose through partnership between 
them.

To sustain neurotransmission, synaptic vesicles and their associated proteins
must be recycled locally at synapses. Synaptic vesicles are thought to be
regenerated approximately 20 s after fusion by the assembly of clathrin scaffolds
or in approximately 1 s by the reversal of fusion pores via 'kiss-and-run'
endocytosis. Here we use optogenetics to stimulate cultured hippocampal neurons
with a single stimulus, rapidly freeze them after fixed intervals and examine the
ultrastructure using electron microscopy--'flash-and-freeze' electron microscopy.
Docked vesicles fuse and collapse into the membrane within 30 ms of the stimulus.
Compensatory endocytosis occurs within 50 to 100 ms at sites flanking the active 
zone. Invagination is blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization, and scission
is blocked by inhibiting dynamin. Because intact synaptic vesicles are not
recovered, this form of recycling is not compatible with kiss-and-run
endocytosis; moreover, it is 200-fold faster than clathrin-mediated endocytosis. 
It is likely that 'ultrafast endocytosis' is specialized to restore the surface
area of the membrane rapidly.

Human GABA(B) (γ-aminobutyric acid class B) receptor is a G-protein-coupled
receptor central to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. It functions as an
obligatory heterodimer of the subunits GBR1 and GBR2. Here we present the crystal
structures of a heterodimeric complex between the extracellular domains of GBR1
and GBR2 in the apo, agonist-bound and antagonist-bound forms. The apo and
antagonist-bound structures represent the resting state of the receptor; the
agonist-bound complex corresponds to the active state. Both subunits adopt an
open conformation at rest, and only GBR1 closes on agonist-induced receptor
activation. The agonists and antagonists are anchored in the interdomain crevice 
of GBR1 by an overlapping set of residues. An antagonist confines GBR1 to the
open conformation of the inactive state, whereas an agonist induces its domain
closure for activation. Our data reveal a unique activation mechanism for GABA(B)
receptor that involves the formation of a novel heterodimer interface between
subunits.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a process in which
organelles termed autophagosomes deliver cytoplasmic constituents to lysosomes
for degradation. Autophagy has a major role in cellular homeostasis and has been 
implicated in various forms of human disease. The role of autophagy in cancer
seems to be complex, with reports indicating both pro-tumorigenic and
tumour-suppressive roles. Here we show, in a humanized genetically-modified mouse
model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), that autophagy's role in tumour
development is intrinsically connected to the status of the tumour suppressor
p53. Mice with pancreases containing an activated oncogenic allele of Kras (also 
called Ki-Ras)--the most common mutational event in PDAC--develop a small number 
of pre-cancerous lesions that stochastically develop into PDAC over time.
However, mice also lacking the essential autophagy genes Atg5 or Atg7 accumulate 
low-grade, pre-malignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, but
progression to high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias and PDAC is
blocked. In marked contrast, in mice containing oncogenic Kras and lacking p53,
loss of autophagy no longer blocks tumour progression, but actually accelerates
tumour onset, with metabolic analysis revealing enhanced glucose uptake and
enrichment of anabolic pathways, which can fuel tumour growth. These findings
provide considerable insight into the role of autophagy in cancer and have
important implications for autophagy inhibition in cancer therapy. In this
regard, we also show that treatment of mice with the autophagy inhibitor
hydroxychloroquine, which is currently being used in several clinical trials,
significantly accelerates tumour formation in mice containing oncogenic Kras but 
lacking p53.

CAAX proteins have essential roles in multiple signalling pathways, controlling
processes such as proliferation, differentiation and carcinogenesis. The ∼120
mammalian CAAX proteins function at cellular membranes and include the Ras
superfamily of small GTPases, nuclear lamins, the γ-subunit of heterotrimeric
GTPases, and several protein kinases and phosphatases. The proper localization of
CAAX proteins to cell membranes is orchestrated by a series of post-translational
modifications of the carboxy-terminal CAAX motifs (where C is cysteine, A is an
aliphatic amino acid and X is any amino acid). These reactions involve
prenylation of the cysteine residue, cleavage at the AAX tripeptide and
methylation of the carboxyl-prenylated cysteine residue. The major CAAX protease 
activity is mediated by Rce1 (Ras and a-factor converting enzyme 1), an
intramembrane protease (IMP) of the endoplasmic reticulum. Information on the
architecture and proteolytic mechanism of Rce1 has been lacking. Here we report
the crystal structure of a Methanococcus maripaludis homologue of Rce1, whose
endopeptidase specificity for farnesylated peptides mimics that of eukaryotic
Rce1. Its structure, comprising eight transmembrane α-helices, and catalytic site
are distinct from those of other IMPs. The catalytic residues are located ∼10 Å
into the membrane and are exposed to the cytoplasm and membrane through a conical
cavity that accommodates the prenylated CAAX substrate. We propose that the
farnesyl lipid binds to a site at the opening of two transmembrane α-helices,
which results in the scissile bond being positioned adjacent to a
glutamate-activated nucleophilic water molecule. This study suggests that Rce1 is
the founding member of a novel IMP family, the glutamate IMPs.

Achieving the goal of malaria elimination will depend on targeting Plasmodium
pathways essential across all life stages. Here we identify a lipid kinase,
phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase (PI(4)K), as the target of imidazopyrazines, a
new antimalarial compound class that inhibits the intracellular development of
multiple Plasmodium species at each stage of infection in the vertebrate host.
Imidazopyrazines demonstrate potent preventive, therapeutic, and
transmission-blocking activity in rodent malaria models, are active against
blood-stage field isolates of the major human pathogens P. falciparum and P.
vivax, and inhibit liver-stage hypnozoites in the simian parasite P. cynomolgi.
We show that imidazopyrazines exert their effect through inhibitory interaction
with the ATP-binding pocket of PI(4)K, altering the intracellular distribution of
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Collectively, our data define PI(4)K as a key
Plasmodium vulnerability, opening up new avenues of target-based discovery to
identify drugs with an ideal activity profile for the prevention, treatment and
elimination of malaria.

An increasing body of evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a
contributor to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as
Parkinson's disease. Recent studies of the Parkinson's disease associated genes
PINK1 (ref. 2) and parkin (PARK2, ref. 3) indicate that they may act in a quality
control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Here
we elucidate regulators that have an impact on parkin translocation to damaged
mitochondria with genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens coupled to
high-content microscopy. Screening yielded gene candidates involved in diverse
cellular processes that were subsequently validated in low-throughput assays.
This led to characterization of TOMM7 as essential for stabilizing PINK1 on the
outer mitochondrial membrane following mitochondrial damage. We also discovered
that HSPA1L (HSP70 family member) and BAG4 have mutually opposing roles in the
regulation of parkin translocation. The screens revealed that SIAH3, found to
localize to mitochondria, inhibits PINK1 accumulation after mitochondrial insult,
reducing parkin translocation. Overall, our screens provide a rich resource to
understand mitochondrial quality control.

Information theory establishes the ultimate limits on performance for noisy
communication systems. Accurate models of physical communication devices must
include quantum effects, but these typically make the theory intractable. As a
result, communication capacities--the maximum possible rates of data
transmission--are not known, even for transmission between two users connected by
an electromagnetic waveguide with Gaussian noise. Here we present an exactly
solvable model of communication with a fully quantum electromagnetic field. This 
gives explicit expressions for all point-to-point capacities of noisy quantum
channels, with implications for quantum key distribution and fibre-optic
communications. We also develop a theory of quantum communication networks by
solving some rudimentary models including broadcast and multiple-access channels.
We compare the predictions of our model with the orthodox Gaussian model and in
all cases find agreement to within a few bits. At high signal-to-noise ratios,
our simple model captures the relevant physics while remaining amenable to exact 
solution.

Accreting black holes are known to power relativistic jets, both in stellar-mass 
binary systems and at the centres of galaxies. The power carried away by the
jets, and, hence, the feedback they provide to their surroundings, depends
strongly on their composition. Jets containing a baryonic component should carry 
significantly more energy than electron-positron jets. Energetic considerations
and circular-polarization measurements have provided conflicting circumstantial
evidence for the presence or absence of baryons in jets, and the only system in
which they have been unequivocally detected is the peculiar X-ray binary SS 433
(refs 4, 5). Here we report the detection of Doppler-shifted X-ray emission lines
from a more typical black-hole candidate X-ray binary, 4U 1630-47, coincident
with the reappearance of radio emission from the jets of the source. We argue
that these lines arise from baryonic matter in a jet travelling at approximately 
two-thirds the speed of light, thereby establishing the presence of baryons in
the jet. Such baryonic jets are more likely to be powered by the accretion disk
than by the spin of the black hole, and if the baryons can be accelerated to
relativistic speeds, the jets should be strong sources of γ-rays and neutrino
emission.

In multicellular organisms, transcription regulation is one of the central
mechanisms modelling lineage differentiation and cell-fate determination.
Transcription requires dynamic chromatin configurations between promoters and
their corresponding distal regulatory elements. It is believed that their
communication occurs within large discrete foci of aggregated RNA polymerases
termed transcription factories in three-dimensional nuclear space. However, the
dynamic nature of chromatin connectivity has not been characterized at the
genome-wide level. Here, through a chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end
tagging approach using an antibody that primarily recognizes the pre-initiation
complexes of RNA polymerase II, we explore the transcriptional interactomes of
three mouse cells of progressive lineage commitment, including pluripotent
embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells and neurosphere stem/progenitor cells.
Our global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately 40,000 long-range
interactions, suggest precise enhancer-promoter associations and delineate
cell-type-specific chromatin structures. Analysis of the complex regulatory
repertoire shows that there are extensive colocalizations among promoters and
distal-acting enhancers. Most of the enhancers associate with promoters located
beyond their nearest active genes, indicating that the linear juxtaposition is
not the only guiding principle driving enhancer target selection. Although
promoter-enhancer interactions exhibit high cell-type specificity, promoters
involved in interactions are found to be generally common and mostly active among
different cells. Chromatin connectivity networks reveal that the pivotal genes of
reprogramming functions are transcribed within physical proximity to each other
in embryonic stem cells, linking chromatin architecture to coordinated gene
expression. Our study sets the stage for the full-scale dissection of spatial and
temporal genome structures and their roles in orchestrating development.

Bacteria swim by means of long flagella extending from the cell surface. These
are assembled from thousands of protein subunits translocated across the cell
membrane by an export machinery at the base of each flagellum. Unfolded subunits 
then transit through a narrow channel at the core of the growing flagellum to the
tip, where they crystallize into the nascent structure. As the flagellum
lengthens outside the cell, the rate of flagellum growth does not change. The
mystery is how subunit transit is maintained at a constant rate without a
discernible energy source in the channel of the external flagellum. We present
evidence for a simple physical mechanism for flagellum growth that harnesses the 
entropic force of the unfolded subunits themselves. We show that a subunit docked
at the export machinery can be captured by a free subunit through head-to-tail
linkage of juxtaposed amino (N)- and carboxy (C)-terminal helices. We propose
that sequential rounds of linkage would generate a multisubunit chain that pulls 
successive subunits into and through the channel to the flagellum tip, and by
isolating filaments growing on bacterial cells we reveal the predicted chain of
head-to-tail linked subunits in the transit channel of flagella. Thermodynamic
analysis confirms that links in the subunit chain can withstand the pulling force
generated by rounds of subunit crystallization at the flagellum tip, and polymer 
theory predicts that as the N terminus of each unfolded subunit crystallizes, the
entropic force at the subunit C terminus would increase, rapidly overcoming the
threshold required to pull the next subunit from the export machinery. This
pulling force would adjust automatically over the increasing length of the
growing flagellum, maintaining a constant rate of subunit delivery to the tip.

Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are isolated from the inner cell mass of
blastocysts, and can be preserved in vitro in a naive inner-cell-mass-like
configuration by providing exogenous stimulation with leukaemia inhibitory factor
(LIF) and small molecule inhibition of ERK1/ERK2 and GSK3β signalling (termed
2i/LIF conditions). Hallmarks of naive pluripotency include driving Oct4 (also
known as Pou5f1) transcription by its distal enhancer, retaining a
pre-inactivation X chromosome state, and global reduction in DNA methylation and 
in H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark deposition on developmental regulatory gene
promoters. Upon withdrawal of 2i/LIF, naive mouse ES cells can drift towards a
primed pluripotent state resembling that of the post-implantation epiblast.
Although human ES cells share several molecular features with naive mouse ES
cells, they also share a variety of epigenetic properties with primed murine
epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). These include predominant use of the proximal
enhancer element to maintain OCT4 expression, pronounced tendency for X
chromosome inactivation in most female human ES cells, increase in DNA
methylation and prominent deposition of H3K27me3 and bivalent domain acquisition 
on lineage regulatory genes. The feasibility of establishing human ground state
naive pluripotency in vitro with equivalent molecular and functional features to 
those characterized in mouse ES cells remains to be defined. Here we establish
defined conditions that facilitate the derivation of genetically unmodified human
naive pluripotent stem cells from already established primed human ES cells, from
somatic cells through induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming or
directly from blastocysts. The novel naive pluripotent cells validated herein
retain molecular characteristics and functional properties that are highly
similar to mouse naive ES cells, and distinct from conventional primed human
pluripotent cells. This includes competence in the generation of cross-species
chimaeric mouse embryos that underwent organogenesis following microinjection of 
human naive iPS cells into mouse morulas. Collectively, our findings establish
new avenues for regenerative medicine, patient-specific iPS cell disease
modelling and the study of early human development in vitro and in vivo.

Foundering of lower island-arc crust as an explanation for the origin of the
continental Moho.

A long-standing theory for the genesis of continental crust is that it is formed 
in subduction zones. However, the observed seismic properties of lower crust and 
upper mantle in oceanic island arcs differ significantly from those in the
continental crust. Accordingly, significant modifications of lower arc crust must
occur, if continental crust is indeed formed from island arcs. Here we
investigate how the seismic characteristics of arc crust are transformed into
those of the continental crust by calculating the density and seismic structure
of two exposed sections of island arc (Kohistan and Talkeetna). The Kohistan
crustal section is negatively buoyant with respect to the underlying depleted
upper mantle at depths exceeding 40 kilometres and is characterized by a steady
increase in seismic velocity similar to that observed in active arcs. In
contrast, the lower Talkeetna crust is density sorted, preserving only relicts
(about ten to a hundred metres thick) of rock with density exceeding that of the 
underlying mantle. Specifically, the foundering of the lower Talkeetna crust
resulted in the replacement of dense mafic and ultramafic cumulates by residual
upper mantle, producing a sharp seismic discontinuity at depths of around 38 to
42 kilometres, characteristic of the continental Mohorovičić discontinuity (the
Moho). Dynamic calculations indicate that foundering is an episodic process that 
occurs in most arcs with a periodicity of half a million to five million years.
Moreover, because foundering will continue after arc magmatism ceases, this
process ultimately results in the formation of the continental Moho.

After the initial burst of γ-rays that defines a γ-ray burst (GRB), expanding
ejecta collide with the circumburst medium and begin to decelerate at the onset
of the afterglow, during which a forward shock travels outwards and a reverse
shock propagates backwards into the oncoming collimated flow, or 'jet'. Light
from the reverse shock should be highly polarized if the jet's magnetic field is 
globally ordered and advected from the central engine, with a position angle that
is predicted to remain stable in magnetized baryonic jet models or vary randomly 
with time if the field is produced locally by plasma or magnetohydrodynamic
instabilities. Degrees of linear polarization of P ≈ 10 per cent in the optical
band have previously been detected in the early afterglow, but the lack of
temporal measurements prevented definitive tests of competing jet models. Hours
to days after the γ-ray burst, polarization levels are low (P < 4 per cent), when
emission from the shocked ambient medium dominates. Here we report the detection 
of P =28(+4)(-4) per cent in the immediate afterglow of Swift γ-ray burst
GRB 120308A, four minutes after its discovery in the γ-ray band, decreasing to P 
= 16(+5)(-4) per cent over the subsequent ten minutes. The polarization position 
angle remains stable, changing by no more than 15 degrees over this time, with a 
possible trend suggesting gradual rotation and ruling out plasma or
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. Instead, the polarization properties show that
GRBs contain magnetized baryonic jets with large-scale uniform fields that can
survive long after the initial explosion.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are polymodal signal detectors that
respond to a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli. Elucidating how these
channels integrate and convert physiological signals into channel opening is
essential to understanding how they regulate cell excitability under normal and
pathophysiological conditions. Here we exploit pharmacological probes (a peptide 
toxin and small vanilloid agonists) to determine structures of two activated
states of the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1. A domain (consisting of transmembrane
segments 1-4) that moves during activation of voltage-gated channels remains
stationary in TRPV1, highlighting differences in gating mechanisms for these
structurally related channel superfamilies. TRPV1 opening is associated with
major structural rearrangements in the outer pore, including the pore helix and
selectivity filter, as well as pronounced dilation of a hydrophobic constriction 
at the lower gate, suggesting a dual gating mechanism. Allosteric coupling
between upper and lower gates may account for rich physiological modulation
exhibited by TRPV1 and other TRP channels.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are sensors for a wide range of
cellular and environmental signals, but elucidating how these channels respond to
physical and chemical stimuli has been hampered by a lack of detailed structural 
information. Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine
the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4 Å resolution, breaking
the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. 
Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central
ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5-6 (S5-S6) and the intervening pore
loop, which is flanked by S1-S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide
extracellular 'mouth' with a short selectivity filter. The conserved 'TRP domain'
interacts with the S4-S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric
modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic
domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a
structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.

Sudden beaching of huge seaweed masses smother the coastline and form rotting
piles on the shore. The number of reports of these events in previously
unaffected areas has increased worldwide in recent years. These 'seaweed tides'
can harm tourism-based economies, smother aquaculture operations or disrupt
traditional artisanal fisheries. Coastal eutrophication is the obvious, ultimate 
explanation for the increase in seaweed biomass, but the proximate processes that
are responsible for individual beaching events are complex and require dedicated 
study to develop effective mitigation strategies. Harvesting the macroalgae, a
valuable raw material, before they beach could well be developed into an
effective solution.

The risk of flood disasters is increasing for many coastal societies owing to
global and regional changes in climate conditions, sea-level rise, land
subsidence and sediment supply. At the same time, in many locations, conventional
coastal engineering solutions such as sea walls are increasingly challenged by
these changes and their maintenance may become unsustainable. We argue that flood
protection by ecosystem creation and restoration can provide a more sustainable, 
cost-effective and ecologically sound alternative to conventional coastal
engineering and that, in suitable locations, it should be implemented globally
and on a large scale.

The flow of terrestrial groundwater to the sea is an important natural component 
of the hydrological cycle. This process, however, does not explain the large
volumes of low-salinity groundwater that are found below continental shelves.
There is mounting evidence for the global occurrence of offshore fresh and
brackish groundwater reserves. The potential use of these non-renewable reserves 
as a freshwater resource provides a clear incentive for future research. But the 
scope for continental shelf hydrogeology is broader and we envisage that it can
contribute to the advancement of other scientific disciplines, in particular
sedimentology and marine geochemistry.

The carbon cycle of the coastal ocean is a dynamic component of the global carbon
budget. But the diverse sources and sinks of carbon and their complex
interactions in these waters remain poorly understood. Here we discuss the
sources, exchanges and fates of carbon in the coastal ocean and how anthropogenic
activities have altered the carbon cycle. Recent evidence suggests that the
coastal ocean may have become a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide during
post-industrial times. Continued human pressures in coastal zones will probably
have an important impact on the future evolution of the coastal ocean's carbon
budget.

Coastal populations and wetlands have been intertwined for centuries, whereby
humans both influence and depend on the extensive ecosystem services that
wetlands provide. Although coastal wetlands have long been considered vulnerable 
to sea-level rise, recent work has identified fascinating feedbacks between plant
growth and geomorphology that allow wetlands to actively resist the deleterious
effects of sea-level rise. Humans alter the strength of these feedbacks by
changing the climate, nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates.
Whether wetlands continue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on how human 
impacts interact with rapid sea-level rise, and socio-economic factors that
influence transgression into adjacent uplands.

Coastal flooding by tropical cyclones and sea-level rise.

Woodruff JD(1), Irish JL, Camargo SJ.

Author information:

01003, USA.

The future impacts of climate change on landfalling tropical cyclones are
unclear. Regardless of this uncertainty, flooding by tropical cyclones will
increase as a result of accelerated sea-level rise. Under similar rates of rapid 
sea-level rise during the early Holocene epoch most low-lying sedimentary
coastlines were generally much less resilient to storm impacts. Society must
learn to live with a rapidly evolving shoreline that is increasingly prone to
flooding from tropical cyclones. These impacts can be mitigated partly with
adaptive strategies, which include careful stewardship of sediments and
reductions in human-induced land subsidence.

Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over the past two decades,
contributing a quarter of the observed global sea-level rise. Increased submarine
melting is thought to have triggered the retreat of Greenland's outlet glaciers, 
which is partly responsible for the ice loss. However, the chain of events and
physical processes remain elusive. Recent evidence suggests that an anomalous
inflow of subtropical waters driven by atmospheric changes, multidecadal natural 
ocean variability and a long-term increase in the North Atlantic's upper ocean
heat content since the 1950s all contributed to a warming of the subpolar North
Atlantic. This led, in conjunction with increased runoff, to enhanced submarine
glacier melting. Future climate projections raise the potential for continued
increases in warming and ice-mass loss, with implications for sea level and
climate.

'Pre-leukaemic' mutations are thought to promote clonal expansion of
haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by increasing self-renewal and competitiveness; 
however, mutations that increase HSC proliferation tend to reduce competitiveness
and self-renewal potential, raising the question of how a mutant HSC can
sustainably outcompete wild-type HSCs. Activating mutations in NRAS are prevalent
in human myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukaemia. Here we show that a single
allele of oncogenic Nras(G12D) increases HSC proliferation but also increases
reconstituting and self-renewal potential upon serial transplantation in
irradiated mice, all prior to leukaemia initiation. Nras(G12D) also confers
long-term self-renewal potential to multipotent progenitors. To explore the
mechanism by which Nras(G12D) promotes HSC proliferation and self-renewal, we
assessed cell-cycle kinetics using H2B-GFP label retention and
5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Nras(G12D) had a bimodal effect on
HSCs, increasing the frequency with which some HSCs divide and reducing the
frequency with which others divide. This mirrored bimodal effects on
reconstituting potential, as rarely dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs outcompeted
wild-type HSCs, whereas frequently dividing Nras(G12D) HSCs did not. Nras(G12D)
caused these effects by promoting STAT5 signalling, inducing different
transcriptional responses in different subsets of HSCs. One signal can therefore 
increase HSC proliferation, competitiveness and self-renewal through bimodal
effects on HSC gene expression, cycling and reconstituting potential.

Despite recent advances in crystallography and the availability of
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structures, little is known about the mechanism
of their activation process, as only the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and
rhodopsin have been crystallized in fully active conformations. Here we report
the structure of an agonist-bound, active state of the human M2 muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor stabilized by a G-protein mimetic camelid antibody
fragment isolated by conformational selection using yeast surface display. In
addition to the expected changes in the intracellular surface, the structure
reveals larger conformational changes in the extracellular region and orthosteric
binding site than observed in the active states of the β2AR and rhodopsin. We
also report the structure of the M2 receptor simultaneously bound to the
orthosteric agonist iperoxo and the positive allosteric modulator LY2119620. This
structure reveals that LY2119620 recognizes a largely pre-formed binding site in 
the extracellular vestibule of the iperoxo-bound receptor, inducing a slight
contraction of this outer binding pocket. These structures offer important
insights into the activation mechanism and allosteric modulation of muscarinic
receptors.

The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's most prominent source of
interannual climate variability, exerting profound worldwide effects. Despite
decades of research, its behaviour continues to challenge scientists. In the
eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, the anomalously cool sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) found during La Niña events and the warm waters of modest El Niño events
both propagate westwards, as in the seasonal cycle. In contrast, SST anomalies
propagate eastwards during extreme El Niño events, prominently in the post-1976
period, spurring unusual weather events worldwide with costly consequences. The
cause of this propagation asymmetry is currently unknown. Here we trace the cause
of the asymmetry to the variations in upper ocean currents in the equatorial
Pacific, whereby the westward-flowing currents are enhanced during La Niña events
but reversed during extreme El Niño events. Our results highlight that
propagation asymmetry is favoured when the westward mean equatorial currents
weaken, as is projected to be the case under global warming. By analysing past
and future climate simulations of an ensemble of models with more realistic
propagation, we find a doubling in the occurrences of El Niño events that feature
prominent eastward propagation characteristics in a warmer world. Our analysis
thus suggests that more frequent emergence of propagation asymmetry will be an
indication of the Earth's warming climate.

Jasmonates are ubiquitous oxylipin-derived phytohormones that are essential in
the regulation of many development, growth and defence processes. Across the
plant kingdom, jasmonates act as elicitors of the production of bioactive
secondary metabolites that serve in defence against attackers. Knowledge of the
conserved jasmonate perception and early signalling machineries is increasing,
but the downstream mechanisms that regulate defence metabolism remain largely
unknown. Here we show that, in the legume Medicago truncatula, jasmonate recruits
the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) quality control system to
manage the production of triterpene saponins, widespread bioactive compounds that
share a biogenic origin with sterols. An ERAD-type RING membrane-anchor E3
ubiquitin ligase is co-expressed with saponin synthesis enzymes to control the
activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting
enzyme in the supply of the ubiquitous terpene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate.
Thus, unrestrained bioactive saponin accumulation is prevented and plant
development and integrity secured. This control apparatus is equivalent to the
ERAD system that regulates sterol synthesis in yeasts and mammals but that uses
distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, of the HMGR degradation 1 (HRD1) type, to direct
destruction of HMGR. Hence, the general principles for the management of sterol
and triterpene saponin biosynthesis are conserved across eukaryotes but can be
controlled by divergent regulatory cues.

Newborn infants are highly susceptible to infection. This defect in host defence 
has generally been ascribed to the immaturity of neonatal immune cells; however, 
the degree of hyporesponsiveness is highly variable and depends on the
stimulation conditions. These discordant responses illustrate the need for a more
unified explanation for why immunity is compromised in neonates. Here we show
that physiologically enriched CD71(+) erythroid cells in neonatal mice and human 
cord blood have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. The production of
innate immune protective cytokines by adult cells is diminished after transfer to
neonatal mice or after co-culture with neonatal splenocytes. Neonatal CD71(+)
cells express the enzyme arginase-2, and arginase activity is essential for the
immunosuppressive properties of these cells because molecular inhibition of this 
enzyme or supplementation with L-arginine overrides immunosuppression. In
addition, the ablation of CD71(+) cells in neonatal mice, or the decline in
number of these cells as postnatal development progresses parallels the loss of
suppression, and restored resistance to the perinatal pathogens Listeria
monocytogenes and Escherichia coli. However, CD71(+) cell-mediated susceptibility
to infection is counterbalanced by CD71(+) cell-mediated protection against
aberrant immune cell activation in the intestine, where colonization with
commensal microorganisms occurs swiftly after parturition. Conversely,
circumventing such colonization by using antimicrobials or gnotobiotic germ-free 
mice overrides these protective benefits. Thus, CD71(+) cells quench the
excessive inflammation induced by abrupt colonization with commensal
microorganisms after parturition. This finding challenges the idea that the
susceptibility of neonates to infection reflects immune-cell-intrinsic defects
and instead highlights processes that are developmentally more essential and
inadvertently mitigate innate immune protection. We anticipate that these results
will spark renewed investigation into the need for immunosuppression in neonates,
as well as improved strategies for augmenting host defence in this vulnerable
population.

Genetic incompatibilities are widespread within species.

The importance of epistasis--non-additive interactions between alleles--in
shaping population fitness has long been a controversial topic, hampered in part 
by lack of empirical evidence. Traditionally, epistasis is inferred on the basis 
of non-independence of genotypic values between loci for a given trait. However, 
epistasis for fitness should also have a genomic footprint. To capture this
signal, we have developed a simple approach that relies on detecting genotype
ratio distortion as a sign of epistasis, and we apply this method to a large
panel of Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines. Here we confirm
experimentally that instances of genotype ratio distortion represent loci with
epistatic fitness effects; we conservatively estimate that any two haploid
genomes in this study are expected to harbour 1.15 pairs of epistatically
interacting alleles. This observation has important implications for speciation
genetics, as it indicates that the raw material to drive reproductive isolation
is segregating contemporaneously within species and does not necessarily require,
as proposed by the Dobzhansky-Muller model, the emergence of incompatible
mutations independently derived and fixed in allopatry. The relevance of our
result extends beyond speciation, as it demonstrates that epistasis is widespread
but that it may often go undetected owing to lack of statistical power or lack of
genome-wide scope of the experiments.

Olivine is a major component of the mantle of differentiated bodies, including
Earth. Howardite, eucrite and diogenite (HED) meteorites represent regolith,
basaltic-crust, lower-crust and possibly ultramafic-mantle samples of asteroid
Vesta, which is the lone surviving, large, differentiated, basaltic rocky
protoplanet in the Solar System. Only a few of these meteorites, the
orthopyroxene-rich diogenites, contain olivine, typically with a concentration of
less than 25 per cent by volume. Olivine was tentatively identified on Vesta, on 
the basis of spectral and colour data, but other observations did not confirm its
presence. Here we report that olivine is indeed present locally on Vesta's
surface but that, unexpectedly, it has not been found within the deep, south-pole
basins, which are thought to be excavated mantle rocks. Instead, it occurs as
near-surface materials in the northern hemisphere. Unlike the meteorites, the
olivine-rich (more than 50 per cent by volume) material is not associated with
diogenite but seems to be mixed with howardite, the most common surface material.
Olivine is exposed in crater walls and in ejecta scattered diffusely over a broad
area. The size of the olivine exposures and the absence of associated diogenite
favour a mantle source, but the exposures are located far from the deep impact
basins. The amount and distribution of observed olivine-rich material suggest a
complex evolutionary history for Vesta.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat as a
defence against hypothermia and obesity. Current evidence indicates that brown
adipocytes arise from Myf5(+) dermotomal precursors through the action of PR
domain containing protein 16 (PRDM16) transcriptional complex. However, the
enzymatic component of the molecular switch that determines lineage specification
of brown adipocytes remains unknown. Here we show that euchromatic histone-lysine
N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) is an essential BAT-enriched lysine
methyltransferase in the PRDM16 transcriptional complex and controls brown
adipose cell fate. Loss of EHMT1 in brown adipocytes causes a severe loss of
brown fat characteristics and induces muscle differentiation in vivo through
demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and 3) of the muscle-selective gene 
promoters. Conversely, EHMT1 expression positively regulates the BAT-selective
thermogenic program by stabilizing the PRDM16 protein. Notably, adipose-specific 
deletion of EHMT1 leads to a marked reduction of BAT-mediated adaptive
thermogenesis, obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data indicate that 
EHMT1 is an essential enzymatic switch that controls brown adipose cell fate and 
energy homeostasis.

The development and severity of inflammatory bowel diseases and other chronic
inflammatory conditions can be influenced by host genetic and environmental
factors, including signals derived from commensal bacteria. However, the
mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we
demonstrate that mice with an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion 
of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3(ΔIEC) mice)
exhibited extensive dysregulation of IEC-intrinsic gene expression, including
decreased basal expression of genes associated with antimicrobial defence.
Critically, conventionally housed HDAC3(ΔIEC) mice demonstrated loss of Paneth
cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal
commensal bacteria. In addition, HDAC3(ΔIEC) mice showed significantly increased 
susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial 
expression of HDAC3 has a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis.
Re-derivation of HDAC3(ΔIEC) mice into germ-free conditions revealed that
dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis and intestinal barrier 
function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria. Although the
specific mechanisms through which IEC-intrinsic HDAC3 expression regulates these 
complex phenotypes remain to be determined, these data indicate that HDAC3 is a
critical factor that integrates commensal-bacteria-derived signals to calibrate
epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host-commensal
relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis.

Malignant melanomas harbouring point mutations (Val600Glu) in the
serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) depend on RAF-MEK-ERK
signalling for tumour cell growth. RAF and MEK inhibitors show remarkable
clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma; however, resistance to these agents
remains a formidable challenge. Global characterization of resistance mechanisms 
may inform the development of more effective therapeutic combinations. Here we
carried out systematic gain-of-function resistance studies by expressing more
than 15,500 genes individually in a BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell line treated with
RAF, MEK, ERK or combined RAF-MEK inhibitors. These studies revealed a
cyclic-AMP-dependent melanocytic signalling network not previously associated
with drug resistance, including G-protein-coupled receptors, adenyl cyclase,
protein kinase A and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Preliminary
analysis of biopsies from BRAF(V600E) melanoma patients revealed that
phosphorylated (active) CREB was suppressed by RAF-MEK inhibition but restored in
relapsing tumours. Expression of transcription factors activated downstream of
MAP kinase and cAMP pathways also conferred resistance, including c-FOS, NR4A1,
NR4A2 and MITF. Combined treatment with MAPK-pathway and histone-deacetylase
inhibitors suppressed MITF expression and cAMP-mediated resistance. Collectively,
these data suggest that oncogenic dysregulation of a melanocyte lineage
dependency can cause resistance to RAF-MEK-ERK inhibition, which may be overcome 
by combining signalling- and chromatin-directed therapeutics.

Members of the CD36 superfamily of scavenger receptor proteins are important
regulators of lipid metabolism and innate immunity. They recognize normal and
modified lipoproteins, as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The
family consists of three members: SR-BI (which delivers cholesterol to the liver 
and steroidogenic organs and is a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus),
LIMP-2/LGP85 (which mediates lysosomal delivery of β-glucocerebrosidase and
serves as a receptor for enterovirus 71 and coxsackieviruses) and CD36 (a
fatty-acid transporter and receptor for phagocytosis of effete cells and
Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes). Notably, CD36 is also a receptor for modified 
lipoproteins and β-amyloid, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis and of Alzheimer's disease. Despite their prominent roles in
health and disease, understanding the function and abnormalities of the CD36
family members has been hampered by the paucity of information about their
structure. Here we determine the crystal structure of LIMP-2 and infer, by
homology modelling, the structure of SR-BI and CD36. LIMP-2 shows a helical
bundle where β-glucocerebrosidase binds, and where ligands are most likely to
bind to SR-BI and CD36. Remarkably, the crystal structure also shows the
existence of a large cavity that traverses the entire length of the molecule.
Mutagenesis of SR-BI indicates that the cavity serves as a tunnel through which
cholesterol(esters) are delivered from the bound lipoprotein to the outer leaflet
of the plasma membrane. We provide evidence supporting a model whereby lipidic
constituents of the ligands attached to the receptor surface are handed off to
the membrane through the tunnel, accounting for the selective lipid transfer
characteristic of SR-BI and CD36.

Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins represent a large family of
sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that are involved in multiple aspects of
RNA metabolism. PPR proteins, which are found in exceptionally large numbers in
the mitochondria and chloroplasts of terrestrial plants, recognize
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in a modular fashion. The maize chloroplast protein
PPR10 binds to two similar RNA sequences from the ATPI-ATPH and PSAJ-RPL33
intergenic regions, referred to as ATPH and PSAJ, respectively. By protecting the
target RNA elements from 5' or 3' exonucleases, PPR10 defines the corresponding
5' and 3' messenger RNA termini. Despite rigorous functional characterizations,
the structural basis of sequence-specific ssRNA recognition by PPR proteins
remains to be elucidated. Here we report the crystal structures of PPR10 in
RNA-free and RNA-bound states at resolutions of 2.85 and 2.45 Å, respectively. In
the absence of RNA binding, the nineteen repeats of PPR10 are assembled into a
right-handed superhelical spiral. PPR10 forms an antiparallel, intertwined
homodimer and exhibits considerable conformational changes upon binding to its
target ssRNA, an 18-nucleotide PSAJ element. Six nucleotides of PSAJ are
specifically recognized by six corresponding PPR10 repeats following the
predicted code. The molecular basis for the specific and modular recognition of
RNA bases A, G and U is revealed. The structural elucidation of RNA recognition
by PPR proteins provides an important framework for potential biotechnological
applications of PPR proteins in RNA-related research areas.

There are two proposed explanations for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with
luminosities in excess of 10(39) erg s(-1). They could be intermediate-mass black
holes (more than 100-1,000 solar masses, M sun symbol) radiating at sub-maximal
(sub-Eddington) rates, as in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries but with larger, 
cooler accretion disks. Alternatively, they could be stellar-mass black holes
radiating at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. On its discovery, M 101 ULX-1
had a luminosity of 3 × 10(39) erg s(-1) and a supersoft thermal disk spectrum
with an exceptionally low temperature--uncomplicated by photons energized by a
corona of hot electrons--more consistent with the expected appearance of an
accreting intermediate-mass black hole. Here we report optical spectroscopic
monitoring of M 101 ULX-1. We confirm the previous suggestion that the system
contains a Wolf-Rayet star, and reveal that the orbital period is 8.2 days. The
black hole has a minimum mass of 5 M sun symbol, and more probably a mass of 20 M
sun symbol-30 M sun symbol, but we argue that it is very unlikely to be an
intermediate-mass black hole. Therefore, its exceptionally soft spectra at high
Eddington ratios violate the expectations for accretion onto stellar-mass black
holes. Accretion must occur from captured stellar wind, which has hitherto been
thought to be so inefficient that it could not power an ultraluminous source.

Genetically identical cells sharing an environment can display markedly different
phenotypes. It is often unclear how much of this variation derives from chance,
external signals, or attempts by individual cells to exert autonomous phenotypic 
programs. By observing thousands of cells for hundreds of consecutive generations
under constant conditions, we dissect the stochastic decision between a solitary,
motile state and a chained, sessile state in Bacillus subtilis. We show that the 
motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time
spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is
tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the
multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing 
the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are
genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway
triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial
commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend.

Somatic mutations in the small GTPase K-Ras are the most common activating
lesions found in human cancer, and are generally associated with poor response to
standard therapies. Efforts to target this oncogene directly have faced
difficulties owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and the absence of known
allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional activation 
of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis. With diminished regulation by
GTPase activity, the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative
nucleotide affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP and
increases the proportion of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development 
of small molecules that irreversibly bind to a common oncogenic mutant,
K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine for binding and
therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic studies reveal
the formation of a new pocket that is not apparent in previous structures of Ras,
beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to
K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and switch-II, subverting the native
nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing binding to Raf. Our
data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory site on
Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner.

The ancient cratered terrain of the southern highlands of Mars is thought to hold
clues to the planet's early differentiation, but until now no meteoritic regolith
breccias have been recovered from Mars. Here we show that the meteorite Northwest
Africa (NWA) 7533 (paired with meteorite NWA 7034) is a polymict breccia
consisting of a fine-grained interclast matrix containing clasts of
igneous-textured rocks and fine-grained clast-laden impact melt rocks. High
abundances of meteoritic siderophiles (for example nickel and iridium) found
throughout the rock reach a level in the fine-grained portions equivalent to 5
per cent CI chondritic input, which is comparable to the highest levels found in 
lunar breccias. Furthermore, analyses of three leucocratic monzonite clasts show 
a correlation between nickel, iridium and magnesium consistent with
differentiation from impact melts. Compositionally, all the fine-grained material
is alkalic basalt, chemically identical (except for sulphur, chlorine and zinc)
to soils from Gusev crater. Thus, we propose that NWA 7533 is a Martian regolith 
breccia. It contains zircons for which we measured an age of 4,428 ± 25 million
years, which were later disturbed 1,712 ± 85 million years ago. This evidence for
early crustal differentiation implies that the Martian crust, and its volatile
inventory, formed in about the first 100 million years of Martian history, coeval
with earliest crust formation on the Moon and the Earth. In addition,
incompatible element abundances in clast-laden impact melt rocks and interclast
matrix provide a geochemical estimate of the average thickness of the Martian
crust (50 kilometres) comparable to that estimated geophysically.

Returning native species to habitats degraded by biological invasions is a
critical conservation goal. A leading hypothesis poses that exotic plant
dominance is self-reinforced by impacts on ecosystem processes, leading to
persistent stable states. Invaders have been documented to modify fire regimes,
alter soil nutrients or shift microbial communities in ways that feed back to
benefit themselves over competitors. However, few studies have followed invasions
through time to ask whether ecosystem impacts and feedbacks persist. Here we
return to woodland sites in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park that were invaded by 
exotic C4 grasses in the 1960s, the ecosystem impacts of which were studied
intensively in the 1990s. We show that positive feedbacks between exotic grasses 
and soil nitrogen cycling have broken down, but rather than facilitating native
vegetation, the weakening feedbacks facilitate new exotic species. Data from the 
1990s showed that exotic grasses increased nitrogen-mineralization rates by two- 
to fourfold, but were nitrogen-limited. Thus, the impacts of the invader created 
a positive feedback early in the invasion. We now show that annual net soil
nitrogen mineralization has since dropped to pre-invasion levels. In addition, a 
seedling outplanting experiment that varied soil nitrogen and grass competition
demonstrates that the changing impacts of grasses do not favour native species
re-establishment. Instead, decreased nitrogen availability most benefits another 
aggressive invader, the nitrogen-fixing tree Morella faya. Long-term studies of
invasions may reveal that ecosystem impacts and feedbacks shift over time, but
that this may not benefit native species recovery.

Ferroelectrics have recently attracted attention as a candidate class of
materials for use in photovoltaic devices, and for the coupling of light
absorption with other functional properties. In these materials, the strong
inversion symmetry breaking that is due to spontaneous electric polarization
promotes the desirable separation of photo-excited carriers and allows voltages
higher than the bandgap, which may enable efficiencies beyond the maximum
possible in a conventional p-n junction solar cell. Ferroelectric oxides are also
stable in a wide range of mechanical, chemical and thermal conditions and can be 
fabricated using low-cost methods such as sol-gel thin-film deposition and
sputtering. Recent work has shown how a decrease in ferroelectric layer thickness
and judicious engineering of domain structures and ferroelectric-electrode
interfaces can greatly increase the current harvested from ferroelectric absorber
materials, increasing the power conversion efficiency from about 10(-4) to about 
0.5 per cent. Further improvements in photovoltaic efficiency have been inhibited
by the wide bandgaps (2.7-4 electronvolts) of ferroelectric oxides, which allow
the use of only 8-20 per cent of the solar spectrum. Here we describe a family of
single-phase solid oxide solutions made from low-cost and non-toxic elements
using conventional solid-state methods: [KNbO3]1 - x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3 - δ]x
(KBNNO). These oxides exhibit both ferroelectricity and a wide variation of
direct bandgaps in the range 1.1-3.8 electronvolts. In particular, the x = 0.1
composition is polar at room temperature, has a direct bandgap of
1.39 electronvolts and has a photocurrent density approximately 50 times larger
than that of the classic ferroelectric (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O3 material. The ability of 
KBNNO to absorb three to six times more solar energy than the current
ferroelectric materials suggests a route to viable ferroelectric
semiconductor-based cells for solar energy conversion and other applications.

DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding
sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins
differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their
properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some
archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes
replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous
recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also
operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax
volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of
individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. 
However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows
significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at
dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement 
for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results 
demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the
replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what
purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) messenger RNAs
contain related (HCV-like) internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) that promote
5'-end independent initiation of translation, requiring only a subset of the
eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) needed for canonical initiation on cellular 
mRNAs. Initiation on HCV-like IRESs relies on their specific interaction with the
40S subunit, which places the initiation codon into the P site, where it directly
base-pairs with eIF2-bound initiator methionyl transfer RNA to form a 48S
initiation complex. However, all HCV-like IRESs also specifically interact with
eIF3 (refs 2, 5-7, 9-12), but the role of this interaction in IRES-mediated
initiation has remained unknown. During canonical initiation, eIF3 binds to the
40S subunit as a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex, and comparison of
the ribosomal positions of eIF3 and the HCV IRES revealed that they overlap, so
that their rearrangement would be required for formation of ribosomal complexes
containing both components. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy
reconstruction of a 40S ribosomal complex containing eIF3 and the CSFV IRES.
Remarkably, although the position and interactions of the CSFV IRES with the 40S 
subunit in this complex are similar to those of the HCV IRES in the 40S-IRES
binary complex, eIF3 is completely displaced from its ribosomal position in the
43S complex, and instead interacts through its ribosome-binding surface
exclusively with the apical region of domain III of the IRES. Our results suggest
a role for the specific interaction of HCV-like IRESs with eIF3 in preventing
ribosomal association of eIF3, which could serve two purposes: relieving the
competition between the IRES and eIF3 for a common binding site on the 40S
subunit, and reducing formation of 43S complexes, thereby favouring translation
of viral mRNAs.

The 2002-3 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) was one of the most significant public health events in recent
history. An ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
suggests that this group of viruses remains a key threat and that their
distribution is wider than previously recognized. Although bats have been
suggested to be the natural reservoirs of both viruses, attempts to isolate the
progenitor virus of SARS-CoV from bats have been unsuccessful. Diverse SARS-like 
coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have now been reported from bats in China, Europe and
Africa, but none is considered a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV because of their
phylogenetic disparity from this virus and the inability of their spike proteins 
to use the SARS-CoV cellular receptor molecule, the human angiotensin converting 
enzyme II (ACE2). Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat
coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan,
China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to
SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the
receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the
first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal
samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9%
sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese
horseshoe bats for cell entry. Preliminary in vitro testing indicates that WIV1
also has a broad species tropism. Our results provide the strongest evidence to
date that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, and that
intermediate hosts may not be necessary for direct human infection by some bat
SL-CoVs. They also highlight the importance of pathogen-discovery programs
targeting high-risk wildlife groups in emerging disease hotspots as a strategy
for pandemic preparedness.

Adiponectin secreted from adipocytes binds to adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and
AdipoR2, and exerts antidiabetic effects via activation of AMPK and PPAR-α
pathways, respectively. Levels of adiponectin in plasma are reduced in obesity,
which causes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Thus, orally active small
molecules that bind to and activate AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 could ameliorate
obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Here we report the
identification of orally active synthetic small-molecule AdipoR agonists. One of 
these compounds, AdipoR agonist (AdipoRon), bound to both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in 
vitro. AdipoRon showed very similar effects to adiponectin in muscle and liver,
such as activation of AMPK and PPAR-α pathways, and ameliorated insulin
resistance and glucose intolerance in mice fed a high-fat diet, which was
completely obliterated in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 double-knockout mice. Moreover,
AdipoRon ameliorated diabetes of genetically obese rodent model db/db mice, and
prolonged the shortened lifespan of db/db mice on a high-fat diet. Thus, orally
active AdipoR agonists such as AdipoRon are a promising therapeutic approach for 
the treatment of obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

Flavoproteins catalyse a diversity of fundamental redox reactions and are one of 
the most studied enzyme families. As monooxygenases, they are universally thought
to control oxygenation by means of a peroxyflavin species that transfers a single
atom of molecular oxygen to an organic substrate. Here we report that the
bacterial flavoenzyme EncM catalyses the peroxyflavin-independent
oxygenation-dehydrogenation dual oxidation of a highly reactive poly(β-carbonyl).
The crystal structure of EncM with bound substrate mimics and isotope labelling
studies reveal previously unknown flavin redox biochemistry. We show that EncM
maintains an unexpected stable flavin-oxygenating species, proposed to be a
flavin-N5-oxide, to promote substrate oxidation and trigger a rare Favorskii-type
rearrangement that is central to the biosynthesis of the antibiotic enterocin.
This work provides new insight into the fine-tuning of the flavin cofactor in
offsetting the innate reactivity of a polyketide substrate to direct its
efficient electrocyclization.

Organic semiconductors are studied intensively for applications in electronics
and optics, and even spin-based information technology, or spintronics.
Fundamental quantities in spintronics are the population relaxation time (T1) and
the phase memory time (T2): T1 measures the lifetime of a classical bit, in this 
case embodied by a spin oriented either parallel or antiparallel to an external
magnetic field, and T2 measures the corresponding lifetime of a quantum bit,
encoded in the phase of the quantum state. Here we establish that these times are
surprisingly long for a common, low-cost and chemically modifiable organic
semiconductor, the blue pigment copper phthalocyanine, in easily processed
thin-film form of the type used for device fabrication. At 5 K, a temperature
reachable using inexpensive closed-cycle refrigerators, T1 and T2 are
respectively 59 ms and 2.6 μs, and at 80 K, which is just above the boiling point
of liquid nitrogen, they are respectively 10 μs and 1 μs, demonstrating that the 
performance of thin-film copper phthalocyanine is superior to that of
single-molecule magnets over the same temperature range. T2 is more than two
orders of magnitude greater than the duration of the spin manipulation pulses,
which suggests that copper phthalocyanine holds promise for quantum information
processing, and the long T1 indicates possibilities for medium-term storage of
classical bits in all-organic devices on plastic substrates.

Identifying cellular and molecular differences between human and non-human
primates (NHPs) is essential to the basic understanding of the evolution and
diversity of our own species. Until now, preserved tissues have been the main
source for most comparative studies between humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
and bonobos (Pan paniscus). However, these tissue samples do not fairly represent
the distinctive traits of live cell behaviour and are not amenable to genetic
manipulation. We propose that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells could be a
unique biological resource to determine relevant phenotypical differences between
human and NHPs, and that those differences could have potential adaptation and
speciation value. Here we describe the generation and initial characterization of
iPS cells from chimpanzees and bonobos as new tools to explore factors that may
have contributed to great ape evolution. Comparative gene expression analysis of 
human and NHP iPS cells revealed differences in the regulation of long
interspersed element-1 (L1, also known as LINE-1) transposons. A force of change 
in mammalian evolution, L1 elements are retrotransposons that have remained
active during primate evolution. Decreased levels of L1-restricting factors
APOBEC3B (also known as A3B) and PIWIL2 (ref. 7) in NHP iPS cells correlated with
increased L1 mobility and endogenous L1 messenger RNA levels. Moreover, results
from the manipulation of A3B and PIWIL2 levels in iPS cells supported a causal
inverse relationship between levels of these proteins and L1 retrotransposition. 
Finally, we found increased copy numbers of species-specific L1 elements in the
genome of chimpanzees compared to humans, supporting the idea that increased L1
mobility in NHPs is not limited to iPS cells in culture and may have also
occurred in the germ line or embryonic cells developmentally upstream to germline
specification during primate evolution. We propose that differences in L1
mobility may have differentially shaped the genomes of humans and NHPs and could 
have continuing adaptive significance.

The mechanisms by which genetic variation affects transcription regulation and
phenotypes at the nucleotide level are incompletely understood. Here we use
natural genetic variation as an in vivo mutagenesis screen to assess the
genome-wide effects of sequence variation on lineage-determining and
signal-specific transcription factor binding, epigenomics and transcriptional
outcomes in primary macrophages from different mouse strains. We find substantial
genetic evidence to support the concept that lineage-determining transcription
factors define epigenetic and transcriptomic states by selecting enhancer-like
regions in the genome in a collaborative fashion and facilitating binding of
signal-dependent factors. This hierarchical model of transcription factor
function suggests that limited sets of genomic data for lineage-determining
transcription factors and informative histone modifications can be used for the
prioritization of disease-associated regulatory variants.

In the mammalian cerebral cortex the diversity of interneuronal subtypes
underlies a division of labour subserving distinct modes of inhibitory control. A
unique mode of inhibitory control may be provided by inhibitory neurons that
specifically suppress the firing of other inhibitory neurons. Such disinhibition 
could lead to the selective amplification of local processing and serve the
important computational functions of gating and gain modulation. Although several
interneuron populations are known to target other interneurons to varying
degrees, little is known about interneurons specializing in disinhibition and
their in vivo function. Here we show that a class of interneurons that express
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) mediates disinhibitory control in
multiple areas of neocortex and is recruited by reinforcement signals. By
combining optogenetic activation with single-cell recordings, we examined the
functional role of VIP interneurons in awake mice, and investigated the
underlying circuit mechanisms in vitro in auditory and medial prefrontal
cortices. We identified a basic disinhibitory circuit module in which activation 
of VIP interneurons transiently suppresses primarily somatostatin- and a fraction
of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that specialize in the control 
of the input and output of principal cells, respectively. During the performance 
of an auditory discrimination task, reinforcement signals (reward and punishment)
strongly and uniformly activated VIP neurons in auditory cortex, and in turn VIP 
recruitment increased the gain of a functional subpopulation of principal
neurons. These results reveal a specific cell type and microcircuit underlying
disinhibitory control in cortex and demonstrate that it is activated under
specific behavioural conditions.

Cell intrinsic immunity spreads to bystander cells via the intercellular transfer
of cGAMP.

The innate immune defence of multicellular organisms against microbial pathogens 
requires cellular collaboration. Information exchange allowing immune cells to
collaborate is generally attributed to soluble protein factors secreted by
pathogen-sensing cells. Cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), serve to
alert non-infected cells to the possibility of pathogen challenge. Moreover, in
conjunction with chemokines they can instruct specialized immune cells to contain
and eradicate microbial infection. Several receptors and signalling pathways
exist that couple pathogen sensing to the induction of cytokines, whereas
cytosolic recognition of nucleic acids seems to be exquisitely important for the 
activation of type I IFNs, master regulators of antiviral immunity. Cytosolic DNA
is sensed by the receptor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which catalyses
the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP(2'-5'). This molecule in turn
activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor STING, thereby
inducing an antiviral state and the secretion of type I IFNs. Here we find in
murine and human cells that cGAS-synthesized cGAMP(2'-5') is transferred from
producing cells to neighbouring cells through gap junctions, where it promotes
STING activation and thus antiviral immunity independently of type I IFN
signalling. In line with the limited cargo specificity of connexins, the proteins
that assemble gap junction channels, most connexins tested were able to confer
this bystander immunity, thus indicating a broad physiological relevance of this 
local immune collaboration. Collectively, these observations identify
cGAS-triggered cGAMP(2'-5') transfer as a novel host strategy that serves to
rapidly convey antiviral immunity in a transcription-independent, horizontal
manner.

Reducing the contact time of a bouncing drop.

Massachusetts 02155, USA [2].

Surfaces designed so that drops do not adhere to them but instead bounce off have
received substantial attention because of their ability to stay dry, self-clean
and resist icing. A drop striking a non-wetting surface of this type will spread 
out to a maximum diameter and then recoil to such an extent that it completely
rebounds and leaves the solid material. The amount of time that the drop is in
contact with the solid--the 'contact time'--depends on the inertia and
capillarity of the drop, internal dissipation and surface-liquid interactions.
And because contact time controls the extent to which mass, momentum and energy
are exchanged between drop and surface, it is often advantageous to minimize it. 
The conventional approach has been to minimize surface-liquid interactions that
can lead to contact line pinning; but even in the absence of any surface
interactions, drop hydrodynamics imposes a minimum contact time that was
conventionally assumed to be attained with axisymmetrically spreading and
recoiling drops. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the contact
time below this theoretical limit by using superhydrophobic surfaces with a
morphology that redistributes the liquid mass and thereby alters the drop
hydrodynamics. We show theoretically and experimentally that this approach allows
us to reduce the overall contact time between a bouncing drop and a surface below
what was previously thought possible.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) transfer from inland waters to the atmosphere, known as CO2 
evasion, is a component of the global carbon cycle. Global estimates of CO2
evasion have been hampered, however, by the lack of a framework for estimating
the inland water surface area and gas transfer velocity and by the absence of a
global CO2 database. Here we report regional variations in global inland water
surface area, dissolved CO2 and gas transfer velocity. We obtain global CO2
evasion rates of 1.8(+0.25)(-0.25)  petagrams of carbon (Pg C) per year from
streams and rivers and 0.32(+0.52)(-0.26)  Pg C yr(-1) from lakes and reservoirs,
where the upper and lower limits are respectively the 5th and 95th confidence
interval percentiles. The resulting global evasion rate of 2.1 Pg C yr(-1) is
higher than previous estimates owing to a larger stream and river evasion rate.
Our analysis predicts global hotspots in stream and river evasion, with about 70 
per cent of the flux occurring over just 20 per cent of the land surface. The
source of inland water CO2 is still not known with certainty and new studies are 
needed to research the mechanisms controlling CO2 evasion globally.

Chronic infections are difficult to treat with antibiotics but are caused
primarily by drug-sensitive pathogens. Dormant persister cells that are tolerant 
to killing by antibiotics are responsible for this apparent paradox. Persisters
are phenotypic variants of normal cells and pathways leading to dormancy are
redundant, making it challenging to develop anti-persister compounds. Biofilms
shield persisters from the immune system, suggesting that an antibiotic for
treating a chronic infection should be able to eradicate the infection on its
own. We reasoned that a compound capable of corrupting a target in dormant cells 
will kill persisters. The acyldepsipeptide antibiotic (ADEP4) has been shown to
activate the ClpP protease, resulting in death of growing cells. Here we show
that ADEP4-activated ClpP becomes a fairly nonspecific protease and kills
persisters by degrading over 400 proteins, forcing cells to self-digest. Null
mutants of clpP arise with high probability, but combining ADEP4 with rifampicin 
produced complete eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in vitro and in a
mouse model of a chronic infection. Our findings indicate a general principle for
killing dormant cells-activation and corruption of a target, rather than
conventional inhibition. Eradication of a biofilm in an animal model by
activating a protease suggests a realistic path towards developing therapies to
treat chronic infections.

The remarkable ecological and demographic success of humanity is largely
attributed to our capacity for cumulative culture. The accumulation of beneficial
cultural innovations across generations is puzzling because transmission events
are generally imperfect, although there is large variance in fidelity. Events of 
perfect cultural transmission and innovations should be more frequent in a large 
population. As a consequence, a large population size may be a prerequisite for
the evolution of cultural complexity, although anthropological studies have
produced mixed results and empirical evidence is lacking. Here we use a dual-task
computer game to show that cultural evolution strongly depends on population
size, as players in larger groups maintained higher cultural complexity. We found
that when group size increases, cultural knowledge is less deteriorated,
improvements to existing cultural traits are more frequent, and cultural trait
diversity is maintained more often. Our results demonstrate how changes in group 
size can generate both adaptive cultural evolution and maladaptive losses of
culturally acquired skills. As humans live in habitats for which they are
ill-suited without specific cultural adaptations, it suggests that, in our
evolutionary past, group-size reduction may have exposed human societies to
significant risks, including societal collapse.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is able to replicate in primary human
macrophages without stimulating innate immunity despite reverse transcription of 
genomic RNA into double-stranded DNA, an activity that might be expected to
trigger innate pattern recognition receptors. We reasoned that if correctly
orchestrated HIV-1 uncoating and nuclear entry is important for evasion of innate
sensors then manipulation of specific interactions between HIV-1 capsid and host 
factors that putatively regulate these processes should trigger pattern
recognition receptors and stimulate type 1 interferon (IFN) secretion. Here we
show that HIV-1 capsid mutants N74D and P90A, which are impaired for interaction 
with cofactors cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6) 
and cyclophilins (Nup358 and CypA), respectively, cannot replicate in primary
human monocyte-derived macrophages because they trigger innate sensors leading to
nuclear translocation of NF-κB and IRF3, the production of soluble type 1 IFN and
induction of an antiviral state. Depletion of CPSF6 with short hairpin RNA
expression allows wild-type virus to trigger innate sensors and IFN production.
In each case, suppressed replication is rescued by IFN-receptor blockade,
demonstrating a role for IFN in restriction. IFN production is dependent on viral
reverse transcription but not integration, indicating that a viral reverse
transcription product comprises the HIV-1 pathogen-associated molecular pattern. 
Finally, we show that we can pharmacologically induce wild-type HIV-1 infection
to stimulate IFN secretion and an antiviral state using a non-immunosuppressive
cyclosporine analogue. We conclude that HIV-1 has evolved to use CPSF6 and
cyclophilins to cloak its replication, allowing evasion of innate immune sensors 
and induction of a cell-autonomous innate immune response in primary human
macrophages.

Recent analyses of data from the NASA Kepler spacecraft have established that
planets with radii within 25 per cent of the Earth's (R Earth symbol) are
commonplace throughout the Galaxy, orbiting at least 16.5 per cent of Sun-like
stars. Because these studies were sensitive to the sizes of the planets but not
their masses, the question remains whether these Earth-sized planets are indeed
similar to the Earth in bulk composition. The smallest planets for which masses
have been accurately determined are Kepler-10b (1.42 R Earth symbol) and
Kepler-36b (1.49 R Earth symbol), which are both significantly larger than the
Earth. Recently, the planet Kepler-78b was discovered and found to have a radius 
of only 1.16 R Earth symbol. Here we report that the mass of this planet is 1.86 
Earth masses. The resulting mean density of the planet is 5.57 g cm(-3), which is
similar to that of the Earth and implies a composition of iron and rock.

Planets with sizes between that of Earth (with radius R Earth symbol) and Neptune
(about 4R Earth symbol) are now known to be common around Sun-like stars. Most
such planets have been discovered through the transit technique, by which the
planet's size can be determined from the fraction of starlight blocked by the
planet as it passes in front of its star. Measuring the planet's mass--and hence 
its density, which is a clue to its composition--is more difficult. Planets of
size 2-4R Earth symbol have proved to have a wide range of densities, implying a 
diversity of compositions, but these measurements did not extend to planets as
small as Earth. Here we report Doppler spectroscopic measurements of the mass of 
the Earth-sized planet Kepler-78b, which orbits its host star every 8.5 hours
(ref. 6). Given a radius of 1.20 ± 0.09 R Earth symbol and a mass of 1.69 ± 0.41 
R Earth symbol, the planet's mean density of 5.3 ± 1.8 g cm(-3) is similar to
Earth's, suggesting a composition of rock and iron.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 15-30% of
children and approximately 5% of adults in industrialized countries. Although the
pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is not fully understood, the disease is
mediated by an abnormal immunoglobulin-E immune response in the setting of skin
barrier dysfunction. Mast cells contribute to immunoglobulin-E-mediated allergic 
disorders including atopic dermatitis. Upon activation, mast cells release their 
membrane-bound cytosolic granules leading to the release of several molecules
that are important in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and host defence.
More than 90% of patients with atopic dermatitis are colonized with
Staphylococcus aureus in the lesional skin whereas most healthy individuals do
not harbour the pathogen. Several staphylococcal exotoxins can act as
superantigens and/or antigens in models of atopic dermatitis. However, the role
of these staphylococcal exotoxins in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here
we report that culture supernatants of S. aureus contain potent mast-cell
degranulation activity. Biochemical analysis identified δ-toxin as the mast cell 
degranulation-inducing factor produced by S. aureus. Mast cell degranulation
induced by δ-toxin depended on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and calcium (Ca(2+))
influx; however, unlike that mediated by immunoglobulin-E crosslinking, it did
not require the spleen tyrosine kinase. In addition, immunoglobulin-E enhanced
δ-toxin-induced mast cell degranulation in the absence of antigen. Furthermore,
S. aureus isolates recovered from patients with atopic dermatitis produced large 
amounts of δ-toxin. Skin colonization with S. aureus, but not a mutant deficient 
in δ-toxin, promoted immunoglobulin-E and interleukin-4 production, as well as
inflammatory skin disease. Furthermore, enhancement of immunoglobulin-E
production and dermatitis by δ-toxin was abrogated in Kit(W-sh/W-sh)
mast-cell-deficient mice and restored by mast cell reconstitution. These studies 
identify δ-toxin as a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation and suggest a
mechanistic link between S. aureus colonization and allergic skin disease.

Circadian oscillation of body temperature is a basic, evolutionarily conserved
feature of mammalian biology. In addition, homeostatic pathways allow organisms
to protect their core temperatures in response to cold exposure. However, the
mechanism responsible for coordinating daily body temperature rhythm and
adaptability to environmental challenges is unknown. Here we show that the
nuclear receptor Rev-erbα (also known as Nr1d1), a powerful transcriptional
repressor, links circadian and thermogenic networks through the regulation of
brown adipose tissue (BAT) function. Mice exposed to cold fare considerably
better at 05:00 (Zeitgeber time 22) when Rev-erbα is barely expressed than at
17:00 (Zeitgeber time 10) when Rev-erbα is abundant. Deletion of Rev-erbα
markedly improves cold tolerance at 17:00, indicating that overcoming
Rev-erbα-dependent repression is a fundamental feature of the thermogenic
response to cold. Physiological induction of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) by cold 
temperatures is preceded by rapid downregulation of Rev-erbα in BAT. Rev-erbα
represses Ucp1 in a brown-adipose-cell-autonomous manner and BAT Ucp1 levels are 
high in Rev-erbα-null mice, even at thermoneutrality. Genetic loss of Rev-erbα
also abolishes normal rhythms of body temperature and BAT activity. Thus,
Rev-erbα acts as a thermogenic focal point required for establishing and
maintaining body temperature rhythm in a manner that is adaptable to
environmental demands.

Influenza A virus-specific B lymphocytes and the antibodies they produce protect 
against infection. However, the outcome of interactions between an influenza
haemagglutinin-specific B cell via its receptor (BCR) and virus is unclear.
Through somatic cell nuclear transfer we generated mice that harbour B cells with
a BCR specific for the haemagglutinin of influenza A/WSN/33 virus (FluBI mice).
Their B cells secrete an immunoglobulin gamma 2b that neutralizes infectious
virus. Whereas B cells from FluBI and control mice bind equivalent amounts of
virus through interaction of haemagglutinin with surface-disposed sialic acids,
the A/WSN/33 virus infects only the haemagglutinin-specific B cells. Mere binding
of virus is not sufficient for infection of B cells: this requires interactions
of the BCR with haemagglutinin, causing both disruption of antibody secretion and
FluBI B-cell death within 18 h. In mice infected with A/WSN/33, lung-resident
FluBI B cells are infected by the virus, thus delaying the onset of protective
antibody release into the lungs, whereas FluBI cells in the draining lymph node
are not infected and proliferate. We propose that influenza targets and kills
influenza-specific B cells in the lung, thus allowing the virus to gain purchase 
before the initiation of an effective adaptive response.

Linear ubiquitin chains are important regulators of cellular signalling pathways 
that control innate immunity and inflammation through nuclear factor (NF)-κB
activation and protection against tumour necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis.
They are synthesized by HOIP, which belongs to the RBR (RING-between-RING) family
of E3 ligases and is the catalytic component of LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain
assembly complex), a multisubunit E3 ligase. RBR family members act as RING/HECT 
hybrids, employing RING1 to recognize ubiquitin-loaded E2 while a conserved
cysteine in RING2 subsequently forms a thioester intermediate with the
transferred or 'donor' ubiquitin. Here we report the crystal structure of the
catalytic core of HOIP in its apo form and in complex with ubiquitin. The
carboxy-terminal portion of HOIP adopts a novel fold that, together with a
zinc-finger, forms a ubiquitin-binding platform that orients the acceptor
ubiquitin and positions its α-amino group for nucleophilic attack on the
E3∼ubiquitin thioester. The C-terminal tail of a second ubiquitin molecule is
located in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine, providing a unique snapshot
of the ubiquitin transfer complex containing both donor and acceptor ubiquitin.
These interactions are required for activation of the NF-κB pathway in vivo, and 
they explain the determinants of linear ubiquitin chain specificity by LUBAC.

Many organs with a high cell turnover (for example, skin, intestine and blood)
are composed of short-lived cells that require continuous replenishment by
somatic stem cells. Ageing results in the inability of these tissues to maintain 
homeostasis and it is believed that somatic stem-cell ageing is one underlying
cause of tissue attrition with age or age-related diseases. Ageing of
haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is associated with impaired haematopoiesis in
the elderly. Despite a large amount of data describing the decline of HSC
function on ageing, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain largely
unknown, which precludes rational approaches to attenuate stem-cell ageing. Here 
we report an unexpected shift from canonical to non-canonical Wnt signalling in
mice due to elevated expression of Wnt5a in aged HSCs, which causes stem-cell
ageing. Wnt5a treatment of young HSCs induces ageing-associated stem-cell
apolarity, reduction of regenerative capacity and an ageing-like myeloid-lymphoid
differentiation skewing via activation of the small Rho GTPase Cdc42. Conversely,
Wnt5a haploinsufficiency attenuates HSC ageing, whereas stem-cell-intrinsic
reduction of Wnt5a expression results in functionally rejuvenated aged HSCs. Our 
data demonstrate a critical role for stem-cell-intrinsic non-canonical Wnt5a
signalling in HSC ageing.

Linus Pauling established the conceptual framework for understanding and
mimicking enzymes more than six decades ago. The notion that enzymes selectively 
stabilize the rate-limiting transition state of the catalysed reaction relative
to the bound ground state reduces the problem of design to one of molecular
recognition. Nevertheless, past attempts to capitalize on this idea, for example 
by using transition state analogues to elicit antibodies with catalytic
activities, have generally failed to deliver true enzymatic rates. The advent of 
computational design approaches, combined with directed evolution, has provided
an opportunity to revisit this problem. Starting from a computationally designed 
catalyst for the Kemp elimination--a well-studied model system for proton
transfer from carbon--we show that an artificial enzyme can be evolved that
accelerates an elementary chemical reaction 6 × 10(8)-fold, approaching the
exceptional efficiency of highly optimized natural enzymes such as
triosephosphate isomerase. A 1.09 Å resolution crystal structure of the evolved
enzyme indicates that familiar catalytic strategies such as shape complementarity
and precisely placed catalytic groups can be successfully harnessed to afford
such high rate accelerations, making us optimistic about the prospects of
designing more sophisticated catalysts.

DNA methylation was first described almost a century ago; however, the rules
governing its establishment and maintenance remain elusive. Here we present data 
demonstrating that active transcription regulates levels of genomic methylation. 
We identify a novel RNA arising from the CEBPA gene locus that is critical in
regulating the local DNA methylation profile. This RNA binds to DNMT1 and
prevents CEBPA gene locus methylation. Deep sequencing of transcripts associated 
with DNMT1 combined with genome-scale methylation and expression profiling extend
the generality of this finding to numerous gene loci. Collectively, these results
delineate the nature of DNMT1-RNA interactions and suggest strategies for
gene-selective demethylation of therapeutic targets in human diseases.

The appropriate timing of flowering is crucial for plant reproductive success. It
is therefore not surprising that intricate genetic networks have evolved to
perceive and integrate both endogenous and environmental signals, such as
carbohydrate and hormonal status, photoperiod and temperature. In contrast to our
detailed understanding of the vernalization pathway, little is known about how
flowering time is controlled in response to changes in the ambient growth
temperature. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MADS-box transcription factor genes
FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) have key roles in this
process. FLM is subject to temperature-dependent alternative splicing. Here we
report that the two main FLM protein splice variants, FLM-β and FLM-δ, compete
for interaction with the floral repressor SVP. The SVP-FLM-β complex is
predominately formed at low temperatures and prevents precocious flowering. By
contrast, the competing SVP-FLM-δ complex is impaired in DNA binding and acts as 
a dominant-negative activator of flowering at higher temperatures. Our results
show a new mechanism that controls the timing of the floral transition in
response to changes in ambient temperature. A better understanding of how
temperature controls the molecular mechanisms of flowering will be important to
cope with current changes in global climate.

After fertilization, maternal factors direct development and trigger zygotic
genome activation (ZGA) at the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). In
zebrafish, ZGA is required for gastrulation and clearance of maternal messenger
RNAs, which is in part regulated by the conserved microRNA miR-430. However, the 
factors that activate the zygotic program in vertebrates are unknown. Here we
show that Nanog, Pou5f1 (also called Oct4) and SoxB1 regulate zygotic gene
activation in zebrafish. We identified several hundred genes directly activated
by maternal factors, constituting the first wave of zygotic transcription.
Ribosome profiling revealed that nanog, sox19b and pou5f1 are the most highly
translated transcription factors pre-MZT. Combined loss of these factors resulted
in developmental arrest before gastrulation and a failure to activate >75% of
zygotic genes, including miR-430. Our results demonstrate that maternal Nanog,
Pou5f1 and SoxB1 are required to initiate the zygotic developmental program and
induce clearance of the maternal program by activating miR-430 expression.

High-salinity groundwater more than 1,000 metres deep in the Atlantic coastal
plain of the USA has been documented in several locations, most recently within
the 35-million-year-old Chesapeake Bay impact crater. Suggestions for the origin 
of increased salinity in the crater have included evaporite dissolution, osmosis 
and evaporation from heating associated with the bolide impact. Here we present
chemical, isotopic and physical evidence that together indicate that groundwater 
in the Chesapeake crater is remnant Early Cretaceous North Atlantic (ECNA) sea
water. We find that the sea water is probably 100-145 million years old and that 
it has an average salinity of about 70 per mil, which is twice that of modern sea
water and consistent with the nearly closed ECNA basin. Previous evidence for
temperature and salinity levels of ancient oceans have been estimated indirectly 
from geochemical, isotopic and palaeontological analyses of solid materials in
deep sediment cores. In contrast, our study identifies ancient sea water in situ 
and provides a direct estimate of its age and salinity. Moreover, we suggest that
it is likely that remnants of ECNA sea water persist in deep sediments at many
locations along the Atlantic margin.

Single magnetic atoms, and assemblies of such atoms, on non-magnetic surfaces
have recently attracted attention owing to their potential use in high-density
magnetic data storage and as a platform for quantum computing. A fundamental
problem resulting from their quantum mechanical nature is that the localized
magnetic moments of these atoms are easily destabilized by interactions with
electrons, nuclear spins and lattice vibrations of the substrate. Even when large
magnetic fields are applied to stabilize the magnetic moment, the observed
lifetimes remain rather short (less than a microsecond). Several routes for
stabilizing the magnetic moment against fluctuations have been suggested, such as
using thin insulating layers between the magnetic atom and the substrate to
suppress the interactions with the substrate's conduction electrons, or coupling 
several magnetic moments together to reduce their quantum mechanical
fluctuations. Here we show that the magnetic moments of single holmium atoms on a
highly conductive metallic substrate can reach lifetimes of the order of minutes.
The necessary decoupling from the thermal bath of electrons, nuclear spins and
lattice vibrations is achieved by a remarkable combination of several symmetries 
intrinsic to the system: time reversal symmetry, the internal symmetries of the
total angular momentum and the point symmetry of the local environment of the
magnetic atom.

The phonon is the physical particle representing mechanical vibration and is
responsible for the transmission of everyday sound and heat. Understanding and
controlling the phononic properties of materials provides opportunities to
thermally insulate buildings, reduce environmental noise, transform waste heat
into electricity and develop earthquake protection. Here I review recent progress
and the development of new ideas and devices that make use of phononic properties
to control both sound and heat. Advances in sonic and thermal diodes,
optomechanical crystals, acoustic and thermal cloaking, hypersonic phononic
crystals, thermoelectrics, and thermocrystals herald the next technological
revolution in phononics.

In nuclear pre-messenger RNA splicing, introns are excised by the spliceosome, a 
dynamic machine composed of both proteins and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Over
thirty years ago, after the discovery of self-splicing group II intron RNAs, the 
snRNAs were proposed to catalyse splicing. However, no definitive evidence for a 
role of either RNA or protein in catalysis by the spliceosome has been reported
so far. By using metal rescue strategies in spliceosomes from budding yeast, here
we show that the U6 snRNA catalyses both of the two splicing reactions by
positioning divalent metals that stabilize the leaving groups during each
reaction. Notably, all of the U6 catalytic metal ligands we identified correspond
to the ligands observed to position catalytic, divalent metals in crystal
structures of a group II intron RNA. These findings indicate that group II
introns and the spliceosome share common catalytic mechanisms and probably common
evolutionary origins. Our results demonstrate that RNA mediates catalysis within 
the spliceosome.

Cellular plasticity contributes to the regenerative capacity of plants,
invertebrates, teleost fishes and amphibians. In vertebrates, differentiated
cells are known to revert into replicating progenitors, but these cells do not
persist as stable stem cells. Here we present evidence that differentiated airway
epithelial cells can revert into stable and functional stem cells in vivo. After 
the ablation of airway stem cells, we observed a surprising increase in the
proliferation of committed secretory cells. Subsequent lineage tracing
demonstrated that the luminal secretory cells had dedifferentiated into basal
stem cells. Dedifferentiated cells were morphologically indistinguishable from
stem cells and they functioned as well as their endogenous counterparts in
repairing epithelial injury. Single secretory cells clonally dedifferentiated
into multipotent stem cells when they were cultured ex vivo without basal stem
cells. By contrast, direct contact with a single basal stem cell was sufficient
to prevent secretory cell dedifferentiation. In analogy to classical descriptions
of amphibian nuclear reprogramming, the propensity of committed cells to
dedifferentiate is inversely correlated to their state of maturity. This capacity
of committed cells to dedifferentiate into stem cells may have a more general
role in the regeneration of many tissues and in multiple disease states, notably 
cancer.

Most large (over a kilometre in diameter) near-Earth asteroids are now known, but
recognition that airbursts (or fireballs resulting from nuclear-weapon-sized
detonations of meteoroids in the atmosphere) have the potential to do greater
damage than previously thought has shifted an increasing portion of the residual 
impact risk (the risk of impact from an unknown object) to smaller objects. Above
the threshold size of impactor at which the atmosphere absorbs sufficient energy 
to prevent a ground impact, most of the damage is thought to be caused by the
airburst shock wave, but owing to lack of observations this is uncertain. Here we
report an analysis of the damage from the airburst of an asteroid about 19 metres
(17 to 20 metres) in diameter southeast of Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February
2013, estimated to have an energy equivalent of approximately 500 (±100) kilotons
of trinitrotoluene (TNT, where 1 kiloton of TNT = 4.185×10(12) joules). We show
that a widely referenced technique of estimating airburst damage does not
reproduce the observations, and that the mathematical relations based on the
effects of nuclear weapons--almost always used with this technique--overestimate 
blast damage. This suggests that earlier damage estimates near the threshold
impactor size are too high. We performed a global survey of airbursts of a
kiloton or more (including Chelyabinsk), and find that the number of impactors
with diameters of tens of metres may be an order of magnitude higher than
estimates based on other techniques. This suggests a non-equilibrium (if the
population were in a long-term collisional steady state the size-frequency
distribution would either follow a single power law or there must be a
size-dependent bias in other surveys) in the near-Earth asteroid population for
objects 10 to 50 metres in diameter, and shifts more of the residual impact risk 
to these sizes.

Earth is continuously colliding with fragments of asteroids and comets of various
sizes. The largest encounter in historical times occurred over the Tunguska river
in Siberia in 1908, producing an airburst of energy equivalent to 5-15 megatons
of trinitrotoluene (1 kiloton of trinitrotoluene represents an energy of
4.185 × 10(12) joules). Until recently, the next most energetic airburst events
occurred over Indonesia in 2009 and near the Marshall Islands in 1994, both with 
energies of several tens of kilotons. Here we report an analysis of selected
video records of the Chelyabinsk superbolide of 15 February 2013, with energy
equivalent to 500 kilotons of trinitrotoluene, and details of its atmospheric
passage. We found that its orbit was similar to the orbit of the
two-kilometre-diameter asteroid 86039 (1999 NC43), to a degree of statistical
significance sufficient to suggest that the two were once part of the same
object. The bulk strength--the ability to resist breakage--of the Chelyabinsk
asteroid, of about one megapascal, was similar to that of smaller meteoroids and 
corresponds to a heavily fractured single stone. The asteroid broke into small
pieces between the altitudes of 45 and 30 kilometres, preventing more-serious
damage on the ground. The total mass of surviving fragments larger than 100 grams
was lower than expected.

The concept of hierarchical bottom-up structuring commonly encountered in natural
materials provides inspiration for the design of complex artificial materials
with advanced functionalities. Natural processes have achieved the orchestration 
of multicomponent systems across many length scales with very high precision, but
man-made self-assemblies still face obstacles in realizing well-defined
hierarchical structures. In particle-based self-assembly, the challenge is to
program symmetries and periodicities of superstructures by providing monodisperse
building blocks with suitable shape anisotropy or anisotropic interaction
patterns ('patches'). Irregularities in particle architecture are intolerable
because they generate defects that amplify throughout the hierarchical levels.
For patchy microscopic hard colloids, this challenge has been approached by using
top-down methods (such as metal shading or microcontact printing), enabling
molecule-like directionality during aggregation. However, both top-down
procedures and particulate systems based on molecular assembly struggle to
fabricate patchy particles controllably in the desired size regime (10-100 nm).
Here we introduce the co-assembly of dynamic patchy nanoparticles--that is, soft 
patchy nanoparticles that are intrinsically self-assembled and monodisperse--as a
modular approach for producing well-ordered binary and ternary supracolloidal
hierarchical assemblies. We bridge up to three hierarchical levels by guiding
triblock terpolymers (length scale ∼10 nm) to form soft patchy nanoparticles
(20-50 nm) of different symmetries that, in combination, co-assemble into
substructured, compartmentalized materials (>10 μm) with predictable and tunable 
nanoscale periodicities. We establish how molecular control over polymer
composition programs the building block symmetries and regulates particle
positioning, offering a route to well-ordered mixed mesostructures of high
complexity.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific monoclonal antibodies with
extraordinary potency and breadth have recently been described. In humanized
mice, combinations of monoclonal antibodies have been shown to suppress viraemia,
but the therapeutic potential of these monoclonal antibodies has not yet been
evaluated in primates with an intact immune system. Here we show that
administration of a cocktail of HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies, as well as 
the single glycan-dependent monoclonal antibody PGT121, resulted in a rapid and
precipitous decline of plasma viraemia to undetectable levels in rhesus monkeys
chronically infected with the pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus
SHIV-SF162P3. A single monoclonal antibody infusion afforded up to a 3.1 log
decline of plasma viral RNA in 7 days and also reduced proviral DNA in peripheral
blood, gastrointestinal mucosa and lymph nodes without the development of viral
resistance. Moreover, after monoclonal antibody administration, host Gag-specific
T-lymphocyte responses showed improved functionality. Virus rebounded in most
animals after a median of 56 days when serum monoclonal antibody titres had
declined to undetectable levels, although, notably, a subset of animals
maintained long-term virological control in the absence of further monoclonal
antibody infusions. These data demonstrate a profound therapeutic effect of
potent neutralizing HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies in SHIV-infected rhesus 
monkeys as well as an impact on host immune responses. Our findings strongly
encourage the investigation of monoclonal antibody therapy for HIV-1 in humans.

Neutralizing antibodies can confer immunity to primate lentiviruses by blocking
infection in macaque models of AIDS. However, earlier studies of anti-human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizing antibodies administered to
infected individuals or humanized mice reported poor control of virus replication
and the rapid emergence of resistant variants. A new generation of anti-HIV-1
monoclonal antibodies, possessing extraordinary potency and breadth of
neutralizing activity, has recently been isolated from infected individuals.
These neutralizing antibodies target different regions of the HIV-1 envelope
glycoprotein including the CD4-binding site, glycans located in the V1/V2, V3 and
V4 regions, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41 (refs 9-14). Here
we have examined two of the new antibodies, directed to the CD4-binding site and 
the V3 region (3BNC117 and 10-1074, respectively), for their ability to block
infection and suppress viraemia in macaques infected with the R5 tropic
simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-AD8, which emulates many of the
pathogenic and immunogenic properties of HIV-1 during infections of rhesus
macaques. Either antibody alone can potently block virus acquisition. When
administered individually to recently infected macaques, the 10-1074 antibody
caused a rapid decline in virus load to undetectable levels for 4-7 days,
followed by virus rebound during which neutralization-resistant variants became
detectable. When administered together, a single treatment rapidly suppressed
plasma viraemia for 3-5 weeks in some long-term chronically SHIV-infected animals
with low CD4(+) T-cell levels. A second cycle of anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibody
therapy, administered to two previously treated animals, successfully controlled 
virus rebound. These results indicate that immunotherapy or a combination of
immunotherapy plus conventional antiretroviral drugs might be useful as a
treatment for chronically HIV-1-infected individuals experiencing immune
dysfunction.

A large number of cis-regulatory sequences have been annotated in the human
genome, but defining their target genes remains a challenge. One strategy is to
identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of
chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques. However, previous studies 
lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of
chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map 
generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C). We 
determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5-10-kb
resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at
different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of
promoter-enhancer contacts after TNF-α signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly,
we found that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target
promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also
exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong
predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional 
chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively
stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a
ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.

patients.

Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized by global developmental delay, severely impaired speech,
intellectual disability, and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders
(ASDs). PMDS is caused by heterozygous deletions of chromosome 22q13.3. Among the
genes in the deleted region is SHANK3, which encodes a protein in the
postsynaptic density (PSD). Rare mutations in SHANK3 have been associated with
idiopathic ASDs, non-syndromic intellectual disability, and schizophrenia.
Although SHANK3 is considered to be the most likely candidate gene for the
neurological abnormalities in PMDS patients, the cellular and molecular
phenotypes associated with this syndrome in human neurons are unknown. We
generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from individuals with PMDS and
autism and used them to produce functional neurons. We show that PMDS neurons
have reduced SHANK3 expression and major defects in excitatory, but not
inhibitory, synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic transmission in PMDS
neurons can be corrected by restoring SHANK3 expression or by treating neurons
with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). IGF1 treatment promotes formation of
mature excitatory synapses that lack SHANK3 but contain PSD95 and
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with fast deactivation kinetics. Our
findings provide direct evidence for a disruption in the ratio of cellular
excitation and inhibition in PMDS neurons, and point to a molecular pathway that 
can be recruited to restore it.

Cell migration requires the generation of branched actin networks that power the 
protrusion of the plasma membrane in lamellipodia. The actin-related proteins 2
and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is the molecular machine that nucleates these branched
actin networks. This machine is activated at the leading edge of migrating cells 
by Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin-homologous protein
(WAVE, also known as SCAR). The WAVE complex is itself directly activated by the 
small GTPase Rac, which induces lamellipodia. However, how cells regulate the
directionality of migration is poorly understood. Here we identify a new protein,
Arpin, that inhibits the Arp2/3 complex in vitro, and show that Rac signalling
recruits and activates Arpin at the lamellipodial tip, like WAVE. Consistently,
after depletion of the inhibitory Arpin, lamellipodia protrude faster and cells
migrate faster. A major role of this inhibitory circuit, however, is to control
directional persistence of migration. Indeed, Arpin depletion in both mammalian
cells and Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba resulted in straighter trajectories,
whereas Arpin microinjection in fish keratocytes, one of the most persistent
systems of cell migration, induced these cells to turn. The coexistence of the
Rac-Arpin-Arp2/3 inhibitory circuit with the Rac-WAVE-Arp2/3 activatory circuit
can account for this conserved role of Arpin in steering cell migration.

The Eumetabola (Endopterygota (also known as Holometabola) plus Paraneoptera)
have the highest number of species of any clade, and greatly contribute to animal
species biodiversity. The palaeoecological circumstances that favoured their
emergence and success remain an intriguing question. Recent molecular
phylogenetic analyses have suggested a wide range of dates for the initial
appearance of the Holometabola, from the Middle Devonian epoch (391 million years
(Myr) ago) to the Late Pennsylvanian epoch (311 Myr ago), and Hemiptera (310 Myr 
ago). Palaeoenvironments greatly changed over these periods, with global cooling 
and increasing complexity of green forests. The Pennsylvanian-period
crown-eumetabolan fossil record remains notably incomplete, particularly as
several fossils have been erroneously considered to be stem Holometabola
(Supplementary Information); the earliest definitive beetles are from the start
of the Permian period. The emergence of the hymenopterids, sister group to other 
Holometabola, is dated between 350 and 309 Myr ago, incongruent with their
current earliest record (Middle Triassic epoch). Here we describe five fossils--a
Gzhelian-age stem coleopterid, a holometabolous larva of uncertain ordinal
affinity, a stem hymenopterid, and early Hemiptera and Psocodea, all from the
Moscovian age--and reveal a notable penecontemporaneous breadth of early
eumetabolan insects. These discoveries are more congruent with current hypotheses
of clade divergence. Eumetabola experienced episodes of diversification during
the Bashkirian-Moscovian and the Kasimovian-Gzhelian ages. This cladogenetic
activity is perhaps related to notable episodes of drying resulting from
glaciations, leading to the eventual demise in Euramerica of coal-swamp
ecosystems, evidenced by floral turnover during this interval. These ancient
species were of very small size, living in the shadow of Palaeozoic-era 'giant'
insects. Although these discoveries reveal unexpected Pennsylvanian eumetabolan
diversity, the lineage radiated more successfully only after the mass extinctions
at the end of the Permian period, giving rise to the familiar crown groups of
their respective clades.

The design of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) allosteric modulators, an active 
area of modern pharmaceutical research, has proved challenging because neither
the binding modes nor the molecular mechanisms of such drugs are known. Here we
determine binding sites, bound conformations and specific drug-receptor
interactions for several allosteric modulators of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine
receptor (M2 receptor), a prototypical family A GPCR, using atomic-level
simulations in which the modulators spontaneously associate with the receptor.
Despite substantial structural diversity, all modulators form cation-π
interactions with clusters of aromatic residues in the receptor extracellular
vestibule, approximately 15 Å from the classical, 'orthosteric' ligand-binding
site. We validate the observed modulator binding modes through radioligand
binding experiments on receptor mutants designed, on the basis of our
simulations, either to increase or to decrease modulator affinity. Simulations
also revealed mechanisms that contribute to positive and negative allosteric
modulation of classical ligand binding, including coupled conformational changes 
of the two binding sites and electrostatic interactions between ligands in these 
sites. These observations enabled the design of chemical modifications that
substantially alter a modulator's allosteric effects. Our findings thus provide a
structural basis for the rational design of allosteric modulators targeting
muscarinic and possibly other GPCRs.

Many animals, including insects, are known to use visual landmarks to orient in
their environment. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have 
identified a higher brain structure called the central complex as being required 
for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual features and its short- and
long-term memory for visual patterns. But whether and how neurons of the fly
central complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use two-photon
calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying flies to probe visuomotor
responses of ring neurons--a class of central complex neurons that have been
implicated in landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies and memory for
visual patterns in tethered flying flies. We show that dendrites of ring neurons 
are visually responsive and arranged retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive
fields comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of
simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring neurons show strong
and, in some cases, direction-selective orientation tuning, with a notable
preference for vertically oriented features similar to those that evoke innate
responses in flies. Visual responses were diminished during flight, but, in
contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex in the control of
locomotion, not modulated during walking. Taken together, these results indicate 
that ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's
environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to produce appropriate 
motor commands. More broadly, this study opens the door to mechanistic
investigations of circuit computations underlying visually guided action
selection in the Drosophila central complex.

The recognition of autophagy related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) as a genetic risk factor
has exposed the critical role of autophagy in Crohn's disease. Homozygosity for
the highly prevalent ATG16L1 risk allele, or murine hypomorphic (HM) activity,
causes Paneth cell dysfunction. As Atg16l1(HM) mice do not develop spontaneous
intestinal inflammation, the mechanism(s) by which ATG16L1 contributes to disease
remains obscure. Deletion of the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription
factor X-box binding protein-1 (Xbp1) in intestinal epithelial cells, the human
orthologue of which harbours rare inflammatory bowel disease risk variants,
results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Paneth cell impairment and
spontaneous enteritis. Unresolved ER stress is a common feature of inflammatory
bowel disease epithelium, and several genetic risk factors of Crohn's disease
affect Paneth cells. Here we show that impairment in either UPR (Xbp1(ΔIEC)) or
autophagy function (Atg16l1(ΔIEC) or Atg7(ΔIEC)) in intestinal epithelial cells
results in each other's compensatory engagement, and severe spontaneous
Crohn's-disease-like transmural ileitis if both mechanisms are compromised.
Xbp1(ΔIEC) mice show autophagosome formation in hypomorphic Paneth cells, which
is linked to ER stress via protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK), elongation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and activating transcription
factor 4 (ATF4). Ileitis is dependent on commensal microbiota and derives from
increased intestinal epithelial cell death, inositol requiring enzyme 1α
(IRE1α)-regulated NF-κB activation and tumour-necrosis factor signalling, which
are synergistically increased when autophagy is deficient. ATG16L1 restrains
IRE1α activity, and augmentation of autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells
ameliorates ER stress-induced intestinal inflammation and eases NF-κB
overactivation and intestinal epithelial cell death. ER stress, autophagy
induction and spontaneous ileitis emerge from Paneth-cell-specific deletion of
Xbp1. Genetically and environmentally controlled UPR function within Paneth cells
may therefore set the threshold for the development of intestinal inflammation
upon hypomorphic ATG16L1 function and implicate ileal Crohn's disease as a
specific disorder of Paneth cells.

The directed migration of cell collectives is a driving force of embryogenesis.
The predominant view in the field is that cells in embryos navigate along
pre-patterned chemoattractant gradients. One hypothetical way to free migrating
collectives from the requirement of long-range gradients would be through the
self-generation of local gradients that travel with them, a strategy that
potentially allows self-determined directionality. However, a lack of tools for
the visualization of endogenous guidance cues has prevented the demonstration of 
such self-generated gradients in vivo. Here we define the in vivo dynamics of one
key guidance molecule, the chemokine Cxcl12a, by applying a fluorescent timer
approach to measure ligand-triggered receptor turnover in living animals. Using
the zebrafish lateral line primordium as a model, we show that migrating cell
collectives can self-generate gradients of chemokine activity across their length
via polarized receptor-mediated internalization. Finally, by engineering an
external source of the atypical receptor Cxcr7 that moves with the primordium, we
show that a self-generated gradient mechanism is sufficient to direct robust
collective migration. This study thus provides, to our knowledge, the first in
vivo proof for self-directed tissue migration through local shaping of an
extracellular cue and provides a framework for investigating self-directed
migration in many other contexts including cancer invasion.

A heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons controls the flow of information
through a neural circuit. Inhibitory synapses that form on pyramidal neuron
dendrites modulate the summation of excitatory synaptic potentials and prevent
the generation of dendritic calcium spikes. Precisely timed somatic inhibition
limits both the number of action potentials and the time window during which
firing can occur. The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 regulates
inhibitory synapse number and function in cell culture, but how this
transcription factor affects the inhibitory inputs that form on distinct domains 
of a neuron in vivo was unclear. Here we show that in the mouse hippocampus
behaviourally driven expression of NPAS4 coordinates the redistribution of
inhibitory synapses made onto a CA1 pyramidal neuron, simultaneously increasing
inhibitory synapse number on the cell body while decreasing the number of
inhibitory synapses on the apical dendrites. This rearrangement of inhibition is 
mediated in part by the NPAS4 target gene brain derived neurotrophic factor
(Bdnf), which specifically regulates somatic, and not dendritic, inhibition.
These findings indicate that sensory stimuli, by inducing NPAS4 and its target
genes, differentially control spatial features of neuronal inhibition in a way
that restricts the output of the neuron while creating a dendritic environment
that is permissive for plasticity.

Silicate liquids play a key part at all stages of deep Earth evolution, ranging
from core and crust formation billions of years ago to present-day volcanic
activity. Quantitative models of these processes require knowledge of the
structural changes and compression mechanisms that take place in liquid silicates
at the high pressures and temperatures in the Earth's interior. However,
obtaining such knowledge has long been impeded by the challenging nature of the
experiments. In recent years, structural and density information for silica glass
was obtained at record pressures of up to 100 GPa (ref. 1), a major step towards 
obtaining data on the molten state. Here we report the structure of molten basalt
up to 60 GPa by means of in situ X-ray diffraction. The coordination of silicon
increases from four under ambient conditions to six at 35 GPa, similar to what
has been reported in silica glass. The compressibility of the melt after the
completion of the coordination change is lower than at lower pressure, implying
that only a high-order equation of state can accurately describe the density
evolution of silicate melts over the pressure range of the whole mantle. The
transition pressure coincides with a marked change in the pressure-evolution of
nickel partitioning between molten iron and molten silicates, indicating that
melt compressibility controls siderophile-element partitioning.

From the formation of animal flocks to the emergence of coordinated motion in
bacterial swarms, populations of motile organisms at all scales display coherent 
collective motion. This consistent behaviour strongly contrasts with the
difference in communication abilities between the individuals. On the basis of
this universal feature, it has been proposed that alignment rules at the
individual level could solely account for the emergence of unidirectional motion 
at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based
simulations. However, more complex collective behaviours have been systematically
found in experiments, including the formation of vortices, fluctuating swarms,
clustering and swirling. All these (living and man-made) model systems (bacteria,
biofilaments and molecular motors, shaken grains and reactive colloids)
predominantly rely on actual collisions to generate collective motion. As a
result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, and 
often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behaviour of the populations
therefore strongly depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings, which are
extremely challenging to measure and describe theoretically. Here we report that 
dilute populations of millions of colloidal rolling particles self-organize to
achieve coherent motion in a unique direction, with very few density and velocity
fluctuations. Quantitatively identifying the microscopic interactions between the
rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison
of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the
emergence of collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic
'flock', at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase, at higher
densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the
giant density fluctuations that were hitherto considered the hallmark of
populations of self-propelled particles. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine
physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous
active populations into stable directed motion.

Prefrontal cortex is thought to have a fundamental role in flexible,
context-dependent behaviour, but the exact nature of the computations underlying 
this role remains largely unknown. In particular, individual prefrontal neurons
often generate remarkably complex responses that defy deep understanding of their
contribution to behaviour. Here we study prefrontal cortex activity in macaque
monkeys trained to flexibly select and integrate noisy sensory inputs towards a
choice. We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single
neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding 
at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a
trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism
for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs. This mechanism indicates
that selection and integration are two aspects of a single dynamical process
unfolding within the same prefrontal circuits, and potentially provides a novel, 
general framework for understanding context-dependent computations.

The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud droplet concentrations and
radiative properties is the source of one of the largest uncertainties in the
radiative forcing of climate over the industrial period. This uncertainty affects
our ability to estimate how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gas emissions.
Here we perform a sensitivity analysis on a global model to quantify the
uncertainty in cloud radiative forcing over the industrial period caused by
uncertainties in aerosol emissions and processes. Our results show that 45 per
cent of the variance of aerosol forcing since about 1750 arises from
uncertainties in natural emissions of volcanic sulphur dioxide, marine
dimethylsulphide, biogenic volatile organic carbon, biomass burning and sea
spray. Only 34 per cent of the variance is associated with anthropogenic
emissions. The results point to the importance of understanding pristine
pre-industrial-like environments, with natural aerosols only, and suggest that
improved measurements and evaluation of simulated aerosols in polluted
present-day conditions will not necessarily result in commensurate reductions in 
the uncertainty of forcing estimates.

Although a prominent role for the brain in glucose homeostasis was proposed by
scientists in the nineteenth century, research throughout most of the twentieth
century focused on evidence that the function of pancreatic islets is both
necessary and sufficient to explain glucose homeostasis, and that diabetes
results from defects of insulin secretion, action or both. However,
insulin-independent mechanisms, referred to as 'glucose effectiveness', account
for roughly 50% of overall glucose disposal, and reduced glucose effectiveness
also contributes importantly to diabetes pathogenesis. Although mechanisms
underlying glucose effectiveness are poorly understood, growing evidence suggests
that the brain can dynamically regulate this process in ways that improve or even
normalize glycaemia in rodent models of diabetes. Here we present evidence of a
brain-centred glucoregulatory system (BCGS) that can lower blood glucose levels
via both insulin-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and propose a model in
which complex and highly coordinated interactions between the BCGS and pancreatic
islets promote normal glucose homeostasis. Because activation of either
regulatory system can compensate for failure of the other, defects in both may be
required for diabetes to develop. Consequently, therapies that target the BCGS in
addition to conventional approaches based on enhancing insulin effects may have
the potential to induce diabetes remission, whereas targeting just one typically 
does not.

The sensory cortex contains a wide array of neuronal types, which are connected
together into complex but partially stereotyped circuits. Sensory stimuli trigger
cascades of electrical activity through these circuits, causing specific features
of sensory scenes to be encoded in the firing patterns of cortical populations.
Recent research is beginning to reveal how the connectivity of individual neurons
relates to the sensory features they encode, how differences in the connectivity 
patterns of different cortical cell classes enable them to encode information
using different strategies, and how feedback connections from higher-order cortex
allow sensory information to be integrated with behavioural context.

To understand the processes that maintain genetic diversity is a long-standing
challenge in evolutionary biology, with implications for predicting disease
resistance, response to environmental change, and population persistence. Simple 
population genetic models are not sufficient to explain the high levels of
genetic diversity sometimes observed in ecologically important traits. In guppies
(Poecilia reticulata), male colour pattern is both diverse and heritable, and is 
arguably one of the most extreme examples of morphological polymorphism known.
Negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), a form of selection in which
genotypes are favoured when they are rare, can potentially maintain such
extensive polymorphism, but few experimental studies have confirmed its operation
in nature. Here we use highly replicated experimental manipulations of natural
populations to show that males with rare colour patterns have higher reproductive
fitness, demonstrating NFDS mediated by sexual selection. Rare males acquired
more mates and sired more offspring compared to common males and, as previously
reported, had higher rates of survival. Orange colour, implicated in other
studies of sexual selection in guppies, did predict male reproductive success,
but only in one of three populations. These data support the hypothesis that NFDS
maintains diversity in the colour patterns of male guppies through two selective 
agents, mates and predators. Similar field-based manipulations of genotype
frequencies could provide a powerful approach to reveal the underlying ecological
and behavioural mechanisms that maintain genetic and phenotypic diversity.

Neuronal dendrites are electrically excitable: they can generate regenerative
events such as dendritic spikes in response to sufficiently strong synaptic
input. Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not 
well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output 
in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal 
responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We
performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons
in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during
sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic
spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events
were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of
membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate)
receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of
subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic
regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest 
that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a
fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual
cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally
relevant computations in neurons.

Integrins have a critical role in thrombosis and haemostasis. Antagonists of the 
platelet integrin αIIbβ3 are potent anti-thrombotic drugs, but also have the
life-threatening adverse effect of causing bleeding. It is therefore desirable to
develop new antagonists that do not cause bleeding. Integrins transmit signals
bidirectionally. Inside-out signalling activates integrins through a
talin-dependent mechanism. Integrin ligation mediates thrombus formation and
outside-in signalling, which requires Gα13 and greatly expands thrombi. Here we
show that Gα13 and talin bind to mutually exclusive but distinct sites within the
integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain in opposing waves. The first talin-binding wave
mediates inside-out signalling and also ligand-induced integrin activation, but
is not required for outside-in signalling. Integrin ligation induces transient
talin dissociation and Gα13 binding to an EXE motif (in which X denotes any
residue), which selectively mediates outside-in signalling and platelet
spreading. The second talin-binding wave is associated with clot retraction. An
EXE-motif-based inhibitor of Gα13-integrin interaction selectively abolishes
outside-in signalling without affecting integrin ligation, and suppresses
occlusive arterial thrombosis without affecting bleeding time. Thus, we have
discovered a new mechanism for the directional switch of integrin signalling and,
on the basis of this mechanism, designed a potent new anti-thrombotic drug that
does not cause bleeding.

Mutations in SHANK3 and large duplications of the region spanning SHANK3 both
cause a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, indicating that proper SHANK3
dosage is critical for normal brain function. However, SHANK3 overexpression per 
se has not been established as a cause of human disorders because 22q13
duplications involve several genes. Here we report that Shank3 transgenic mice
modelling a human SHANK3 duplication exhibit manic-like behaviour and seizures
consistent with synaptic excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. We also identified two 
patients with hyperkinetic disorders carrying the smallest SHANK3-spanning
duplications reported so far. These findings indicate that SHANK3 overexpression 
causes a hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorder. To probe the mechanism
underlying the phenotype, we generated a Shank3 in vivo interactome and found
that Shank3 directly interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to increase F-actin levels
in Shank3 transgenic mice. The mood-stabilizing drug valproate, but not lithium, 
rescues the manic-like behaviour of Shank3 transgenic mice raising the
possibility that this hyperkinetic disorder has a unique pharmacogenetic profile.

Interest in assemblies of colloidal particles has long been motivated by their
applications in photonics, electronics, sensors and microlenses. Existing
assembly schemes can position colloids of one type relatively flexibly into a
range of desired structures, but it remains challenging to produce multicomponent
lattices, clusters with precisely controlled symmetries and three-dimensional
assemblies. A few schemes can efficiently produce complex colloidal structures,
but they require system-specific procedures. Here we show that magnetic field
microgradients established in a paramagnetic fluid can serve as 'virtual moulds' 
to act as templates for the assembly of large numbers (∼10(8)) of both
non-magnetic and magnetic colloidal particles with micrometre precision and
typical yields of 80 to 90 per cent. We illustrate the versatility of this
approach by producing single-component and multicomponent colloidal arrays,
complex three-dimensional structures and a variety of colloidal molecules from
polymeric particles, silica particles and live bacteria and by showing that all
of these structures can be made permanent. In addition, although our magnetic
moulds currently resemble optical traps in that they are limited to the
manipulation of micrometre-sized objects, they are massively parallel and can
manipulate non-magnetic and magnetic objects simultaneously in two and three
dimensions.

LARGE glycans on dystroglycan function as a tunable matrix scaffold to prevent
dystrophy.

The dense glycan coat that surrounds every cell is essential for cellular
development and physiological function, and it is becoming appreciated that its
composition is highly dynamic. Post-translational addition of the polysaccharide 
repeating unit [-3-xylose-α1,3-glucuronic acid-β1-]n by
like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) is required for the glycoprotein
dystroglycan to function as a receptor for proteins in the extracellular matrix. 
Reductions in the amount of [-3-xylose-α1,3-glucuronic acid-β1-]n (hereafter
referred to as LARGE-glycan) on dystroglycan result in heterogeneous forms of
muscular dystrophy. However, neither patient nor mouse studies has revealed a
clear correlation between glycosylation status and phenotype. This disparity can 
be attributed to our lack of knowledge of the cellular function of the
LARGE-glycan repeat. Here we show that coordinated upregulation of Large and
dystroglycan in differentiating mouse muscle facilitates rapid extension of
LARGE-glycan repeat chains. Using synthesized LARGE-glycan repeats we show a
direct correlation between LARGE-glycan extension and its binding capacity for
extracellular matrix ligands. Blocking Large upregulation during muscle
regeneration results in the synthesis of dystroglycan with minimal LARGE-glycan
repeats in association with a less compact basement membrane, immature
neuromuscular junctions and dysfunctional muscle predisposed to dystrophy. This
was consistent with the finding that patients with increased clinical severity of
disease have fewer LARGE-glycan repeats. Our results reveal that the LARGE-glycan
of dystroglycan serves as a tunable extracellular matrix protein scaffold, the
extension of which is required for normal skeletal muscle function.

The biogenic amine transporters (BATs) regulate endogenous neurotransmitter
concentrations and are targets for a broad range of therapeutic agents including 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake
inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Because eukaryotic BATs 
are recalcitrant to crystallographic analysis, our understanding of the mechanism
of these inhibitors and antidepressants is limited. LeuT is a bacterial homologue
of BATs and has proven to be a valuable paradigm for understanding relationships 
between their structure and function. However, because only approximately 25% of 
the amino acid sequence of LeuT is in common with that of BATs, and as LeuT is a 
promiscuous amino acid transporter, it does not recapitulate the pharmacological 
properties of BATs. Indeed, SSRIs and TCAs bind in the extracellular vestibule of
LeuT and act as non-competitive inhibitors of transport. By contrast, multiple
studies demonstrate that both TCAs and SSRIs are competitive inhibitors for
eukaryotic BATs and bind to the primary binding pocket. Here we engineered LeuT
to harbour human BAT-like pharmacology by mutating key residues around the
primary binding pocket. The final LeuBAT mutant binds the SSRI sertraline with a 
binding constant of 18 nM and displays high-affinity binding to a range of SSRIs,
SNRIs and a TCA. We determined 12 crystal structures of LeuBAT in complex with
four classes of antidepressants. The chemically diverse inhibitors have a
remarkably similar mode of binding in which they straddle transmembrane helix
(TM) 3, wedge between TM3/TM8 and TM1/TM6, and lock the transporter in a sodium- 
and chloride-bound outward-facing open conformation. Together, these studies
define common and simple principles for the action of SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs on
BATs.

Appetite suppression occurs after a meal and in conditions when it is
unfavourable to eat, such as during illness or exposure to toxins. A brain region
proposed to play a role in appetite suppression is the parabrachial nucleus, a
heterogeneous population of neurons surrounding the superior cerebellar peduncle 
in the brainstem. The parabrachial nucleus is thought to mediate the suppression 
of appetite induced by the anorectic hormones amylin and cholecystokinin, as well
as by lithium chloride and lipopolysaccharide, compounds that mimic the effects
of toxic foods and bacterial infections, respectively. Hyperactivity of the
parabrachial nucleus is also thought to cause starvation after ablation of
orexigenic agouti-related peptide neurons in adult mice. However, the identities 
of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that regulate feeding are unknown, as are 
the functionally relevant downstream projections. Here we identify calcitonin
gene-related peptide-expressing neurons in the outer external lateral subdivision
of the parabrachial nucleus that project to the laterocapsular division of the
central nucleus of the amygdala as forming a functionally important circuit for
suppressing appetite. Using genetically encoded anatomical, optogenetic and
pharmacogenetic tools, we demonstrate that activation of these neurons projecting
to the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses appetite. In contrast,
inhibition of these neurons increases food intake in circumstances when mice do
not normally eat and prevents starvation in adult mice whose agouti-related
peptide neurons are ablated. Taken together, our data demonstrate that this
neural circuit from the parabrachial nucleus to the central nucleus of the
amygdala mediates appetite suppression in conditions when it is unfavourable to
eat. This neural circuit may provide targets for therapeutic intervention to
overcome or promote appetite.

In systemic sclerosis (SSc), a common and aetiologically mysterious form of
scleroderma (defined as pathological fibrosis of the skin), previously healthy
adults acquire fibrosis of the skin and viscera in association with
autoantibodies. Familial recurrence is extremely rare and causal genes have not
been identified. Although the onset of fibrosis in SSc typically correlates with 
the production of autoantibodies, whether they contribute to disease pathogenesis
or simply serve as a marker of disease remains controversial and the mechanism
for their induction is largely unknown. The study of SSc is hindered by a lack of
animal models that recapitulate the aetiology of this complex disease. To gain a 
foothold in the pathogenesis of pathological skin fibrosis, we studied stiff skin
syndrome (SSS), a rare but tractable Mendelian disorder leading to childhood
onset of diffuse skin fibrosis with autosomal dominant inheritance and complete
penetrance. We showed previously that SSS is caused by heterozygous missense
mutations in the gene (FBN1) encoding fibrillin-1, the main constituent of
extracellular microfibrils. SSS mutations all localize to the only domain in
fibrillin-1 that harbours an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif needed to mediate
cell-matrix interactions by binding to cell-surface integrins. Here we show that 
mouse lines harbouring analogous amino acid substitutions in fibrillin-1
recapitulate aggressive skin fibrosis that is prevented by integrin-modulating
therapies and reversed by antagonism of the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming
growth factor β (TGF-β). Mutant mice show skin infiltration of pro-inflammatory
immune cells including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, T helper cells and plasma
cells, and also autoantibody production; these findings are normalized by
integrin-modulating therapies or TGF-β antagonism. These results show that
alterations in cell-matrix interactions are sufficient to initiate and sustain
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic programmes and highlight new therapeutic
strategies.

The enormous size and cost of current state-of-the-art accelerators based on
conventional radio-frequency technology has spawned great interest in the
development of new acceleration concepts that are more compact and economical.
Micro-fabricated dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) are an attractive approach,
because such dielectric microstructures can support accelerating fields one to
two orders of magnitude higher than can radio-frequency cavity-based
accelerators. DLAs use commercial lasers as a power source, which are smaller and
less expensive than the radio-frequency klystrons that power today's
accelerators. In addition, DLAs are fabricated via low-cost, lithographic
techniques that can be used for mass production. However, despite several DLA
structures having been proposed recently, no successful demonstration of
acceleration in these structures has so far been shown. Here we report
high-gradient (beyond 250 MeV m(-1)) acceleration of electrons in a DLA.
Relativistic (60-MeV) electrons are energy-modulated over 563 ± 104 optical
periods of a fused silica grating structure, powered by a 800-nm-wavelength
mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. The observed results are in agreement with
analytical models and electrodynamic simulations. By comparison, conventional
modern linear accelerators operate at gradients of 10-30 MeV m(-1), and the first
linear radio-frequency cavity accelerator was ten radio-frequency periods (one
metre) long with a gradient of approximately 1.6 MeV m(-1) (ref. 5). Our results 
set the stage for the development of future multi-staged DLA devices composed of 
integrated on-chip systems. This would enable compact table-top accelerators on
the MeV-GeV (10(6)-10(9) eV) scale for security scanners and medical therapy,
university-scale X-ray light sources for biological and materials research, and
portable medical imaging devices, and would substantially reduce the size and
cost of a future collider on the multi-TeV (10(12) eV) scale.

Antidepressants targeting Na(+)/Cl(-)-coupled neurotransmitter uptake define a
key therapeutic strategy to treat clinical depression and neuropathic pain.
However, identifying the molecular interactions that underlie the pharmacological
activity of these transport inhibitors, and thus the mechanism by which the
inhibitors lead to increased synaptic neurotransmitter levels, has proven
elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster
dopamine transporter at 3.0 Å resolution bound to the tricyclic antidepressant
nortriptyline. The transporter is locked in an outward-open conformation with
nortriptyline wedged between transmembrane helices 1, 3, 6 and 8, blocking the
transporter from binding substrate and from isomerizing to an inward-facing
conformation. Although the overall structure of the dopamine transporter is
similar to that of its prokaryotic relative LeuT, there are multiple
distinctions, including a kink in transmembrane helix 12 halfway across the
membrane bilayer, a latch-like carboxy-terminal helix that caps the cytoplasmic
gate, and a cholesterol molecule wedged within a groove formed by transmembrane

The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are
interlinked by primary production, respiration and decomposition in terrestrial
ecosystems. It has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become
uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different degrees of control 
exerted on the supply of these elements by biological and geochemical processes. 
Climatic controls on biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid,
semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because their biological
activity is mainly driven by water availability. The increase in aridity
predicted for the twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide may therefore
threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially affecting the
availability of essential nutrients. Here we evaluate how aridity affects the
balance between C, N and P in soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all
continents except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the
concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive effect on the
concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is negatively related to plant cover, which
may favour the dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a major
source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes that provide more C and N,
such as litter decomposition. Our findings suggest that any predicted increase in
aridity with climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N and C in
global drylands, but increase that of P. These changes would uncouple the C, N
and P cycles in drylands and could negatively affect the provision of key
services provided by these ecosystems.

Gradual demise of a thin southern Laurentide ice sheet recorded by Mississippi
drainage.

At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), about 21,000 years before present, land-based 
ice sheets held enough water to reduce global mean sea level by 130 metres. Yet
after decades of study, major uncertainties remain as to the distribution of that
ice. Here we test four reconstructions of North American deglacial ice-sheet
history by quantitatively connecting them to high-resolution oxygen isotope
(δ(18)O) records from the Gulf of Mexico using a water mixing model. For each
reconstruction, we route meltwater and seasonal runoff through the time-evolving 
Mississippi drainage basin, which co-evolves with ice geometry and changing
topography as ice loads deform the solid Earth and produce spatially variable sea
level in a process known as glacial isostatic adjustment. The δ(18)O records show
that the Mississippi-drained southern Laurentide ice sheet contributed only
5.4 ± 2.1 metres to global sea level rise, of which 0.66 ± 0.07 metres were
released during the meltwater pulse 1A event 14,650-14,310 years before present, 
far less water than previously thought. In contrast, the three reconstructions
based on glacial isostatic adjustment overpredict the δ(18)O-based post-LGM
meltwater volume by a factor of 1.6 to 3.6. The fourth reconstruction, which is
based on ice physics, has a low enough Mississippi-routed meltwater discharge to 
be consistent with δ(18)O constraints, but also contains the largest LGM North
American ice volume. This suggests that modelling based on ice physics may be the
best way of matching isotopic records while also sequestering enough water in the
North American ice sheets to match the observed LGM sea level fall.

The coupling of electrons to matter lies at the heart of our understanding of
material properties such as electrical conductivity. Electron-phonon coupling can
lead to the formation of a Cooper pair out of two repelling electrons, which
forms the basis for Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity. Here we study
the interaction of a single localized electron with a Bose-Einstein condensate
and show that the electron can excite phonons and eventually trigger a collective
oscillation of the whole condensate. We find that the coupling is surprisingly
strong compared to that of ionic impurities, owing to the more favourable mass
ratio. The electron is held in place by a single charged ionic core, forming a
Rydberg bound state. This Rydberg electron is described by a wavefunction
extending to a size of up to eight micrometres, comparable to the dimensions of
the condensate. In such a state, corresponding to a principal quantum number of n
= 202, the Rydberg electron is interacting with several tens of thousands of
condensed atoms contained within its orbit. We observe surprisingly long
lifetimes and finite size effects caused by the electron exploring the outer
regions of the condensate. We anticipate future experiments on electron orbital
imaging, the investigation of phonon-mediated coupling of single electrons, and
applications in quantum optics.

A uniform metal distribution in the intergalactic medium of the Perseus cluster
of galaxies.

Most of the metals (elements heavier than helium) produced by stars in the member
galaxies of clusters currently reside within the hot, X-ray-emitting
intra-cluster gas. Observations of X-ray line emission from this intergalactic
medium have suggested a relatively small cluster-to-cluster scatter outside the
cluster centres and enrichment with iron out to large radii, leading to the idea 
that the metal enrichment occurred early in the history of the Universe. Models
with early enrichment predict a uniform metal distribution at large radii in
clusters, whereas those with late-time enrichment are expected to introduce
significant spatial variations of the metallicity. To discriminate clearly
between these competing models, it is essential to test for potential
inhomogeneities by measuring the abundances out to large radii along multiple
directions in clusters, which has not hitherto been done. Here we report a
remarkably uniform iron abundance, as a function of radius and azimuth, that is
statistically consistent with a constant value of ZFe = 0.306 ± 0.012 in solar
units out to the edge of the nearby Perseus cluster. This homogeneous
distribution requires that most of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic
medium occurred before the cluster formed, probably more than ten billion years
ago, during the period of maximal star formation and black hole activity.

Globally, reef-building corals are the most prolific producers of
dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), a central molecule in the marine sulphur
cycle and precursor of the climate-active gas dimethylsulphide. At present, DMSP 
production by corals is attributed entirely to their algal endosymbiont,
Symbiodinium. Combining chemical, genomic and molecular approaches, we show that 
coral juveniles produce DMSP in the absence of algal symbionts. DMSP levels
increased up to 54% over time in newly settled coral juveniles lacking algal
endosymbionts, and further increases, up to 76%, were recorded when juveniles
were subjected to thermal stress. We uncovered coral orthologues of two algal
genes recently identified in DMSP biosynthesis, strongly indicating that corals
possess the enzymatic machinery necessary for DMSP production. Our results
overturn the paradigm that photosynthetic organisms are the sole biological
source of DMSP, and highlight the double jeopardy represented by worldwide
declining coral cover, as the potential to alleviate thermal stress through
coral-produced DMSP declines correspondingly.

Circadian clocks provide a competitive advantage in an environment that is
heavily influenced by the rotation of the Earth, by driving daily rhythms in
behaviour, physiology and metabolism in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Circadian clocks comprise transcription-translation feedback loops, which are
entrained by environmental signals such as light and temperature to adjust the
phase of rhythms to match the local environment. The production of sugars by
photosynthesis is a key metabolic output of the circadian clock in plants. Here
we show that these rhythmic, endogenous sugar signals can entrain circadian
rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating the gene expression of circadian
clock components early in the photoperiod, thus defining a 'metabolic dawn'. By
inhibiting photosynthesis, we demonstrate that endogenous oscillations in sugar
levels provide metabolic feedback to the circadian oscillator through the
morning-expressed gene PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7), and we identify that
prr7 mutants are insensitive to the effects of sucrose on the circadian period.
Thus, photosynthesis has a marked effect on the entrainment and maintenance of
robust circadian rhythms in A. thaliana, demonstrating that metabolism has a
crucial role in regulation of the circadian clock.

Kramers developed the theory on how chemical reaction rates are influenced by the
viscosity of the medium. At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular 
reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy
barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous 
theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in
physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein
folding. Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by
the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties 
have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the
Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by
measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time
for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium 
trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two
states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be
determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing
folding/unfolding transitions. Our finding of a long transition path time with an
unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as
well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for
α-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for
many small-molecule reactions. It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental
information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings
obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler
chemical or physical system.

Protein biosynthesis depends on the availability of ribosomes, which in turn
relies on ribosomal RNA production. In eukaryotes, this process is carried out by
RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a 14-subunit enzyme, the activity of which is a major
determinant of cell growth. Here we present the crystal structure of Pol I from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 3.0 Å resolution. The Pol I structure shows a compact
core with a wide DNA-binding cleft and a tightly anchored stalk. An extended loop
mimics the DNA backbone in the cleft and may be involved in regulating Pol I
transcription. Subunit A12.2 extends from the A190 jaw to the active site and
inserts a transcription elongation factor TFIIS-like zinc ribbon into the
nucleotide triphosphate entry pore, providing insight into the role of A12.2 in
RNA cleavage and Pol I insensitivity to α-amanitin. The A49-A34.5 heterodimer
embraces subunit A135 through extended arms, thereby contacting and potentially
regulating subunit A12.2.

Transcription of ribosomal RNA by RNA polymerase (Pol) I initiates ribosome
biogenesis and regulates eukaryotic cell growth. The crystal structure of Pol I
from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2.8 Å resolution reveals all
14 subunits of the 590-kilodalton enzyme, and shows differences to Pol II. An
'expander' element occupies the DNA template site and stabilizes an expanded
active centre cleft with an unwound bridge helix. A 'connector' element invades
the cleft of an adjacent polymerase and stabilizes an inactive polymerase dimer. 
The connector and expander must detach during Pol I activation to enable
transcription initiation and cleft contraction by convergent movement of the
polymerase 'core' and 'shelf' modules. Conversion between an inactive expanded
and an active contracted polymerase state may generally underlie transcription.
Regulatory factors can modulate the core-shelf interface that includes a
'composite' active site for RNA chain initiation, elongation, proofreading and
termination.

The on-demand generation of pure quantum excitations is important for the
operation of quantum systems, but it is particularly difficult for a system of
fermions. This is because any perturbation affects all states below the Fermi
energy, resulting in a complex superposition of particle and hole excitations.
However, it was predicted nearly 20 years ago that a Lorentzian time-dependent
potential with quantized flux generates a minimal excitation with only one
particle and no hole. Here we report that such quasiparticles (hereafter termed
levitons) can be generated on demand in a conductor by applying voltage pulses to
a contact. Partitioning the excitations with an electronic beam splitter
generates a current noise that we use to measure their number. Minimal-excitation
states are observed for Lorentzian pulses, whereas for other pulse shapes there
are significant contributions from holes. Further identification of levitons is
provided in the energy domain with shot-noise spectroscopy, and in the time
domain with electronic Hong-Ou-Mandel noise correlations. The latter, obtained by
colliding synchronized levitons on a beam splitter, exemplifies the potential use
of levitons for quantum information: using linear electron quantum optics in
ballistic conductors, it is possible to imagine flying-qubit operation in which
the Fermi statistics are exploited to entangle synchronized electrons emitted by 
distinct sources. Compared with electron sources based on quantum dots, the
generation of levitons does not require delicate nanolithography, considerably
simplifying the circuitry for scalability. Levitons are not limited to carrying a
single charge, and so in a broader context n-particle levitons could find
application in the study of full electron counting statistics. But they can also 
carry a fraction of charge if they are implemented in Luttinger liquids or in
fractional quantum Hall edge channels; this allows the study of Abelian and
non-Abelian quasiparticles in the time domain. Finally, the generation technique 
could be applied to cold atomic gases, leading to the possibility of atomic
levitons.

Cell cycle quiescence is a critical feature contributing to haematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) maintenance. Although various candidate stromal cells have been
identified as potential HSC niches, the spatial localization of quiescent HSCs in
the bone marrow remains unclear. Here, using a novel approach that combines
whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence imaging techniques and computational
modelling to analyse significant three-dimensional associations in the mouse bone
marrow among vascular structures, stromal cells and HSCs, we show that quiescent 
HSCs associate specifically with small arterioles that are preferentially found
in endosteal bone marrow. These arterioles are ensheathed exclusively by rare NG2
(also known as CSPG4)(+) pericytes, distinct from sinusoid-associated leptin
receptor (LEPR)(+) cells. Pharmacological or genetic activation of the HSC cell
cycle alters the distribution of HSCs from NG2(+) periarteriolar niches to
LEPR(+) perisinusoidal niches. Conditional depletion of NG2(+) cells induces HSC 
cycling and reduces functional long-term repopulating HSCs in the bone marrow.
These results thus indicate that arteriolar niches are indispensable for
maintaining HSC quiescence.

Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms responsible for ∼25% of organic carbon
fixation on the Earth. These bacteria began to convert solar energy and carbon
dioxide into bioenergy and oxygen more than two billion years ago. Cyanophages,
which infect these bacteria, have an important role in regulating the marine
ecosystem by controlling cyanobacteria community organization and mediating
lateral gene transfer. Here we visualize the maturation process of cyanophage
Syn5 inside its host cell, Synechococcus, using Zernike phase contrast electron
cryo-tomography (cryoET). This imaging modality yields dramatic enhancement of
image contrast over conventional cryoET and thus facilitates the direct
identification of subcellular components, including thylakoid membranes,
carboxysomes and polyribosomes, as well as phages, inside the congested cytosol
of the infected cell. By correlating the structural features and relative
abundance of viral progeny within cells at different stages of infection, we
identify distinct Syn5 assembly intermediates. Our results indicate that the
procapsid releases scaffolding proteins and expands its volume at an early stage 
of genome packaging. Later in the assembly process, we detected full particles
with a tail either with or without an additional horn. The morphogenetic pathway 
we describe here is highly conserved and was probably established long before
that of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting more complex organisms.

Crossover recombination events between homologous chromosomes are required to
form chiasmata, temporary connections between homologues that ensure their proper
segregation at meiosis I. Despite this requirement for crossovers and an excess
of the double-strand DNA breaks that are the initiating events for meiotic
recombination, most organisms make very few crossovers per chromosome pair.
Moreover, crossovers tend to inhibit the formation of other crossovers nearby on 
the same chromosome pair, a poorly understood phenomenon known as crossover
interference. Here we show that the synaptonemal complex, a meiosis-specific
structure that assembles between aligned homologous chromosomes, both constrains 
and is altered by crossover recombination events. Using a cytological marker of
crossover sites in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that partial depletion of the 
synaptonemal complex central region proteins attenuates crossover interference,
increasing crossovers and reducing the effective distance over which interference
operates, indicating that synaptonemal complex proteins limit crossovers.
Moreover, we show that crossovers are associated with a local 0.4-0.5-micrometre 
increase in chromosome axis length. We propose that meiotic crossover regulation 
operates as a self-limiting system in which meiotic chromosome structures
establish an environment that promotes crossover formation, which in turn alters 
chromosome structure to inhibit other crossovers at additional sites.

Magnetotactic bacteria align along the Earth's magnetic field using an organelle 
called the magnetosome, a biomineralized magnetite (Fe(II)Fe(III)2O4) or greigite
(Fe(II)Fe(III)2S4) crystal embedded in a lipid vesicle. Although the need for
both iron(II) and iron(III) is clear, little is known about the biological
mechanisms controlling their ratio. Here we present the structure of the
magnetosome-associated protein MamP and find that it is built on a unique
arrangement of a self-plugged PDZ domain fused to two magnetochrome domains,
defining a new class of c-type cytochrome exclusively found in magnetotactic
bacteria. Mutational analysis, enzyme kinetics, co-crystallization with iron(II) 
and an in vitro MamP-assisted magnetite production assay establish MamP as an
iron oxidase that contributes to the formation of iron(III) ferrihydrite
eventually required for magnetite crystal growth in vivo. These results
demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of iron management taking place inside the
magnetosome and highlight the role of magnetochrome in iron biomineralization.

Glycolysis, or its variations, is a fundamental metabolic pathway in life that
functions in almost all organisms to decompose external or intracellular sugars. 
The pathway involves the partial oxidation and splitting of sugars to pyruvate,
which in turn is decarboxylated to produce acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) for various
biosynthetic purposes. The decarboxylation of pyruvate loses a carbon equivalent,
and limits the theoretical carbon yield to only two moles of two-carbon (C2)
metabolites per mole of hexose. This native route is a major source of carbon
loss in biorefining and microbial carbon metabolism. Here we design and construct
a non-oxidative, cyclic pathway that allows the production of stoichiometric
amounts of C2 metabolites from hexose, pentose and triose phosphates without
carbon loss. We tested this pathway, termed non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG), in
vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli. NOG enables complete carbon conservation
in sugar catabolism to acetyl-CoA, and can be used in conjunction with CO2
fixation and other one-carbon (C1) assimilation pathways to achieve a 100% carbon
yield to desirable fuels and chemicals.

Assigning valid functions to proteins identified in genome projects is
challenging: overprediction and database annotation errors are the principal
concerns. We and others are developing computation-guided strategies for
functional discovery with 'metabolite docking' to experimentally derived or
homology-based three-dimensional structures. Bacterial metabolic pathways often
are encoded by 'genome neighbourhoods' (gene clusters and/or operons), which can 
provide important clues for functional assignment. We recently demonstrated the
synergy of docking and pathway context by 'predicting' the intermediates in the
glycolytic pathway in Escherichia coli. Metabolite docking to multiple binding
proteins and enzymes in the same pathway increases the reliability of in silico
predictions of substrate specificities because the pathway intermediates are
structurally similar. Here we report that structure-guided approaches for
predicting the substrate specificities of several enzymes encoded by a bacterial 
gene cluster allowed the correct prediction of the in vitro activity of a
structurally characterized enzyme of unknown function (PDB 2PMQ), 2-epimerization
of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline betaine (tHyp-B) and cis-4-hydroxy-D-proline betaine
(cHyp-B), and also the correct identification of the catabolic pathway in which
Hyp-B 2-epimerase participates. The substrate-liganded pose predicted by virtual 
library screening (docking) was confirmed experimentally. The enzymatic
activities in the predicted pathway were confirmed by in vitro assays and genetic
analyses; the intermediates were identified by metabolomics; and repression of
the genes encoding the pathway by high salt concentrations was established by
transcriptomics, confirming the osmolyte role of tHyp-B. This study establishes
the utility of structure-guided functional predictions to enable the discovery of
new metabolic pathways.

Food intake increases the activity of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which mediates
the conversion of glucose to fats for storage or use. In mice, this program
follows a circadian rhythm that peaks with nocturnal feeding and is repressed by 
Rev-erbα/β and an HDAC3-containing complex during the day. The transcriptional
activators controlling rhythmic lipid synthesis in the dark cycle remain poorly
defined. Disturbances in hepatic lipogenesis are also associated with systemic
metabolic phenotypes, suggesting that lipogenesis in the liver communicates with 
peripheral tissues to control energy substrate homeostasis. Here we identify a
PPARδ-dependent de novo lipogenic pathway in the liver that modulates fat use by 
muscle via a circulating lipid. The nuclear receptor PPARδ controls diurnal
expression of lipogenic genes in the dark/feeding cycle. Liver-specific PPARδ
activation increases, whereas hepatocyte-Ppard deletion reduces, muscle fatty
acid uptake. Unbiased metabolite profiling identifies phosphatidylcholine
18:0/18:1 (PC(18:0/18:1) as a serum lipid regulated by diurnal hepatic PPARδ
activity. PC(18:0/18:1) reduces postprandial lipid levels and increases fatty
acid use through muscle PPARα. High-fat feeding diminishes rhythmic production of
PC(18:0/18:1), whereas PC(18:0/18:1) administration in db/db mice (also known as 
Lepr(-/-)) improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings reveal an integrated
regulatory circuit coupling lipid synthesis in the liver to energy use in muscle 
by coordinating the activity of two closely related nuclear receptors. These data
implicate alterations in diurnal hepatic PPARδ-PC(18:0/18:1) signalling in
metabolic disorders, including obesity.

More than 85 per cent of all chemical industry products are made using catalysts,
the overwhelming majority of which are heterogeneous catalysts that function at
the gas-solid interface. Consequently, much effort is invested in optimizing the 
design of catalytic reactors, usually by modelling the coupling between heat
transfer, fluid dynamics and surface reaction kinetics. The complexity involved
requires a calibration of model approximations against experimental observations,
with temperature maps being particularly valuable because temperature control is 
often essential for optimal operation and because temperature gradients contain
information about the energetics of a reaction. However, it is challenging to
probe the behaviour of a gas inside a reactor without disturbing its flow,
particularly when trying also to map the physical parameters and gradients that
dictate heat and mass flow and catalytic efficiency. Although optical techniques 
and sensors have been used for that purpose, the former perform poorly in opaque 
media and the latter perturb the flow. NMR thermometry can measure temperature
non-invasively, but traditional approaches applied to gases produce signals that 
depend only weakly on temperature are rapidly attenuated by diffusion or require 
contrast agents that may interfere with reactions. Here we present a new NMR
thermometry technique that circumvents these problems by exploiting the inverse
relationship between NMR linewidths and temperature caused by motional averaging 
in a weak magnetic field gradient. We demonstrate the concept by non-invasively
mapping gas temperatures during the hydrogenation of propylene in reactors packed
with metal nanoparticles and metal-organic framework catalysts, with measurement 
errors of less than four per cent of the absolute temperature. These results
establish our technique as a non-invasive tool for locating hot and cold spots in
catalyst-packed gas-solid reactors, with unprecedented capabilities for testing
the approximations used in reactor modelling.

Of several dozen galaxies observed spectroscopically that are candidates for
having a redshift (z) in excess of seven, only five have had their redshifts
confirmed via Lyman α emission, at z = 7.008, 7.045, 7.109, 7.213 and 7.215 (refs
1-4). The small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicate that the neutral
fraction in the intergalactic medium rises quickly at z > 6.5, given that Lyman α
is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. The small samples and limited depth of
previous observations, however, makes these conclusions tentative. Here we report
a deep near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 43 photometrically-selected galaxies
with z > 6.5. We detect a near-infrared emission line from only a single galaxy, 
confirming that some process is making Lyman α difficult to detect. The detected 
emission line at a wavelength of 1.0343 micrometres is likely to be Lyman α
emission, placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years 
after the Big Bang. This galaxy's colours are consistent with significant metal
content, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. We calculate a
surprisingly high star-formation rate of about 330 solar masses per year, which
is more than a factor of 100 greater than that seen in the Milky Way. Such a
galaxy is unexpected in a survey of our size, suggesting that the early Universe 
may harbour a larger number of intense sites of star formation than expected.

How a complex animal can arise from a fertilized egg is one of the oldest and
most fascinating questions of biology, the answer to which is encoded in the
genome. Body shape and organ development, and their integration into a functional
organism all depend on the precise expression of genes in space and time. The
orchestration of transcription relies mostly on surrounding control sequences
such as enhancers, millions of which form complex regulatory landscapes in the
non-coding genome. Recent research shows that high-order chromosome structures
make an important contribution to enhancer functionality by triggering their
physical interactions with target genes.

Living organisms and individual cells continuously adapt to changes in their
environment. Those changes are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the
availability of energy substrates. The cellular transcriptional machinery and its
chromatin-associated proteins integrate environmental inputs to mediate
homeostatic responses through gene regulation. Numerous connections between
products of intermediary metabolism and chromatin proteins have recently been
identified. Chromatin modifications that occur in response to metabolic signals
are dynamic or stable and might even be inherited transgenerationally. These
emerging concepts have biological relevance to tissue homeostasis, disease and
ageing.

A plethora of groundbreaking studies have demonstrated the importance of
chromatin-associated proteins and post-translational modifications of histones,
proteins and DNA (so-called epigenetic modifications) for transcriptional control
and normal development. Disruption of epigenetic control is a frequent event in
disease, and the first epigenetic-based therapies for cancer treatment have been 
approved. A generation of new classes of potent and specific inhibitors for
several chromatin-associated proteins have shown promise in preclinical trials.
Although the biology of epigenetic regulation is complex, new inhibitors such as 
these will hopefully be of clinical use in the coming years.

DNA methylation has a profound impact on genome stability, transcription and
development. Although enzymes that catalyse DNA methylation have been well
characterized, those that are involved in methyl group removal have remained
elusive, until recently. The transformative discovery that ten-eleven
translocation (TET) family enzymes can oxidize 5-methylcytosine has greatly
advanced our understanding of DNA demethylation. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine is a key
nexus in demethylation that can either be passively depleted through DNA
replication or actively reverted to cytosine through iterative oxidation and
thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG)-mediated base excision repair. Methylation,
oxidation and repair now offer a model for a complete cycle of dynamic cytosine
modification, with mounting evidence for its significance in the biological
processes known to involve active demethylation.

Induced pluripotency is a powerful tool to derive patient-specific stem cells. In
addition, it provides a unique assay to study the interplay between transcription
factors and chromatin structure. Here, we review the latest insights into
chromatin dynamics that are inherent to induced pluripotency. Moreover, we
compare and contrast these events with other physiological and pathological
processes that involve changes in chromatin and cell state, including germ cell
maturation and tumorigenesis. We propose that an integrated view of these
seemingly diverse processes could provide mechanistic insights into cell fate
transitions in general and might lead to new approaches in regenerative medicine 
and cancer treatment.

Conodonts are an extinct group of jawless vertebrates whose tooth-like elements
are the earliest instance of a mineralized skeleton in the vertebrate lineage,
inspiring the 'inside-out' hypothesis that teeth evolved independently of the
vertebrate dermal skeleton and before the origin of jaws. However, these
propositions have been based on evidence from derived euconodonts. Here we test
hypotheses of a paraconodont ancestry of euconodonts using synchrotron radiation 
X-ray tomographic microscopy to characterize and compare the microstructure of
morphologically similar euconodont and paraconodont elements. Paraconodonts
exhibit a range of grades of structural differentiation, including tissues and a 
pattern of growth common to euconodont basal bodies. The different grades of
structural differentiation exhibited by paraconodonts demonstrate the stepwise
acquisition of euconodont characters, resolving debate over the relationship
between these two groups. By implication, the putative homology of euconodont
crown tissue and vertebrate enamel must be rejected as these tissues have evolved
independently and convergently. Thus, the precise ontogenetic, structural and
topological similarities between conodont elements and vertebrate odontodes
appear to be a remarkable instance of convergence. The last common ancestor of
conodonts and jawed vertebrates probably lacked mineralized skeletal tissues. The
hypothesis that teeth evolved before jaws and the inside-out hypothesis of dental
evolution must be rejected; teeth seem to have evolved through the extension of
odontogenic competence from the external dermis to internal epithelium soon after
the origin of jaws.

The miniaturization and integration of frequency-agile microwave
circuits--relevant to electronically tunable filters, antennas, resonators and
phase shifters--with microelectronics offers tantalizing device possibilities,
yet requires thin films whose dielectric constant at gigahertz frequencies can be
tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field. Appropriate systems such as
BaxSr1-xTiO3 have a paraelectric-ferroelectric transition just below ambient
temperature, providing high tunability. Unfortunately, such films suffer
significant losses arising from defects. Recognizing that progress is stymied by 
dielectric loss, we start with a system with exceptionally low
loss--Srn+1TinO3n+1 phases--in which (SrO)2 crystallographic shear planes provide
an alternative to the formation of point defects for accommodating
non-stoichiometry. Here we report the experimental realization of a highly
tunable ground state arising from the emergence of a local ferroelectric
instability in biaxially strained Srn+1TinO3n+1 phases with n ≥ 3 at frequencies 
up to 125 GHz. In contrast to traditional methods of modifying
ferroelectrics-doping or strain-in this unique system an increase in the
separation between the (SrO)2 planes, which can be achieved by changing n,
bolsters the local ferroelectric instability. This new control parameter, n, can 
be exploited to achieve a figure of merit at room temperature that rivals all
known tunable microwave dielectrics.

HIV-1 replication can be inhibited by type I interferon (IFN), and the expression
of a number of gene products with anti-HIV-1 activity is induced by type I IFN.
However, none of the known antiretroviral proteins can account for the ability of
type I IFN to inhibit early, preintegration phases of the HIV-1 replication cycle
in human cells. Here, by comparing gene expression profiles in cell lines that
differ in their ability to support the inhibitory action of IFN-α at early steps 
of the HIV-1 replication cycle, we identify myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2) as an
interferon-induced inhibitor of HIV-1 infection. Expression of MX2 reduces
permissiveness to a variety of lentiviruses, whereas depletion of MX2 using RNA
interference reduces the anti-HIV-1 potency of IFN-α. HIV-1 reverse transcription
proceeds normally in MX2-expressing cells, but 2-long terminal repeat circular
forms of HIV-1 DNA are less abundant, suggesting that MX2 inhibits HIV-1 nuclear 
import, or destabilizes nuclear HIV-1 DNA. Consistent with this notion, mutations
in the HIV-1 capsid protein that are known, or suspected, to alter the nuclear
import pathways used by HIV-1 confer resistance to MX2, whereas preventing cell
division increases MX2 potency. Overall, these findings indicate that MX2 is an
effector of the anti-HIV-1 activity of type-I IFN, and suggest that MX2 inhibits 
HIV-1 infection by inhibiting capsid-dependent nuclear import of subviral
complexes.

Robust twenty-first-century projections of El Niño and related precipitation
variability.

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in
rainfall, severe weather, agricultural production, ecosystems and disease in many
parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's
climate system seem inevitable, the possibility exists that the character of ENSO
and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has
been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little
consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will
continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability. Here we show that
there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of
year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and
precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of
climate models, using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively
active gases. By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include
an intensification of both El-Niño-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and
rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments
with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected
changes in precipitation anomalies during El Niño years are primarily determined 
by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in
the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a
secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently
much clearer than previously realized.

Post-transcriptional modifications are essential to the cell life cycle, as they 
affect both pre-ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly. The box C/D
ribonucleoprotein enzyme that methylates ribosomal RNA at the 2'-O-ribose uses a 
multitude of guide RNAs as templates for the recognition of rRNA target sites.
Two methylation guide sequences are combined on each guide RNA, the significance 
of which has remained unclear. Here we use a powerful combination of NMR
spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering to solve the structure of the
390 kDa archaeal RNP enzyme bound to substrate RNA. We show that the two
methylation guide sequences are located in different environments in the complex 
and that the methylation of physiological substrates targeted by the same guide
RNA occurs sequentially. This structure provides a means for differential control
of methylation levels at the two sites and at the same time offers an unexpected 
regulatory mechanism for rRNA folding.

Stem-cell niches in mammalian tissues are often heterogeneous and
compartmentalized; however, whether distinct niche locations determine different 
stem-cell fates remains unclear. To test this hypothesis, here we use the mouse
hair follicle niche and combine intravital microscopy with genetic lineage
tracing to re-visit the same stem-cell lineages, from their exact place of
origin, throughout regeneration in live mice. Using this method, we show directly
that the position of a stem cell within the hair follicle niche can predict
whether it is likely to remain uncommitted, generate precursors or commit to a
differentiated fate. Furthermore, using laser ablation we demonstrate that hair
follicle stem cells are dispensable for regeneration, and that epithelial cells, 
which do not normally participate in hair growth, re-populate the lost stem-cell 
compartment and sustain hair regeneration. This study provides a general model
for niche-induced fate determination in adult tissues.

In most eukaryotic cells microtubules undergo post-translational modifications
such as acetylation of α-tubulin on lysine 40, a widespread modification
restricted to a subset of microtubules that turns over slowly. This subset of
stable microtubules accumulates in cell protrusions and regulates cell
polarization, migration and invasion. However, mechanisms restricting acetylation
to these microtubules are unknown. Here we report that clathrin-coated pits
(CCPs) control microtubule acetylation through a direct interaction of the
α-tubulin acetyltransferase αTAT1 (refs 8, 9) with the clathrin adaptor AP2. We
observe that about one-third of growing microtubule ends contact and pause at
CCPs and that loss of CCPs decreases lysine 40 acetylation levels. We show that
αTAT1 localizes to CCPs through a direct interaction with AP2 that is required
for microtubule acetylation. In migrating cells, the polarized orientation of
acetylated microtubules correlates with CCP accumulation at the leading edge, and
interaction of αTAT1 with AP2 is required for directional migration. We conclude 
that microtubules contacting CCPs become acetylated by αTAT1. In migrating cells,
this mechanism ensures the acetylation of microtubules oriented towards the
leading edge, thus promoting directional cell locomotion and chemotaxis.

The physics of the superconducting state in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems
is relevant to understanding the high-transition-temperature copper oxide
superconductors and for the development of future superconductors based on
interface electron systems. But it is not yet understood how fundamental
superconducting parameters, such as the spectral density of states, change when
these superconducting electron systems are depleted of charge carriers. Here we
use tunnel spectroscopy with planar junctions to measure the behaviour of the
electronic spectral density of states as a function of carrier density,
clarifying this issue experimentally. We chose the conducting LaAlO3-SrTiO3
interface as the 2D superconductor, because this electron system can be tuned
continuously with an electric gate field. We observed an energy gap of the order 
of 40 microelectronvolts in the density of states, whose shape is well described 
by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconducting gap function. In contrast to the
dome-shaped dependence of the critical temperature, the gap increases with charge
carrier depletion in both the underdoped region and the overdoped region. These
results are analogous to the pseudogap behaviour of the
high-transition-temperature copper oxide superconductors and imply that the
smooth continuation of the superconducting gap into pseudogap-like behaviour
could be a general property of 2D superconductivity.

There are major impediments to finding improved DEET alternatives because the
receptors causing olfactory repellency are unknown, and new chemicals require
exorbitant costs to determine safety for human use. Here we identify
DEET-sensitive neurons in a pit-like structure in the Drosophila melanogaster
antenna called the sacculus. They express a highly conserved receptor, Ir40a, and
flies in which these neurons are silenced or Ir40a is knocked down lose avoidance
to DEET. We used a computational structure-activity screen of >400,000 compounds 
that identified >100 natural compounds as candidate repellents. We tested several
and found that most activate Ir40a(+) neurons and are repellents for Drosophila. 
These compounds are also strong repellents for mosquitoes. The candidates contain
chemicals that do not dissolve plastic, are affordable and smell mildly like
grapes, with three considered safe in human foods. Our findings pave the way to
discover new generations of repellents that will help fight deadly insect-borne
diseases worldwide.

Microbial production of short-chain alkanes.

Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems 
have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable
resources. Although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production 
of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been
demonstrated. Here we report the development of platform Escherichia coli strains
that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (SCAs; petrol), free fatty
acids (FFAs), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl
carrier protein (ACP)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-CoA pathway. First, the
β-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fadE gene to prevent the
degradation of fatty acyl-CoAs generated in vivo. To increase the formation of
short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to SCAs in vivo, the
activity of 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH), which is inhibited by unsaturated
fatty acyl-ACPs, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid
biosynthesis by deleting the fadR gene; deletion of the fadR gene prevents
upregulation of the fabA and fabB genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids
biosynthesis. A modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty
acyl-ACPs to the corresponding FFAs, which were then converted to SCAs by the
sequential reactions of E. coli fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Clostridium
acetobutylicum fatty acyl-CoA reductase and Arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde
decarbonylase. The final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of SCAs 
consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane
(64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane
(8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. Furthermore,
this platform strain could produce short-chain FFAs using a fadD-deleted strain, 
and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 wax ester 
synthase (atfA) and the E. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhE(mut)).

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that have an
essential role in human physiology, yet the molecular processes through which
they bind to their endogenous agonists and activate effector proteins remain
poorly understood. So far, it has not been possible to capture an active-state
GPCR bound to its native neurotransmitter. Crystal structures of agonist-bound
GPCRs have relied on the use of either exceptionally high-affinity agonists or
receptor stabilization by mutagenesis. Many natural agonists such as adrenaline, 
which activates the β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR), bind with relatively low affinity,
and they are often chemically unstable. Using directed evolution, we engineered a
high-affinity camelid antibody fragment that stabilizes the active state of the
β2AR, and used this to obtain crystal structures of the activated receptor bound 
to multiple ligands. Here we present structures of the active-state human β2AR
bound to three chemically distinct agonists: the ultrahigh-affinity agonist
BI167107, the high-affinity catecholamine agonist hydroxybenzyl isoproterenol,
and the low-affinity endogenous agonist adrenaline. The crystal structures reveal
a highly conserved overall ligand recognition and activation mode despite diverse
ligand chemical structures and affinities that range from 100 nM to ∼80 pM.
Overall, the adrenaline-bound receptor structure is similar to the others, but it
has substantial rearrangements in extracellular loop three and the extracellular 
tip of transmembrane helix 6. These structures also reveal a water-mediated
hydrogen bond between two conserved tyrosines, which appears to stabilize the
active state of the β2AR and related GPCRs.

Animal cells harbour multiple innate effector mechanisms that inhibit virus
replication. For the pathogenic retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1), these include widely expressed restriction factors, such as APOBEC3
proteins, TRIM5-α, BST2 (refs 4, 5) and SAMHD1 (refs 6, 7), as well as additional
factors that are stimulated by type 1 interferon (IFN). Here we use both ectopic 
expression and gene-silencing experiments to define the human dynamin-like,
IFN-induced myxovirus resistance 2 (MX2, also known as MXB) protein as a potent
inhibitor of HIV-1 infection and as a key effector of IFN-α-mediated resistance
to HIV-1 infection. MX2 suppresses infection by all HIV-1 strains tested, has
equivalent or reduced effects on divergent simian immunodeficiency viruses, and
does not inhibit other retroviruses such as murine leukaemia virus. The Capsid
region of the viral Gag protein dictates susceptibility to MX2, and the block to 
infection occurs at a late post-entry step, with both the nuclear accumulation
and chromosomal integration of nascent viral complementary DNA suppressed.
Finally, human MX1 (also known as MXA), a closely related protein that has long
been recognized as a broadly acting inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses, including
the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus, does not affect HIV-1, whereas MX2 is
ineffective against influenza virus. MX2 is therefore a cell-autonomous,
anti-HIV-1 resistance factor whose purposeful mobilization may represent a new
therapeutic approach for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.

The maize Gα gene COMPACT PLANT2 functions in CLAVATA signalling to control shoot
meristem size.

Bommert P(1), Je BI, Goldshmidt A, Jackson D.

Author information: 
(1)Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, USA.

Shoot growth depends on meristems, pools of stem cells that are maintained by a
negative feedback loop between the CLAVATA pathway and the WUSCHEL homeobox gene.
CLAVATA signalling involves a secreted peptide, CLAVATA3 (CLV3), and its
perception by cell surface leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors, including the
CLV1 receptor kinase and a LRR receptor-like protein, CLV2 (ref. 4). However, the
signalling mechanisms downstream of these receptors are poorly understood,
especially for LRR receptor-like proteins, which lack a signalling domain. Here
we show that maize COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2) encodes the predicted α-subunit (Gα) of a
heterotrimeric GTP binding protein. Maize ct2 phenotypes resemble Arabidopsis
thaliana clavata mutants, and genetic, biochemical and functional assays indicate
that CT2/Gα transmits a stem-cell-restrictive signal from a CLAVATA LRR receptor,
suggesting a new function for Gα signalling in plants. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding
proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that are commonly activated
by ligand binding to an associated seven-pass transmembrane (7TM)
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Recent studies have questioned the idea that
plant heterotrimeric G proteins interact with canonical GPCRs, and our findings
suggest that single pass transmembrane receptors act as GPCRs in plants,
challenging the dogma that GPCRs are exclusively 7TM proteins.

Preservation of neural tissue in early Cambrian arthropods has recently been
demonstrated, to a degree that segmental structures of the head can be associated
with individual brain neuromeres. This association provides novel data for
addressing long-standing controversies about the segmental identities of
specialized head appendages in fossil taxa. Here we document neuroanatomy in the 
head and trunk of a 'great appendage' arthropod, Alalcomenaeus sp., from the
Chengjiang biota, southwest China, providing the most complete neuroanatomical
profile known from a Cambrian animal. Micro-computed tomography reveals a
configuration of one optic neuropil separate from a protocerebrum contiguous with
four head ganglia, succeeded by eight contiguous ganglia in an eleven-segment
trunk. Arrangements of optic neuropils, the brain and ganglia correspond most
closely to the nervous system of Chelicerata of all extant arthropods, supporting
the assignment of 'great appendage' arthropods to the chelicerate total group.
The position of the deutocerebral neuromere aligns with the insertion of the
great appendage, indicating its deutocerebral innervation and corroborating a
homology between the 'great appendage' and chelicera indicated by morphological
similarities. Alalcomenaeus and Fuxianhuia protensa demonstrate that the two main
configurations of the brain observed in modern arthropods, those of Chelicerata
and Mandibulata, respectively, had evolved by the early Cambrian.

Advances in optical spectroscopy and microscopy have had a profound impact
throughout the physical, chemical and biological sciences. One example is
coherent Raman spectroscopy, a versatile technique interrogating vibrational
transitions in molecules. It offers high spatial resolution and three-dimensional
sectioning capabilities that make it a label-free tool for the non-destructive
and chemically selective probing of complex systems. Indeed, single-colour Raman 
bands have been imaged in biological tissue at video rates by using
ultra-short-pulse lasers. However, identifying multiple, and possibly unknown,
molecules requires broad spectral bandwidth and high resolution. Moderate
spectral spans combined with high-speed acquisition are now within reach using
multichannel detection or frequency-swept laser beams. Laser frequency combs are 
finding increasing use for broadband molecular linear absorption spectroscopy.
Here we show, by exploring their potential for nonlinear spectroscopy, that they 
can be harnessed for coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy and spectro-imaging.
The method uses two combs and can simultaneously measure, on the microsecond
timescale, all spectral elements over a wide bandwidth and with high resolution
on a single photodetector. Although the overall measurement time in our
proof-of-principle experiments is limited by the waiting times between successive
spectral acquisitions, this limitation can be overcome with further system
development. We therefore expect that our approach of using laser frequency combs
will not only enable new applications for nonlinear microscopy but also benefit
other nonlinear spectroscopic techniques.

Deterministic entanglement of superconducting qubits by parity measurement and
feedback.

The stochastic evolution of quantum systems during measurement is arguably the
most enigmatic feature of quantum mechanics. Measuring a quantum system typically
steers it towards a classical state, destroying the coherence of an initial
quantum superposition and the entanglement with other quantum systems.
Remarkably, the measurement of a shared property between non-interacting quantum 
systems can generate entanglement, starting from an uncorrelated state. Of
special interest in quantum computing is the parity measurement, which projects
the state of multiple qubits (quantum bits) to a state with an even or odd number
of excited qubits. A parity meter must discern the two qubit-excitation parities 
with high fidelity while preserving coherence between same-parity states. Despite
numerous proposals for atomic, semiconducting and superconducting qubits,
realizing a parity meter that creates entanglement for both even and odd
measurement results has remained an outstanding challenge. Here we perform a
time-resolved, continuous parity measurement of two superconducting qubits using 
the cavity in a three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture
and phase-sensitive parametric amplification. Using postselection, we produce
entanglement by parity measurement reaching 88 per cent fidelity to the closest
Bell state. Incorporating the parity meter in a feedback-control loop, we
transform the entanglement generation from probabilistic to fully deterministic, 
achieving 66 per cent fidelity to a target Bell state on demand. These
realizations of a parity meter and a feedback-enabled deterministic measurement
protocol provide key ingredients for active quantum error correction in the solid
state.

Super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10(44) ergs per second at their 
peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of
0.1-4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability' supernovae.
Such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times that of the Sun that
now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-130 solar masses. In these stars, the photons 
that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs,
causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of
(56)Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to (56)Fe via (56)Co, powering bright
light curves. Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from
metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at
redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity
one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability
supernova. Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous
supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are
incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and
spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call the nature of that event into
question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining
super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by radioactivity. Modelling our 
observations with 10-16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates
the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby
pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than
6 × 10(-6) times that of the core-collapse rate.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis
methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present
data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions
from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. 
We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts
across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin,
environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated
data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for
example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase,
Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle
control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing,
metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of
mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most
tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required 
during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional
factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often
mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies
genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations
with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders
during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for
developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment.

Olivine crystals align during diffusion creep of Earth's upper mantle.

The crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine produced during
dislocation creep is considered to be the primary cause of elastic anisotropy in 
Earth's upper mantle and is often used to determine the direction of mantle flow.
A fundamental question remains, however, as to whether the alignment of olivine
crystals is uniquely produced by dislocation creep. Here we report the
development of CPO in iron-free olivine (that is, forsterite) during diffusion
creep; the intensity and pattern of CPO depend on temperature and the presence of
melt, which control the appearance of crystallographic planes on grain
boundaries. Grain boundary sliding on these crystallography-controlled boundaries
accommodated by diffusion contributes to grain rotation, resulting in a CPO. We
show that strong radial anisotropy is anticipated at temperatures corresponding
to depths where melting initiates to depths where strongly anisotropic and low
seismic velocities are detected. Conversely, weak anisotropy is anticipated at
temperatures corresponding to depths where almost isotropic mantle is found. We
propose diffusion creep to be the primary means of mantle flow.

The US National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with scientists
representing multiple areas of expertise relevant to 'omics'-based test
development, has developed a checklist of criteria that can be used to determine 
the readiness of omics-based tests for guiding patient care in clinical trials.
The checklist criteria cover issues relating to specimens, assays, mathematical
modelling, clinical trial design, and ethical, legal and regulatory aspects.
Funding bodies and journals are encouraged to consider the checklist, which they 
may find useful for assessing study quality and evidence strength. The checklist 
will be used to evaluate proposals for NCI-sponsored clinical trials in which
omics tests will be used to guide therapy.

Progressive phases of multiple sclerosis are associated with inhibited
differentiation of the progenitor cell population that generates the mature
oligodendrocytes required for remyelination and disease remission. To identify
selective inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed an
image-based screen for myelin basic protein (MBP) expression using primary rat
optic-nerve-derived progenitor cells. Here we show that among the most effective 
compounds identifed was benztropine, which significantly decreases clinical
severity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when administered alone or in combination 
with approved immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis. Evidence from 
a cuprizone-induced model of demyelination, in vitro and in vivo T-cell assays
and EAE adoptive transfer experiments indicated that the observed efficacy of
this drug results directly from an enhancement of remyelination rather than
immune suppression. Pharmacological studies indicate that benztropine functions
by a mechanism that involves direct antagonism of M1 and/or M3 muscarinic
receptors. These studies should facilitate the development of effective new
therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that complement established
immunosuppressive approaches.

Nucleation of aerosol particles from trace atmospheric vapours is thought to
provide up to half of global cloud condensation nuclei. Aerosols can cause a net 
cooling of climate by scattering sunlight and by leading to smaller but more
numerous cloud droplets, which makes clouds brighter and extends their lifetimes.
Atmospheric aerosols derived from human activities are thought to have
compensated for a large fraction of the warming caused by greenhouse gases.
However, despite its importance for climate, atmospheric nucleation is poorly
understood. Recently, it has been shown that sulphuric acid and ammonia cannot
explain particle formation rates observed in the lower atmosphere. It is thought 
that amines may enhance nucleation, but until now there has been no direct
evidence for amine ternary nucleation under atmospheric conditions. Here we use
the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets) chamber at CERN and find that
dimethylamine above three parts per trillion by volume can enhance particle
formation rates more than 1,000-fold compared with ammonia, sufficient to account
for the particle formation rates observed in the atmosphere. Molecular analysis
of the clusters reveals that the faster nucleation is explained by a
base-stabilization mechanism involving acid-amine pairs, which strongly decrease 
evaporation. The ion-induced contribution is generally small, reflecting the high
stability of sulphuric acid-dimethylamine clusters and indicating that galactic
cosmic rays exert only a small influence on their formation, except at low
overall formation rates. Our experimental measurements are well reproduced by a
dynamical model based on quantum chemical calculations of binding energies of
molecular clusters, without any fitted parameters. These results show that, in
regions of the atmosphere near amine sources, both amines and sulphur dioxide
should be considered when assessing the impact of anthropogenic activities on
particle formation.

system.

Animals display a repertoire of different social behaviours. Appropriate
behavioural responses depend on sensory input received during social
interactions. In mice, social behaviour is driven by pheromones, chemical signals
that encode information related to age, sex and physiological state. However,
although mice show different social behaviours towards adults, juveniles and
neonates, sensory cues that enable specific recognition of juvenile mice are
unknown. Here we describe a juvenile pheromone produced by young mice before
puberty, termed exocrine-gland secreting peptide 22 (ESP22). ESP22 is secreted
from the lacrimal gland and released into tears of 2- to 3-week-old mice. Upon
detection, ESP22 activates high-affinity sensory neurons in the vomeronasal
organ, and downstream limbic neurons in the medial amygdala. Recombinant ESP22,
painted on mice, exerts a powerful inhibitory effect on adult male mating
behaviour, which is abolished in knockout mice lacking TRPC2, a key signalling
component of the vomeronasal organ. Furthermore, knockout of TRPC2 or loss of
ESP22 production results in increased sexual behaviour of adult males towards
juveniles, and sexual responses towards ESP22-deficient juveniles are suppressed 
by ESP22 painting. Thus, we describe a pheromone of sexually immature mice that
controls an innate social behaviour, a response pathway through the accessory
olfactory system and a new role for vomeronasal organ signalling in inhibiting
sexual behaviour towards young. These findings provide a molecular framework for 
understanding how a sensory system can regulate behaviour.

Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme with
important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation
can be pathological. CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly
induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene
transcription. Here, in human, rat and mouse, we identify a novel mechanism
linking CaMKII and hyperglycaemic signalling in diabetes mellitus, which is a key
risk factor for heart and neurodegenerative diseases. Acute hyperglycaemia causes
covalent modification of CaMKII by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc).
O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII at Ser 279 activates CaMKII autonomously,
creating molecular memory even after Ca(2+) concentration declines.
O-GlcNAc-modified CaMKII is increased in the heart and brain of diabetic humans
and rats. In cardiomyocytes, increased glucose concentration significantly
enhances CaMKII-dependent activation of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)
release events that can contribute to cardiac mechanical dysfunction and
arrhythmias. These effects were prevented by pharmacological inhibition of
O-GlcNAc signalling or genetic ablation of CaMKIIδ. In intact perfused hearts,
arrhythmias were aggravated by increased glucose concentration through O-GlcNAc- 
and CaMKII-dependent pathways. In diabetic animals, acute blockade of O-GlcNAc
inhibited arrhythmogenesis. Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII is a novel
signalling event in pathways that may contribute critically to cardiac and
neuronal pathophysiology in diabetes and other diseases.

Nucleic-acid-binding proteins are generally viewed as either specific or
nonspecific, depending on characteristics of their binding sites in DNA or RNA.
Most studies have focused on specific proteins, which identify cognate sites by
binding with highest affinities to regions with defined signatures in sequence,
structure or both. Proteins that bind to sites devoid of defined sequence or
structure signatures are considered nonspecific. Substrate binding by these
proteins is poorly understood, and it is not known to what extent seemingly
nonspecific proteins discriminate between different binding sites, aside from
those sequestered by nucleic acid structures. Here we systematically examine
substrate binding by the apparently nonspecific RNA-binding protein C5, and find 
clear discrimination between different binding site variants. C5 is the protein
subunit of the transfer RNA processing ribonucleoprotein enzyme RNase P from
Escherichia coli. The protein binds 5' leaders of precursor tRNAs at a site
without sequence or structure signatures. We measure functional binding of C5 to 
all possible sequence variants in its substrate binding site, using a
high-throughput sequencing kinetics approach (HITS-KIN) that simultaneously
follows processing of thousands of RNA species. C5 binds different substrate
variants with affinities varying by orders of magnitude. The distribution of
functional affinities of C5 for all substrate variants resembles affinity
distributions of highly specific nucleic acid binding proteins. Unlike these
specific proteins, C5 does not bind its physiological RNA targets with the
highest affinity, but with affinities near the median of the distribution, a
region that is not associated with a sequence signature. We delineate defined
rules governing substrate recognition by C5, which reveal specificity that is
hidden in cellular substrates for RNase P. Our findings suggest that apparently
nonspecific and specific RNA-binding modes may not differ fundamentally, but
represent distinct parts of common affinity distributions.

Reprogramming of adult cells to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS
cells) has opened new therapeutic opportunities; however, little is known about
the possibility of in vivo reprogramming within tissues. Here we show that
transitory induction of the four factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc in mice
results in teratomas emerging from multiple organs, implying that full
reprogramming can occur in vivo. Analyses of the stomach, intestine, pancreas and
kidney reveal groups of dedifferentiated cells that express the pluripotency
marker NANOG, indicative of in situ reprogramming. By bone marrow
transplantation, we demonstrate that haematopoietic cells can also be
reprogrammed in vivo. Notably, reprogrammable mice present circulating iPS cells 
in the blood and, at the transcriptome level, these in vivo generated iPS cells
are closer to embryonic stem cells (ES cells) than standard in vitro generated
iPS cells. Moreover, in vivo iPS cells efficiently contribute to the
trophectoderm lineage, suggesting that they achieve a more plastic or primitive
state than ES cells. Finally, intraperitoneal injection of in vivo iPS cells
generates embryo-like structures that express embryonic and extraembryonic
markers. We conclude that reprogramming in vivo is feasible and confers
totipotency features absent in standard iPS or ES cells. These discoveries could 
be relevant for future applications of reprogramming in regenerative medicine.

The repair of chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the
maintenance of genomic integrity. However, the repair of DSBs can also
destabilize the genome by causing mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, the
driving forces for carcinogenesis and hereditary diseases. Break-induced
replication (BIR) is one of the DSB repair pathways that is highly prone to
genetic instability. BIR proceeds by invasion of one broken end into a homologous
DNA sequence followed by replication that can copy hundreds of kilobases of DNA
from a donor molecule all the way through its telomere. The resulting repaired
chromosome comes at a great cost to the cell, as BIR promotes mutagenesis, loss
of heterozygosity, translocations, and copy number variations, all hallmarks of
carcinogenesis. BIR uses most known replication proteins to copy large portions
of DNA, similar to S-phase replication. It has therefore been suggested that BIR 
proceeds by semiconservative replication; however, the model of a bona fide,
stable replication fork contradicts the known instabilities associated with BIR
such as a 1,000-fold increase in mutation rate compared to normal replication.
Here we demonstrate that in budding yeast the mechanism of replication during BIR
is significantly different from S-phase replication, as it proceeds via an
unusual bubble-like replication fork that results in conservative inheritance of 
the new genetic material. We provide evidence that this atypical mode of DNA
replication, dependent on Pif1 helicase, is responsible for the marked increase
in BIR-associated mutations. We propose that the BIR mode of synthesis presents a
powerful mechanism that can initiate bursts of genetic instability in eukaryotes,
including humans.

During DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR), DNA synthesis copies
information from a template DNA molecule. Multiple DNA polymerases have been
implicated in repair-specific DNA synthesis, but it has remained unclear whether 
a DNA helicase is involved in this reaction. A good candidate DNA helicase is
Pif1, an evolutionarily conserved helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae important 
for break-induced replication (BIR) as well as HR-dependent telomere maintenance 
in the absence of telomerase found in 10-15% of all cancers. Pif1 has a role in
DNA synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites and in lagging-strand synthesis with
polymerase δ (Polδ). Here we provide evidence that Pif1 stimulates DNA synthesis 
during BIR and crossover recombination. The initial steps of BIR occur normally
in Pif1-deficient cells, but Polδ recruitment and DNA synthesis are decreased,
resulting in premature resolution of DNA intermediates into half-crossovers.
Purified Pif1 protein strongly stimulates Polδ-mediated DNA synthesis from a
D-loop made by the Rad51 recombinase. Notably, Pif1 liberates the newly
synthesized strand to prevent the accumulation of topological constraint and to
facilitate extensive DNA synthesis via the establishment of a migrating D-loop
structure. Our results uncover a novel function of Pif1 and provide insights into
the mechanism of HR.

Repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) requires the coordinated action of the
intra-S-phase checkpoint and the Fanconi anaemia pathway, which promote ICL
incision, translesion synthesis and homologous recombination (reviewed in refs 1,
2). Previous studies have implicated the 3'-5' superfamily 2 helicase HELQ in ICL
repair in Drosophila melanogaster (MUS301 (ref. 3)) and Caenorhabditis elegans
(HELQ-1 (ref. 4)). Although in vitro analysis suggests that HELQ preferentially
unwinds synthetic replication fork substrates with 3' single-stranded DNA
overhangs and also disrupts protein-DNA interactions while translocating along
DNA, little is known regarding its functions in mammalian organisms. Here we
report that HELQ helicase-deficient mice exhibit subfertility, germ cell
attrition, ICL sensitivity and tumour predisposition, with Helq heterozygous mice
exhibiting a similar, albeit less severe, phenotype than the null, indicative of 
haploinsufficiency. We establish that HELQ interacts directly with the RAD51
paralogue complex BCDX2 and functions in parallel to the Fanconi anaemia pathway 
to promote efficient homologous recombination at damaged replication forks. Thus,
our results reveal a critical role for HELQ in replication-coupled DNA repair,
germ cell maintenance and tumour suppression in mammals.

Statins are prescribed widely to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk and have been shown to have
beneficial effects in a broad range of patients. However, statins are associated 
with an increased risk, albeit small, of clinical myopathy and type 2 diabetes.
Despite evidence for substantial genetic influence on LDL concentrations,
pharmacogenomic trials have failed to identify genetic variations with large
effects on either statin efficacy or toxicity, and have produced little
information regarding mechanisms that modulate statin response. Here we identify 
a downstream target of statin treatment by screening for the effects of in vitro 
statin exposure on genetic associations with gene expression levels in
lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 480 participants of a clinical trial of
simvastatin treatment. This analysis identified six expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTLs) that interacted with simvastatin exposure, including rs9806699, a
cis-eQTL for the gene glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) that encodes the
rate-limiting enzyme in creatine synthesis. We found this locus to be associated 
with incidence of statin-induced myotoxicity in two separate populations
(meta-analysis odds ratio = 0.60). Furthermore, we found that GATM knockdown in
hepatocyte-derived cell lines attenuated transcriptional response to sterol
depletion, demonstrating that GATM may act as a functional link between
statin-mediated lowering of cholesterol and susceptibility to statin-induced
myopathy.

Bottom-up control of geomagnetic secular variation by the Earth's inner core.

Temporal changes in the Earth's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic secular
variation, occur most prominently at low latitudes in the Atlantic hemisphere
(that is, from -90 degrees east to 90 degrees east), whereas in the Pacific
hemisphere there is comparatively little activity. This is a consequence of the
geographical localization of intense, westward drifting, equatorial magnetic flux
patches at the core surface. Despite successes in explaining the morphology of
the geomagnetic field, numerical models of the geodynamo have so far failed to
account systematically for this striking pattern of geomagnetic secular
variation. Here we show that it can be reproduced provided that two mechanisms
relying on the inner core are jointly considered. First, gravitational coupling
aligns the inner core with the mantle, forcing the flow of liquid metal in the
outer core into a giant, westward drifting, sheet-like gyre. The resulting shear 
concentrates azimuthal magnetic flux at low latitudes close to the core-mantle
boundary, where it is expelled by core convection and subsequently transported
westward. Second, differential inner-core growth, fastest below Indonesia, causes
an asymmetric buoyancy release in the outer core which in turn distorts the gyre,
forcing it to become eccentric, in agreement with recent core flow inversions.
This bottom-up heterogeneous driving of core convection dominates top-down
driving from mantle thermal heterogeneities, and localizes magnetic variations in
a longitudinal sector centred beneath the Atlantic, where the eccentric gyre
reaches the core surface. To match the observed pattern of geomagnetic secular
variation, the solid material forming the inner core must now be in a state of
differential growth rather than one of growth and melting induced by convective
translation.

The discovery of quasicrystals--crystalline structures that show order while
lacking periodicity--forced a paradigm shift in crystallography. Initially
limited to intermetallic systems, the observation of quasicrystalline structures 
has recently expanded to include 'soft' quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal 
and supermolecular chemistry. Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a
two-dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111)
substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a
high-temperature interface-driven structure with 12-fold symmetry. The building
blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted
Stampfli-Gähler tiling having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example
of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic 
perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range 
of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface
between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic
quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously. Such structures might also find
use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches 
in conventional epitaxy.

The length of time that a quantum system can exist in a superposition state is
determined by how strongly it interacts with its environment. This interaction
entangles the quantum state with the inherent fluctuations of the environment. If
these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be viewed as a source of
noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system from an initially pure
state into a statistical mixture--a process known as decoherence. However, by
accurately measuring the environment in real time, the quantum system can be
maintained in a pure state and its time evolution described by a 'quantum
trajectory' determined by the measurement outcome. Here we use weak measurements 
to monitor a microwave cavity containing a superconducting quantum bit (qubit),
and track the individual quantum trajectories of the system. In this set-up, the 
environment is dominated by the fluctuations of a single electromagnetic mode of 
the cavity. Using a near-quantum-limited parametric amplifier, we selectively
measure either the phase or the amplitude of the cavity field, and thereby
confine trajectories to either the equator or a meridian of the Bloch sphere. We 
perform quantum state tomography at discrete times along the trajectory to verify
that we have faithfully tracked the state of the quantum system as it diffuses on
the surface of the Bloch sphere. Our results demonstrate that decoherence can be 
mitigated by environmental monitoring, and validate the foundation of quantum
feedback approaches based on Bayesian statistics. Moreover, our experiments
suggest a new means of implementing 'quantum steering'--the harnessing of action 
at a distance to manipulate quantum states through measurement.

Atomic nuclei are finite quantum systems composed of two distinct types of
fermion--protons and neutrons. In a manner similar to that of electrons orbiting 
in an atom, protons and neutrons in a nucleus form shell structures. In the case 
of stable, naturally occurring nuclei, large energy gaps exist between shells
that fill completely when the proton or neutron number is equal to 2, 8, 20, 28, 
50, 82 or 126 (ref. 1). Away from stability, however, these so-called 'magic
numbers' are known to evolve in systems with a large imbalance of protons and
neutrons. Although some of the standard shell closures can disappear, new ones
are known to appear. Studies aiming to identify and understand such behaviour are
of major importance in the field of experimental and theoretical nuclear physics.
Here we report a spectroscopic study of the neutron-rich nucleus (54)Ca (a bound 
system composed of 20 protons and 34 neutrons) using proton knockout reactions
involving fast radioactive projectiles. The results highlight the doubly magic
nature of (54)Ca and provide direct experimental evidence for the onset of a
sizable subshell closure at neutron number 34 in isotopes far from stability.

Ecological and societal disruptions by modern climate change are critically
determined by the time frame over which climates shift beyond historical
analogues. Here we present a new index of the year when the projected mean
climate of a given location moves to a state continuously outside the bounds of
historical variability under alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.
Using 1860 to 2005 as the historical period, this index has a global mean of 2069
(±18 years s.d.) for near-surface air temperature under an emissions
stabilization scenario and 2047 (±14 years s.d.) under a 'business-as-usual'
scenario. Unprecedented climates will occur earliest in the tropics and among
low-income countries, highlighting the vulnerability of global biodiversity and
the limited governmental capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change.
Our findings shed light on the urgency of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions if 
climates potentially harmful to biodiversity and society are to be prevented.

Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pumps three Na(+) ions out of cells in exchange for two K(+)
taken up from the extracellular medium per ATP molecule hydrolysed, thereby
establishing Na(+) and K(+) gradients across the membrane in all animal cells.
These ion gradients are used in many fundamental processes, notably excitation of
nerve cells. Here we describe 2.8 Å-resolution crystal structures of this ATPase 
from pig kidney with bound Na(+), ADP and aluminium fluoride, a stable phosphate 
analogue, with and without oligomycin that promotes Na(+) occlusion. These
crystal structures represent a transition state preceding the phosphorylated
intermediate (E1P) in which three Na(+) ions are occluded. Details of the
Na(+)-binding sites show how this ATPase functions as a Na(+)-specific pump,
rejecting K(+) and Ca(2+), even though its affinity for Na(+) is low (millimolar 
dissociation constant). A mechanism for sequential, cooperative Na(+) binding can
now be formulated in atomic detail.

Nutrient deprivation is a stimulus shared by both autophagy and the formation of 
primary cilia. The recently discovered role of primary cilia in nutrient sensing 
and signalling motivated us to explore the possible functional interactions
between this signalling hub and autophagy. Here we show that part of the
molecular machinery involved in ciliogenesis also participates in the early steps
of the autophagic process. Signalling from the cilia, such as that from the
Hedgehog pathway, induces autophagy by acting directly on essential
autophagy-related proteins strategically located in the base of the cilium by
ciliary trafficking proteins. Whereas abrogation of ciliogenesis partially
inhibits autophagy, blockage of autophagy enhances primary cilia growth and
cilia-associated signalling during normal nutritional conditions. We propose that
basal autophagy regulates ciliary growth through the degradation of proteins
required for intraflagellar transport. Compromised ability to activate the
autophagic response may underlie some common ciliopathies.

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that functions in sensory and
signalling pathways. Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic
syndromes known as ciliopathies. However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary
ciliogenesis in normal and cancer cells are incompletely understood. Here we
demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a ciliopathy protein, OFD1
(oral-facial-digital syndrome 1), at centriolar satellites promotes primary
cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged
organelles and protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to
lysosomes for destruction. We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar 
satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy upon serum starvation. In
autophagy-deficient Atg5 or Atg3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, OFD1
accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia 
and a defective recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These
defects are fully rescued by OFD1 partial knockdown that reduces the population
of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. More strikingly, OFD1 depletion at centriolar
satellites promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and transformed breast 
cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that removal
of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to
promote ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized
role of autophagy in organelle biogenesis.

Neisseria meningitidis has several strategies to evade complement-mediated
killing, and these contribute to its ability to cause septicaemic disease and
meningitis. However, the meningococcus is primarily an obligate commensal of the 
human nasopharynx, and it is unclear why the bacterium has evolved exquisite
mechanisms to avoid host immunity. Here we demonstrate that mechanisms of
meningococcal immune evasion and resistance against complement increase in
response to an increase in ambient temperature. We have identified three
independent RNA thermosensors located in the 5' untranslated regions of genes
necessary for capsule biosynthesis, the expression of factor H binding protein,
and sialylation of lipopolysaccharide, which are essential for meningococcal
resistance against immune killing. Therefore increased temperature (which occurs 
during inflammation) acts as a 'danger signal' for the meningococcus, enhancing
its defence against human immune killing. Infection with viral pathogens, such as
influenza, leads to inflammation in the nasopharynx with an increased temperature
and recruitment of immune effectors. Thermoregulation of immune defence could
offer an adaptive advantage to the meningococcus during co-infection with other
pathogens, and promote the emergence of virulence in an otherwise commensal
bacterium.

The gnathostome (jawed vertebrate) crown group comprises two extant clades with
contrasting character complements. Notably, Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish)
lack the large dermal bones that characterize Osteichthyes (bony fish and
tetrapods). The polarities of these differences, and the morphology of the last
common ancestor of crown gnathostomes, are the subject of continuing debate. Here
we describe a three-dimensionally preserved 419-million-year-old placoderm fish
from the Silurian of China that represents the first stem gnathostome with dermal
marginal jaw bones (premaxilla, maxilla and dentary), features previously
restricted to Osteichthyes. A phylogenetic analysis places the new form near the 
top of the gnathostome stem group but does not fully resolve its relationships to
other placoderms. The analysis also assigns all acanthodians to the
chondrichthyan stem group. These results suggest that the last common ancestor of
Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes had a macromeric dermal skeleton, and provide a
new framework for studying crown gnathostome divergence.

Eosinophils are specialized myeloid cells associated with allergy and helminth
infections. Blood eosinophils demonstrate circadian cycling, as described over
80 years ago, and are abundant in the healthy gastrointestinal tract. Although a 
cytokine, interleukin (IL)-5, and chemokines such as eotaxins mediate eosinophil 
development and survival, and tissue recruitment, respectively, the processes
underlying the basal regulation of these signals remain unknown. Here we show
that serum IL-5 levels are maintained by long-lived type 2 innate lymphoid cells 
(ILC2) resident in peripheral tissues. ILC2 cells secrete IL-5 constitutively and
are induced to co-express IL-13 during type 2 inflammation, resulting in
localized eotaxin production and eosinophil accumulation. In the small intestine 
where eosinophils and eotaxin are constitutive, ILC2 cells co-express IL-5 and
IL-13; this co-expression is enhanced after caloric intake. The circadian
synchronizer vasoactive intestinal peptide also stimulates ILC2 cells through the
VPAC2 receptor to release IL-5, linking eosinophil levels with metabolic cycling.
Tissue ILC2 cells regulate basal eosinophilopoiesis and tissue eosinophil
accumulation through constitutive and stimulated cytokine expression, and this
dissociated regulation can be tuned by nutrient intake and central circadian
rhythms.

Forests contribute a significant portion of the land carbon sink, but their
ability to sequester CO2 may be constrained by nitrogen, a major plant-limiting
nutrient. Many tropical forests possess tree species capable of fixing
atmospheric dinitrogen (N2), but it is unclear whether this functional group can 
supply the nitrogen needed as forests recover from disturbance or previous land
use, or expand in response to rising CO2 (refs 6, 8). Here we identify a powerful
feedback mechanism in which N2 fixation can overcome ecosystem-scale deficiencies
in nitrogen that emerge during periods of rapid biomass accumulation in tropical 
forests. Over a 300-year chronosequence in Panama, N2-fixing tree species
accumulated carbon up to nine times faster per individual than their non-fixing
neighbours (greatest difference in youngest forests), and showed species-specific
differences in the amount and timing of fixation. As a result of fast growth and 
high fixation, fixers provided a large fraction of the nitrogen needed to support
net forest growth (50,000 kg carbon per hectare) in the first 12 years. A key
element of ecosystem functional diversity was ensured by the presence of
different N2-fixing tree species across the entire forest age sequence. These
findings show that symbiotic N2 fixation can have a central role in nitrogen
cycling during tropical forest stand development, with potentially important
implications for the ability of tropical forests to sequester CO2.

Faithful propagation of DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication is
critical for maintaining cellular phenotypes of individual differentiated cells. 
Although it is well established that Uhrf1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring
finger domains 1; also known as Np95 and ICBP90) specifically binds to
hemi-methylated DNA through its SRA (SET and RING finger associated) domain and
has an essential role in maintenance of DNA methylation by recruiting Dnmt1 to
hemi-methylated DNA sites, the mechanism by which Uhrf1 coordinates the
maintenance of DNA methylation and DNA replication is largely unknown. Here we
show that Uhrf1-dependent histone H3 ubiquitylation has a prerequisite role in
the maintenance DNA methylation. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we successfully
reproduce maintenance DNA methylation in vitro. Dnmt1 depletion results in a
marked accumulation of Uhrf1-dependent ubiquitylation of histone H3 at lysine 23.
Dnmt1 preferentially associates with ubiquitylated H3 in vitro though a region
previously identified as a replication foci targeting sequence. The RING finger
mutant of Uhrf1 fails to recruit Dnmt1 to DNA replication sites and maintain DNA 
methylation in mammalian cultured cells. Our findings represent the first
evidence, to our knowledge, of the mechanistic link between DNA methylation and
DNA replication through histone H3 ubiquitylation.

Genome-wide signatures of convergent evolution in echolocating mammals.

Evolution is typically thought to proceed through divergence of genes, proteins
and ultimately phenotypes. However, similar traits might also evolve convergently
in unrelated taxa owing to similar selection pressures. Adaptive phenotypic
convergence is widespread in nature, and recent results from several genes have
suggested that this phenomenon is powerful enough to also drive recurrent
evolution at the sequence level. Where homoplasious substitutions do occur these 
have long been considered the result of neutral processes. However, recent
studies have demonstrated that adaptive convergent sequence evolution can be
detected in vertebrates using statistical methods that model parallel evolution, 
although the extent to which sequence convergence between genera occurs across
genomes is unknown. Here we analyse genomic sequence data in mammals that have
independently evolved echolocation and show that convergence is not a rare
process restricted to several loci but is instead widespread, continuously
distributed and commonly driven by natural selection acting on a small number of 
sites per locus. Systematic analyses of convergent sequence evolution in 805,053 
amino acids within 2,326 orthologous coding gene sequences compared across 22
mammals (including four newly sequenced bat genomes) revealed signatures
consistent with convergence in nearly 200 loci. Strong and significant support
for convergence among bats and the bottlenose dolphin was seen in numerous genes 
linked to hearing or deafness, consistent with an involvement in echolocation.
Unexpectedly, we also found convergence in many genes linked to vision: the
convergent signal of many sensory genes was robustly correlated with the strength
of natural selection. This first attempt to detect genome-wide convergent
sequence evolution across divergent taxa reveals the phenomenon to be much more
pervasive than previously recognized.

A novel H7N9 influenza A virus first detected in March 2013 has since caused more
than 130 human infections in China, resulting in 40 deaths. Preliminary analyses 
suggest that the virus is a reassortant of H7, N9 and H9N2 avian influenza
viruses, and carries some amino acids associated with mammalian receptor binding,
raising concerns of a new pandemic. However, neither the source populations of
the H7N9 outbreak lineage nor the conditions for its genesis are fully known.
Using a combination of active surveillance, screening of virus archives, and
evolutionary analyses, here we show that H7 viruses probably transferred from
domestic duck to chicken populations in China on at least two independent
occasions. We show that the H7 viruses subsequently reassorted with enzootic H9N2
viruses to generate the H7N9 outbreak lineage, and a related previously
unrecognized H7N7 lineage. The H7N9 outbreak lineage has spread over a large
geographic region and is prevalent in chickens at live poultry markets, which are
thought to be the immediate source of human infections. Whether the H7N9 outbreak
lineage has, or will, become enzootic in China and neighbouring regions requires 
further investigation. The discovery here of a related H7N7 influenza virus in
chickens that has the ability to infect mammals experimentally, suggests that H7 
viruses may pose threats beyond the current outbreak. The continuing prevalence
of H7 viruses in poultry could lead to the generation of highly pathogenic
variants and further sporadic human infections, with a continued risk of the
virus acquiring human-to-human transmissibility.

The blood system is maintained by a small pool of haematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs), which are required and sufficient for replenishing all human blood cell
lineages at millions of cells per second throughout life. Megakaryocytes in the
bone marrow are responsible for the continuous production of platelets in the
blood, crucial for preventing bleeding--a common and life-threatening side effect
of many cancer therapies--and major efforts are focused at identifying the most
suitable cellular and molecular targets to enhance platelet production after bone
marrow transplantation or chemotherapy. Although it has become clear that
distinct HSC subsets exist that are stably biased towards the generation of
lymphoid or myeloid blood cells, we are yet to learn whether other types of
lineage-biased HSC exist or understand their inter-relationships and how
differently lineage-biased HSCs are generated and maintained. The functional
relevance of notable phenotypic and molecular similarities between megakaryocytes
and bone marrow cells with an HSC cell-surface phenotype remains unclear. Here we
identify and prospectively isolate a molecularly and functionally distinct mouse 
HSC subset primed for platelet-specific gene expression, with enhanced propensity
for short- and long-term reconstitution of platelets. Maintenance of
platelet-biased HSCs crucially depends on thrombopoietin, the primary extrinsic
regulator of platelet development. Platelet-primed HSCs also frequently have a
long-term myeloid lineage bias, can self-renew and give rise to lymphoid-biased
HSCs. These findings show that HSC subtypes can be organized into a cellular
hierarchy, with platelet-primed HSCs at the apex. They also demonstrate that
molecular and functional priming for platelet development initiates already in a 
distinct HSC population. The identification of a platelet-primed HSC population
should enable the rational design of therapies enhancing platelet output.

Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are secondary transport proteins that 
mediate the uptake of glutamate and other amino acids. EAATs fulfil an important 
role in neuronal signal transmission by clearing the excitatory neurotransmitters
from the synaptic cleft after depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. An
intensively studied model system for understanding the transport mechanism of
EAATs is the archaeal aspartate transporter GltPh. Each subunit in the
homotrimeric GltPh supports the coupled translocation of one aspartate molecule
and three Na(+) ions as well as an uncoupled flux of Cl(-) ions. Recent crystal
structures of GltPh revealed three possible conformations for the subunits, but
it is unclear whether the motions of individual subunits are coordinated to
support transport. Here, we report the direct observation of conformational
dynamics in individual GltPh trimers embedded in the membrane by applying
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). By analysing the
transporters in a lipid bilayer instead of commonly used detergent micelles, we
achieve conditions that approximate the physiologically relevant ones. From the
kinetics of FRET level transitions we conclude that the three GltPh subunits
undergo conformational changes stochastically and independently of each other.

through the phase transformation many times without degradation of properties
(termed 'reversibility') is critical for these applications. Materials tuned to
satisfy a certain geometric compatibility condition have been shown to exhibit
high reversibility, measured by low hysteresis and small migration of
transformation temperature under cycling. Recently, stronger compatibility
conditions called the 'cofactor conditions' have been proposed theoretically to
achieve even better reversibility. Here we report the enhanced reversibility and 
unusual microstructure of the first martensitic material, Zn45Au30Cu25, that
closely satisfies the cofactor conditions. We observe four striking properties of
this material. (1) Despite a transformation strain of 8%, the transformation
temperature shifts less than 0.5 °C after more than 16,000 thermal cycles. For
comparison, the transformation temperature of the ubiquitous NiTi alloy shifts up
to 20 °C in the first 20 cycles. (2) The hysteresis remains approximately 2 °C
during this cycling. For comparison, the hysteresis of the NiTi alloy is up to
70 °C (refs 9, 12). (3) The alloy exhibits an unusual riverine microstructure of 
martensite not seen in other martensites. (4) Unlike that of typical polycrystal 
martensites, its microstructure changes drastically in consecutive transformation
cycles, whereas macroscopic properties such as transformation temperature and
latent heat are nearly reproducible. These results promise a concrete strategy
for seeking ultra-reliable martensitic materials.

The remarkable optical properties of metal nanoparticles are governed by the
excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). The sensitivity of
each LSPR mode, whose spatial distribution and resonant energy depend on the
nanoparticle structure, composition and environment, has given rise to many
potential photonic, optoelectronic, catalytic, photovoltaic, and gas- and
bio-sensing applications. However, the precise interplay between the
three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticle structure and the LSPRs is not always fully
understood and a spectrally sensitive 3D imaging technique is needed to visualize
the excitation on the nanometre scale. Here we show that 3D images related to
LSPRs of an individual silver nanocube can be reconstructed through the
application of electron energy-loss spectrum imaging, mapping the excitation
across a range of orientations, with a novel combination of non-negative matrix
factorization, compressed sensing and electron tomography. Our results extend the
idea of substrate-mediated hybridization of dipolar and quadrupolar modes
predicted by theory, simulations, and electron and optical spectroscopy, and
provide experimental evidence of higher-energy mode hybridization. This work
represents an advance both in the understanding of the optical response of
noble-metal nanoparticles and in the probing, analysis and visualization of
LSPRs.

Supervolcanoes within an ancient volcanic province in Arabia Terra, Mars.

Michalski JR(1), Bleacher JE.

Author information:

Several irregularly shaped craters located within Arabia Terra, Mars, represent a
new type of highland volcanic construct and together constitute a previously
unrecognized Martian igneous province. Similar to terrestrial supervolcanoes,
these low-relief paterae possess a range of geomorphic features related to
structural collapse, effusive volcanism and explosive eruptions. Extruded lavas
contributed to the formation of enigmatic highland ridged plains in Arabia Terra.
Outgassed sulphur and erupted fine-grained pyroclastics from these calderas
probably fed the formation of altered, layered sedimentary rocks and fretted
terrain found throughout the equatorial region. The discovery of a new type of
volcanic construct in the Arabia volcanic province fundamentally changes the
picture of ancient volcanism and climate evolution on Mars. Other eroded
topographic basins in the ancient Martian highlands that have been dismissed as
degraded impact craters should be reconsidered as possible volcanic constructs
formed in an early phase of widespread, disseminated magmatism on Mars.

The fundamental properties of light derive from its constituent
particles--massless quanta (photons) that do not interact with one another.
However, it has long been known that the realization of coherent interactions
between individual photons, akin to those associated with conventional massive
particles, could enable a wide variety of novel scientific and engineering
applications. Here we demonstrate a quantum nonlinear medium inside which
individual photons travel as massive particles with strong mutual attraction,
such that the propagation of photon pairs is dominated by a two-photon bound
state. We achieve this through dispersive coupling of light to strongly
interacting atoms in highly excited Rydberg states. We measure the dynamical
evolution of the two-photon wavefunction using time-resolved quantum state
tomography, and demonstrate a conditional phase shift exceeding one radian,
resulting in polarization-entangled photon pairs. Particular applications of this
technique include all-optical switching, deterministic photonic quantum logic and
the generation of strongly correlated states of light.

Large-scale chromosome structure and spatial nuclear arrangement have been linked
to control of gene expression and DNA replication and repair. Genomic techniques 
based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) assess contacts for millions of
loci simultaneously, but do so by averaging chromosome conformations from
millions of nuclei. Here we introduce single-cell Hi-C, combined with genome-wide
statistical analysis and structural modelling of single-copy X chromosomes, to
show that individual chromosomes maintain domain organization at the megabase
scale, but show variable cell-to-cell chromosome structures at larger scales.
Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to
boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation.
Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies
of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic
chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with
genome activity patterns.

The existence of bound states of elementary spin waves (magnons) in
one-dimensional quantum magnets was predicted almost 80 years ago. Identifying
signatures of magnon bound states has so far remained the subject of intense
theoretical research, and their detection has proved challenging for experiments.
Ultracold atoms offer an ideal setting in which to find such bound states by
tracking the spin dynamics with single-spin and single-site resolution following 
a local excitation. Here we use in situ correlation measurements to observe
two-magnon bound states directly in a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain
comprising ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We observe the quantum 
dynamics of free and bound magnon states through time-resolved measurements of
two spin impurities. The increased effective mass of the compound magnon state
results in slower spin dynamics as compared to single-magnon excitations. We also
determine the decay time of bound magnons, which is probably limited by
scattering on thermal fluctuations in the system. Our results provide a new way
of studying fundamental properties of quantum magnets and, more generally,
properties of interacting impurities in quantum many-body systems.

Somatic cells can be inefficiently and stochastically reprogrammed into induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by exogenous expression of Oct4 (also called
Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (hereafter referred to as OSKM). The nature of the
predominant rate-limiting barrier(s) preventing the majority of cells to
successfully and synchronously reprogram remains to be defined. Here we show that
depleting Mbd3, a core member of the Mbd3/NuRD (nucleosome remodelling and
deacetylation) repressor complex, together with OSKM transduction and
reprogramming in naive pluripotency promoting conditions, result in deterministic
and synchronized iPS cell reprogramming (near 100% efficiency within seven days
from mouse and human cells). Our findings uncover a dichotomous molecular
function for the reprogramming factors, serving to reactivate endogenous
pluripotency networks while simultaneously directly recruiting the Mbd3/NuRD
repressor complex that potently restrains the reactivation of OSKM downstream
target genes. Subsequently, the latter interactions, which are largely depleted
during early pre-implantation development in vivo, lead to a stochastic and
protracted reprogramming trajectory towards pluripotency in vitro. The
deterministic reprogramming approach devised here offers a novel platform for the
dissection of molecular dynamics leading to establishing pluripotency at
unprecedented flexibility and resolution.

The human genome is pervasively transcribed, yet only a small fraction is coding.
Here we address whether this non-coding transcription arises at promoters, and
detail the interactions of initiation factors TATA box binding protein (TBP),
transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Using ChIP-exo
(chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by
high-throughput sequencing), we identify approximately 160,000 transcription
initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer
genomes. Only about 5% associate with messenger RNA genes. The remainder
associates with non-polyadenylated non-coding transcription. Regardless, Pol II
moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP and TFIIB remain at the
promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core
promoter elements- upstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu), TATA, downstream
TFIIB recognition element (BREd), and initiator element (INR)-in constrained
positions. All but the INR also reside at Pol III promoters, where TBP makes
similar contacts. This comprehensive and high-resolution genome-wide detection of
the initiation machinery produces a consolidated view of transcription initiation
events from yeast to humans at Pol II/III TATA-containing/TATA-less coding and
non-coding genes.

Bacteria use modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) to assemble complex polyketides,
many of which are leads for the development of clinical drugs, in particular
anti-infectives and anti-tumoral agents. Because these multifarious compounds are
notoriously difficult to synthesize, they are usually produced by microbial
fermentation. During the past two decades, an impressive body of knowledge on
modular PKSs has been gathered that not only provides detailed insight into the
biosynthetic pathways but also allows the rational engineering of enzymatic
processing lines to yield structural analogues. Notably, a hallmark of all PKS
modules studied so far is the head-to-tail fusion of acyl and malonyl building
blocks, which leads to linear backbones. Yet, structural diversity is limited by 
this uniform assembly mode. Here we demonstrate a new type of PKS module from the
endofungal bacterium Burkholderia rhizoxinica that catalyses a Michael-type
acetyl addition to generate a branch in the carbon chain. In vitro reconstitution
of the entire PKS module, X-ray structures of a ketosynthase-branching didomain
and mutagenesis experiments revealed a crucial role of the ketosynthase domain in
branching the carbon chain. We present a trapped intermediary state in which acyl
carrier protein and ketosynthase are covalently linked by the branched polyketide
and suggest a new mechanism for chain alkylation, which is functionally distinct 
from terpenoid-like β-branching. For the rice seedling blight toxin rhizoxin, one
of the strongest known anti-mitotic agents, the non-canonical polyketide
modification is indispensable for phytotoxic and anti-tumoral activities. We
propose that the formation of related pharmacophoric groups follows the same
general scheme and infer a unifying vinylogous branching reaction for PKS modules
with a ketosynthase-branching-acyl-carrier-protein architecture. This study
unveils the structure and function of a new PKS module that broadens the
biosynthetic scope of polyketide biosynthesis and sets the stage for rationally
creating structural diversity.

Calving fluxes and basal melt rates of Antarctic ice shelves.

Iceberg calving has been assumed to be the dominant cause of mass loss for the
Antarctic ice sheet, with previous estimates of the calving flux exceeding
2,000 gigatonnes per year. More recently, the importance of melting by the ocean 
has been demonstrated close to the grounding line and near the calving front. So 
far, however, no study has reliably quantified the calving flux and the basal
mass balance (the balance between accretion and ablation at the ice-shelf base)
for the whole of Antarctica. The distribution of fresh water in the Southern
Ocean and its partitioning between the liquid and solid phases is therefore
poorly constrained. Here we estimate the mass balance components for all ice
shelves in Antarctica, using satellite measurements of calving flux and
grounding-line flux, modelled ice-shelf snow accumulation rates and a regional
scaling that accounts for unsurveyed areas. We obtain a total calving flux of
1,321 ± 144 gigatonnes per year and a total basal mass balance of
-1,454 ± 174 gigatonnes per year. This means that about half of the ice-sheet
surface mass gain is lost through oceanic erosion before reaching the ice front, 
and the calving flux is about 34 per cent less than previous estimates derived
from iceberg tracking. In addition, the fraction of mass loss due to basal
processes varies from about 10 to 90 per cent between ice shelves. We find a
significant positive correlation between basal mass loss and surface elevation
change for ice shelves experiencing surface lowering and enhanced discharge. We
suggest that basal mass loss is a valuable metric for predicting future ice-shelf
vulnerability to oceanic forcing.

Established infections with the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV
and SIV, respectively) are thought to be permanent with even the most effective
immune responses and antiretroviral therapies only able to control, but not
clear, these infections. Whether the residual virus that maintains these
infections is vulnerable to clearance is a question of central importance to the 
future management of millions of HIV-infected individuals. We recently reported
that approximately 50% of rhesus macaques (RM; Macaca mulatta) vaccinated with
SIV protein-expressing rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV/SIV) vectors manifest
durable, aviraemic control of infection with the highly pathogenic strain
SIVmac239 (ref. 5). Here we show that regardless of the route of challenge,
RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited immune responses control SIVmac239 after demonstrable
lymphatic and haematogenous viral dissemination, and that replication-competent
SIV persists in several sites for weeks to months. Over time, however, protected 
RM lost signs of SIV infection, showing a consistent lack of measurable plasma-
or tissue-associated virus using ultrasensitive assays, and a loss of T-cell
reactivity to SIV determinants not in the vaccine. Extensive ultrasensitive
quantitative PCR and quantitative PCR with reverse transcription analyses of
tissues from RhCMV/SIV vector-protected RM necropsied 69-172 weeks after
challenge did not detect SIV RNA or DNA sequences above background levels, and
replication-competent SIV was not detected in these RM by extensive co-culture
analysis of tissues or by adoptive transfer of 60 million haematolymphoid cells
to naive RM. These data provide compelling evidence for progressive clearance of 
a pathogenic lentiviral infection, and suggest that some lentiviral reservoirs
may be susceptible to the continuous effector memory T-cell-mediated immune
surveillance elicited and maintained by cytomegalovirus vectors.

Cyclin A regulates kinetochore microtubules to promote faithful chromosome
segregation.

The most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in
metaphase. Chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the
formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules.
Notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-MT) attachment errors are present in
early mitosis (prometaphase), and the persistence of those errors is the leading 
cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that
continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability. 
How robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free
mitosis remains unknown. Here we show that k-MT attachments in prometaphase cells
are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells. The switch to more stable
k-MT attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of
cyclin A in prometaphase. Persistent cyclin A expression prevents k-MT
stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes. By contrast, k-MTs are
prematurely stabilized in cyclin-A-deficient cells. Consequently, cells lacking
cyclin A display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation. Thus, the stability 
of k-MT attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all
chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase. Cyclin A creates a
cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in
prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome
segregation.

The human intestine, colonized by a dense community of resident microbes, is a
frequent target of bacterial pathogens. Undisturbed, this intestinal microbiota
provides protection from bacterial infections. Conversely, disruption of the
microbiota with oral antibiotics often precedes the emergence of several enteric 
pathogens. How pathogens capitalize upon the failure of microbiota-afforded
protection is largely unknown. Here we show that two antibiotic-associated
pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and
Clostridium difficile, use a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated
mucosal carbohydrates during their expansion within the gut. S. typhimurium
accesses fucose and sialic acid within the lumen of the gut in a
microbiota-dependent manner, and genetic ablation of the respective catabolic
pathways reduces its competitiveness in vivo. Similarly, C. difficile expansion
is aided by microbiota-induced elevation of sialic acid levels in vivo.
Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with a sialidase-deficient mutant of Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron, a model gut symbiont, reduces free sialic acid levels resulting
in C. difficile downregulating its sialic acid catabolic pathway and exhibiting
impaired expansion. These effects are reversed by exogenous dietary
administration of free sialic acid. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment of
conventional mice induces a spike in free sialic acid and mutants of both
Salmonella and C. difficile that are unable to catabolize sialic acid exhibit
impaired expansion. These data show that antibiotic-induced disruption of the
resident microbiota and subsequent alteration in mucosal carbohydrate
availability are exploited by these two distantly related enteric pathogens in a 
similar manner. This insight suggests new therapeutic approaches for preventing
diseases caused by antibiotic-associated pathogens.

Circulating lymphocytes continuously enter lymph nodes for immune surveillance
through specialized blood vessels named high endothelial venules, a process that 
increases markedly during immune responses. How high endothelial venules (HEVs)
permit lymphocyte transmigration while maintaining vascular integrity is unknown.
Here we report a role for the transmembrane O-glycoprotein podoplanin (PDPN, also
known as gp38 and T1α) in maintaining HEV barrier function. Mice with postnatal
deletion of Pdpn lost HEV integrity and exhibited spontaneous bleeding in mucosal
lymph nodes, and bleeding in the draining peripheral lymph nodes after
immunization. Blocking lymphocyte homing rescued bleeding, indicating that PDPN
is required to protect the barrier function of HEVs during lymphocyte
trafficking. Further analyses demonstrated that PDPN expressed on fibroblastic
reticular cells, which surround HEVs, functions as an activating ligand for
platelet C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2, also known as CLEC1B). Mice
lacking fibroblastic reticular cell PDPN or platelet CLEC-2 exhibited
significantly reduced levels of VE-cadherin (also known as CDH5), which is
essential for overall vascular integrity, on HEVs. Infusion of wild-type
platelets restored HEV integrity in Clec-2-deficient mice. Activation of CLEC-2
induced release of sphingosine-1-phosphate from platelets, which promoted
expression of VE-cadherin on HEVs ex vivo. Furthermore, draining peripheral lymph
nodes of immunized mice lacking sphingosine-1-phosphate had impaired HEV
integrity similar to Pdpn- and Clec-2-deficient mice. These data demonstrate that
local sphingosine-1-phosphate release after PDPN-CLEC-2-mediated platelet
activation is critical for HEV integrity during immune responses.

be a source of strong and sustained directional selection in the wild. In the
presence of such strong directional selection, alleles enhancing a particular
trait are predicted to become fixed within a population, leading to a decrease in
the underlying genetic variation. However, there is often considerable genetic
variation underlying sexually selected traits in wild populations, and
consequently, this phenomenon has become a long-discussed issue in the field of
evolutionary biology. In wild Soay sheep, large horns confer an advantage in
strong intra-sexual competition, yet males show an inherited polymorphism for
horn type and have substantial genetic variation in their horn size. Here we show
that most genetic variation in this trait is maintained by a trade-off between
natural and sexual selection at a single gene, relaxin-like receptor 2 (RXFP2).
We found that an allele conferring larger horns, Ho(+), is associated with higher
reproductive success, whereas a smaller horn allele, Ho(P), confers increased
survival, resulting in a net effect of overdominance (that is, heterozygote
advantage) for fitness at RXFP2. The nature of this trade-off is simple relative 
to commonly proposed explanations for the maintenance of sexually selected
traits, such as genic capture ('good genes') and sexually antagonistic selection.
Our results demonstrate that by identifying the genetic architecture of trait
variation, we can determine the principal mechanisms maintaining genetic
variation in traits under strong selection and explain apparently
counter-evolutionary observations.

Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse
neurotransmitter uptake from the synaptic cleft into the cytoplasm of glial cells
and neurons. Their mechanism of action involves transitions between extracellular
(outward)-facing and intracellular (inward)-facing conformations, whereby
substrate binding sites become accessible to either side of the membrane. This
process has been proposed to entail transmembrane movements of three discrete
transport domains within a trimeric scaffold. Using single-molecule fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging, we have directly observed large-scale
transport domain movements in a bacterial homologue of glutamate transporters. We
find that individual transport domains alternate between periods of quiescence
and periods of rapid transitions, reminiscent of bursting patterns first recorded
in single ion channels using patch-clamp methods. We propose that the switch to
the dynamic mode in glutamate transporters is due to separation of the transport 
domain from the trimeric scaffold, which precedes domain movements across the
bilayer. This spontaneous dislodging of the substrate-loaded transport domain is 
approximately 100-fold slower than subsequent transmembrane movements and may be 
rate determining in the transport cycle.

Species richness has dominated our view of global biodiversity patterns for
centuries. The dominance of this paradigm is reflected in the focus by ecologists
and conservation managers on richness and associated occurrence-based measures
for understanding drivers of broad-scale diversity patterns and as a biological
basis for management. However, this is changing rapidly, as it is now recognized 
that not only the number of species but the species present, their phenotypes and
the number of individuals of each species are critical in determining the nature 
and strength of the relationships between species diversity and a range of
ecological functions (such as biomass production and nutrient cycling).
Integrating these measures should provide a more relevant representation of
global biodiversity patterns in terms of ecological functions than that provided 
by simple species counts. Here we provide comparisons of a traditional global
biodiversity distribution measure based on richness with metrics that incorporate
species abundances and functional traits. We use data from standardized
quantitative surveys of 2,473 marine reef fish species at 1,844 sites, spanning
133 degrees of latitude from all ocean basins, to identify new diversity hotspots
in some temperate regions and the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. These relate to
high diversity of functional traits amongst individuals in the community
(calculated using Rao's Q), and differ from previously reported patterns in
functional diversity and richness for terrestrial animals, which emphasize
species-rich tropical regions only. There is a global trend for greater evenness 
in the number of individuals of each species, across the reef fish species
observed at sites ('community evenness'), at higher latitudes. This contributes
to the distribution of functional diversity hotspots and contrasts with
well-known latitudinal gradients in richness. Our findings suggest that the
contribution of species diversity to a range of ecosystem functions varies over
large scales, and imply that in tropical regions, which have higher numbers of
species, each species contributes proportionally less to community-level
ecological processes on average than species in temperate regions. Metrics of
ecological function usefully complement metrics of species diversity in
conservation management, including when identifying planning priorities and when 
tracking changes to biodiversity values.

It is widely assumed that atmospheric oxygen concentrations remained persistently
low (less than 10(-5) times present levels) for about the first 2 billion years
of Earth's history. The first long-term oxygenation of the atmosphere is thought 
to have taken place around 2.3 billion years ago, during the Great Oxidation
Event. Geochemical indications of transient atmospheric oxygenation, however,
date back to 2.6-2.7 billion years ago. Here we examine the distribution of
chromium isotopes and redox-sensitive metals in the approximately
3-billion-year-old Nsuze palaeosol and in the near-contemporaneous Ijzermyn iron 
formation from the Pongola Supergroup, South Africa. We find extensive
mobilization of redox-sensitive elements through oxidative weathering.
Furthermore, using our data we compute a best minimum estimate for atmospheric
oxygen concentrations at that time of 3 × 10(-4) times present levels. Overall,
our findings suggest that there were appreciable levels of atmospheric oxygen
about 3 billion years ago, more than 600 million years before the Great Oxidation
Event and some 300-400 million years earlier than previous indications for Earth 
surface oxygenation.

Alkane desaturation by concerted double hydrogen atom transfer to benzyne.

The removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from an alkane to produce an alkene is 
a challenge for synthetic chemists. In nature, desaturases and acetylenases are
adept at achieving this essential oxidative functionalization reaction, for
example during the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, eicosanoids,
gibberellins and carotenoids. Alkane-to-alkene conversion almost always involves 
one or more chemical intermediates in a multistep reaction pathway; these may be 
either isolable species (such as alcohols or alkyl halides) or reactive
intermediates (such as carbocations, alkyl radicals, or σ-alkyl-metal species).
Here we report a desaturation reaction of simple, unactivated alkanes that is
mechanistically unique. We show that benzynes are capable of the concerted
removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon. The discovery of this
exothermic, net redox process was enabled by the simple thermal generation of
reactive benzyne intermediates through the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder
cycloisomerization reaction of triyne substrates. We are not aware of any
single-step, bimolecular reaction in which two hydrogen atoms are simultaneously 
transferred from a saturated alkane. Computational studies indicate a preferred
geometry with eclipsed vicinal C-H bonds in the alkane donor.

The miniaturization of electronic devices has been the principal driving force
behind the semiconductor industry, and has brought about major improvements in
computational power and energy efficiency. Although advances with silicon-based
electronics continue to be made, alternative technologies are being explored.
Digital circuits based on transistors fabricated from carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
have the potential to outperform silicon by improving the energy-delay product, a
metric of energy efficiency, by more than an order of magnitude. Hence, CNTs are 
an exciting complement to existing semiconductor technologies. Owing to
substantial fundamental imperfections inherent in CNTs, however, only very basic 
circuit blocks have been demonstrated. Here we show how these imperfections can
be overcome, and demonstrate the first computer built entirely using CNT-based
transistors. The CNT computer runs an operating system that is capable of
multitasking: as a demonstration, we perform counting and integer-sorting
simultaneously. In addition, we implement 20 different instructions from the
commercial MIPS instruction set to demonstrate the generality of our CNT
computer. This experimental demonstration is the most complex carbon-based
electronic system yet realized. It is a considerable advance because CNTs are
prominent among a variety of emerging technologies that are being considered for 
the next generation of highly energy-efficient electronic systems.

It is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accrete matter
and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up to millisecond
rotational periods. During the accretion stage, the system is called a low-mass
X-ray binary, and bright X-ray emission is observed. When the rate of mass
transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, these binaries host a radio 
millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by the neutron star's rotating
magnetic field. This evolutionary model is supported by the detection of
millisecond X-ray pulsations from several accreting neutron stars and also by the
evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar. It
has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar may temporarily switch on during
periods of low mass inflow in some such systems. Only indirect evidence for this 
transition has hitherto been observed. Here we report observations of
accretion-powered, millisecond X-ray pulsations from a neutron star previously
seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. Within a few days after a month-long
X-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. This not only shows the
evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, but
also that some systems can swing between the two states on very short timescales.

The heat transport and lithospheric dynamics of early Earth are currently
explained by plate tectonic and vertical tectonic models, but these do not offer 
a global synthesis consistent with the geologic record. Here we use numerical
simulations and comparison with the geologic record to explore a heat-pipe model 
in which volcanism dominates surface heat transport. These simulations indicate
that a cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic
eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat sources over 
time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics. Consistent with model
predictions, the geologic record shows rapid volcanic resurfacing, contractional 
deformation, a low geothermal gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a
rapid decrease in heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The
heat-pipe Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which
to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate tectonics.

With the production of polar molecules in the quantum regime, long-range dipolar 
interactions are expected to facilitate understanding of strongly interacting
many-body quantum systems and to realize lattice spin models for exploring
quantum magnetism. In ordinary atomic systems, where contact interactions require
wavefunction overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be mediated by
tunnelling, through a process referred to as superexchange; however, the coupling
is relatively weak and is limited to nearest-neighbour interactions. In contrast,
dipolar interactions exist even in the absence of tunnelling and extend beyond
nearest neighbours. This allows coherent spin dynamics to persist even for gases 
with relatively high entropy and low lattice filling. Measured effects of dipolar
interactions in ultracold molecular gases have been limited to the modification
of inelastic collisions and chemical reactions. Here we use dipolar interactions 
of polar molecules pinned in a three-dimensional optical lattice to realize a
lattice spin model. Spin is encoded in rotational states of molecules that are
prepared and probed by microwaves. Resonant exchange of rotational angular
momentum between two molecules realizes a spin-exchange interaction. The dipolar 
interactions are apparent in the evolution of the spin coherence, which shows
oscillations in addition to an overall decay of the coherence. The frequency of
these oscillations, the strong dependence of the spin coherence time on the
lattice filling factor and the effect of a multipulse sequence designed to
reverse dynamics due to two-body exchange interactions all provide evidence of
dipolar interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the suppression of loss in weak
lattices due to a continuous quantum Zeno mechanism. Measurements of these
tunnelling-induced losses allow us to determine the lattice filling factor
independently. Our work constitutes an initial exploration of the behaviour of
many-body spin models with direct, long-range spin interactions and lays the
groundwork for future studies of many-body dynamics in spin lattices.

Genome sequencing projects are discovering millions of genetic variants in
humans, and interpretation of their functional effects is essential for
understanding the genetic basis of variation in human traits. Here we report
sequencing and deep analysis of messenger RNA and microRNA from lymphoblastoid
cell lines of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project--the first uniformly 
processed high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from multiple human populations
with high-quality genome sequences. We discover extremely widespread genetic
variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and
expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely
independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on
the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows 
us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci.
Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms
of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the
human genome.

Two replication fork maintenance pathways fuse inverted repeats to rearrange
chromosomes.

Replication fork maintenance pathways preserve chromosomes, but their faulty
application at nonallelic repeats could generate rearrangements causing cancer,
genomic disorders and speciation. Potential causal mechanisms are homologous
recombination and error-free postreplication repair (EF-PRR). Homologous
recombination repairs damage-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and
single-ended DSBs within replication. To facilitate homologous recombination, the
recombinase RAD51 and mediator BRCA2 form a filament on the 3' DNA strand at a
break to enable annealing to the complementary sister chromatid while the RecQ
helicase, BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated) suppresses crossing over to prevent
recombination. Homologous recombination also stabilizes and restarts replication 
forks without a DSB. EF-PRR bypasses DNA incongruities that impede replication by
ubiquitinating PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) using the RAD6-RAD18 and
UBC13-MMS2-RAD5 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Some components are common to both
homologous recombination and EF-PRR such as RAD51 and RAD18. Here we delineate
two pathways that spontaneously fuse inverted repeats to generate unstable
chromosomal rearrangements in wild-type mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.
Gamma-radiation induced a BLM-regulated pathway that selectively fused identical,
but not mismatched, repeats. By contrast, ultraviolet light induced a
RAD18-dependent pathway that efficiently fused mismatched repeats. Furthermore,
TREX2 (a 3'→5' exonuclease) suppressed identical repeat fusion but enhanced
mismatched repeat fusion, clearly separating these pathways. TREX2 associated
with UBC13 and enhanced PCNA ubiquitination in response to ultraviolet light,
consistent with it being a novel member of EF-PRR. RAD18 and TREX2 also
suppressed replication fork stalling in response to nucleotide depletion.
Interestingly, replication fork stalling induced fusion for identical and
mismatched repeats, implicating faulty replication as a causal mechanism for both
pathways.

Ubiquitin-mediated targeting of intracellular bacteria to the autophagy pathway
is a key innate defence mechanism against invading microbes, including the
important human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the ubiquitin
ligases responsible for catalysing ubiquitin chains that surround intracellular
bacteria are poorly understood. The parkin protein is a ubiquitin ligase with a
well-established role in mitophagy, and mutations in the parkin gene (PARK2) lead
to increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Surprisingly, genetic
polymorphisms in the PARK2 regulatory region are also associated with increased
susceptibility to intracellular bacterial pathogens in humans, including
Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, but the function of
parkin in immunity has remained unexplored. Here we show that parkin has a role
in ubiquitin-mediated autophagy of M. tuberculosis. Both parkin-deficient mice
and flies are sensitive to various intracellular bacterial infections, indicating
parkin has a conserved role in metazoan innate defence. Moreover, our work
reveals an unexpected functional link between mitophagy and infectious disease.

Sodium/proton (Na(+)/H(+)) antiporters, located at the plasma membrane in every
cell, are vital for cell homeostasis. In humans, their dysfunction has been
linked to diseases, such as hypertension, heart failure and epilepsy, and they
are well-established drug targets. The best understood model system for
Na(+)/H(+) antiport is NhaA from Escherichia coli, for which both electron
microscopy and crystal structures are available. NhaA is made up of two distinct 
domains: a core domain and a dimerization domain. In the NhaA crystal structure a
cavity is located between the two domains, providing access to the ion-binding
site from the inward-facing surface of the protein. Like many Na(+)/H(+)
antiporters, the activity of NhaA is regulated by pH, only becoming active above 
pH 6.5, at which point a conformational change is thought to occur. The only
reported NhaA crystal structure so far is of the low pH inactivated form. Here we
describe the active-state structure of a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, NapA from Thermus
thermophilus, at 3 Å resolution, solved from crystals grown at pH 7.8. In the
NapA structure, the core and dimerization domains are in different positions to
those seen in NhaA, and a negatively charged cavity has now opened to the
outside. The extracellular cavity allows access to a strictly conserved aspartate
residue thought to coordinate ion binding directly, a role supported here by
molecular dynamics simulations. To alternate access to this ion-binding site,
however, requires a surprisingly large rotation of the core domain, some 20°
against the dimerization interface. We conclude that despite their fast transport
rates of up to 1,500 ions per second, Na(+)/H(+) antiporters operate by a
two-domain rocking bundle model, revealing themes relevant to secondary-active
transporters in general.

A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual
cortex.

Early sensory experience instructs the maturation of neural circuitry in the
cortex. This has been studied extensively in the primary visual cortex, in which 
loss of vision to one eye permanently degrades cortical responsiveness to that
eye, a phenomenon known as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). Cortical inhibition
mediates this process, but the precise role of specific classes of inhibitory
neurons in ODP is controversial. Here we report that evoked firing rates of
binocular excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex immediately drop by
half when vision is restricted to one eye, but gradually return to normal over
the following twenty-four hours, despite the fact that vision remains restricted 
to one eye. This restoration of binocular-like excitatory firing rates after
monocular deprivation results from a rapid, although transient, reduction in the 
firing rates of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which in
turn can be attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit input onto PV
interneurons. This reduction in PV-cell-evoked responses after monocular lid
suture is restricted to the critical period for ODP and appears to be necessary
for subsequent shifts in excitatory ODP. Pharmacologically enhancing inhibition
at the time of sight deprivation blocks ODP and, conversely, pharmacogenetic
reduction of PV cell firing rates can extend the critical period for ODP. These
findings define the microcircuit changes initiating competitive plasticity during
critical periods of cortical development. Moreover, they show that the
restoration of evoked firing rates of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons by PV-specific 
disinhibition is a key step in the progression of ODP.

Mammalian genomes contain several billion base pairs of DNA that are packaged in 
chromatin fibres. At selected gene loci, cohesin complexes have been proposed to 
arrange these fibres into higher-order structures, but how important this
function is for determining overall chromosome architecture and how the process
is regulated are not well understood. Using conditional mutagenesis in the mouse,
here we show that depletion of the cohesin-associated protein Wapl stably locks
cohesin on DNA, leads to clustering of cohesin in axial structures, and causes
chromatin condensation in interphase chromosomes. These findings reveal that the 
stability of cohesin-DNA interactions is an important determinant of chromatin
structure, and indicate that cohesin has an architectural role in interphase
chromosome territories. Furthermore, we show that regulation of cohesin-DNA
interactions by Wapl is important for embryonic development, expression of genes 
such as c-myc (also known as Myc), and cell cycle progression. In mitosis,
Wapl-mediated release of cohesin from DNA is essential for proper chromosome
segregation and protects cohesin from cleavage by the protease separase, thus
enabling mitotic exit in the presence of functional cohesin complexes.

Wild waterfowl form the main reservoir of influenza A viruses, from which
transmission occurs directly or indirectly to various secondary hosts, including 
humans. Direct avian-to-human transmission has been observed for viruses of
subtypes A(H5N1), A(H7N2), A(H7N3), A(H7N7), A(H9N2) and A(H10N7) upon human
exposure to poultry, but a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission has
prevented these viruses from causing new pandemics. Recently, avian A(H7N9)
viruses were transmitted to humans, causing severe respiratory disease and deaths
in China. Because transmission via respiratory droplets and aerosols (hereafter
referred to as airborne transmission) is the main route for efficient
transmission between humans, it is important to gain an insight into airborne
transmission of the A(H7N9) virus. Here we show that although the A/Anhui/1/2013 
A(H7N9) virus harbours determinants associated with human adaptation and
transmissibility between mammals, its airborne transmissibility in ferrets is
limited, and it is intermediate between that of typical human and avian influenza
viruses. Multiple A(H7N9) virus genetic variants were transmitted. Upon ferret
passage, variants with higher avian receptor binding, higher pH of fusion, and
lower thermostability were selected, potentially resulting in reduced
transmissibility. This A(H7N9) virus outbreak highlights the need for increased
understanding of the determinants of efficient airborne transmission of avian
influenza viruses between mammals.

The BC component of ABC toxins is an RHS-repeat-containing protein encapsulation 
device.

University of Auckland, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.

The ABC toxin complexes produced by certain bacteria are of interest owing to
their potent insecticidal activity and potential role in human disease. These
complexes comprise at least three proteins (A, B and C), which must assemble to
be fully toxic. The carboxy-terminal region of the C protein is the main
cytotoxic component, and is poorly conserved between different toxin complexes. A
general model of action has been proposed, in which the toxin complex binds to
the cell surface via the A protein, is endocytosed, and subsequently forms a
pH-triggered channel, allowing the translocation of C into the cytoplasm, where
it can cause cytoskeletal disruption in both insect and mammalian cells. Toxin
complexes have been visualized using single-particle electron microscopy, but no 
high-resolution structures of the components are available, and the role of the B
protein in the mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Here we report the
three-dimensional structure of the complex formed between the B and C proteins,
determined to 2.5 Å by X-ray crystallography. These proteins assemble to form an 
unprecedented, large hollow structure that encapsulates and sequesters the
cytotoxic, C-terminal region of the C protein like the shell of an egg. The shell
is decorated on one end by a β-propeller domain, which mediates attachment of the
B-C heterodimer to the A protein in the native complex. The structure reveals how
C auto-proteolyses when folded in complex with B. The C protein is the first
example, to our knowledge, of a structure that contains rearrangement hotspot
(RHS) repeats, and illustrates a marked structural architecture that is probably 
conserved across both this widely distributed bacterial protein family and the
related eukaryotic tyrosine-aspartate (YD)-repeat-containing protein family,
which includes the teneurins. The structure provides the first clues about the
function of these protein repeat families, and suggests a generic mechanism for
protein encapsulation and delivery.

On 29 March 2013, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed
the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.
The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39
fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is concerning because H7 viruses have 
typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe
respiratory disease. This recent outbreak underscores the need to better
understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we
assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses,
isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to
transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human 
airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a
seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and
lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9
viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but,
unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets.
The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low
receptor-binding specificity for human-like α2,6-linked sialosides. Our results
indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals
and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health
surveillance of this emerging virus.

Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect humans; however, when human infection and
subsequent human-to-human transmission occurs, worldwide outbreaks (pandemics)
can result. The recent sporadic infections of humans in China with a previously
unrecognized avian influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype (A(H7N9)) have caused
concern owing to the appreciable case fatality rate associated with these
infections (more than 25%), potential instances of human-to-human transmission,
and the lack of pre-existing immunity among humans to viruses of this subtype.
Here we characterize two early human A(H7N9) isolates, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and 
A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9); hereafter referred to as Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1,
respectively. In mice, Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 were more pathogenic than a control
avian H7N9 virus (A/duck/Gunma/466/2011 (H7N9); Dk/GM466) and a representative
pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (A/California/4/2009 (H1N1pdm09); CA04). Anhui/1,
Shanghai/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated well in the nasal turbinates of ferrets. In
nonhuman primates, Anhui/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated efficiently in the upper and
lower respiratory tracts, whereas the replicative ability of conventional human
influenza viruses is typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract of
infected primates. By contrast, Anhui/1 did not replicate well in miniature pigs 
after intranasal inoculation. Critically, Anhui/1 transmitted through respiratory
droplets in one of three pairs of ferrets. Glycan arrays showed that Anhui/1,
Shanghai/1 and A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9) (a third human A(H7N9) virus tested in
this assay) bind to human virus-type receptors, a property that may be critical
for virus transmissibility in ferrets. Anhui/1 was found to be less sensitive in 
mice to neuraminidase inhibitors than a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, although both
viruses were equally susceptible to an experimental antiviral polymerase
inhibitor. The robust replicative ability in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates 
and the limited transmissibility in ferrets of Anhui/1 suggest that A(H7N9)
viruses have pandemic potential.

Diapycnal mixing (across density surfaces) is an important process in the global 
ocean overturning circulation. Mixing in the interior of most of the ocean,
however, is thought to have a magnitude just one-tenth of that required to close 
the global circulation by the downward mixing of less dense waters. Some of this 
deficit is made up by intense near-bottom mixing occurring in restricted
'hot-spots' associated with rough ocean-floor topography, but it is not clear
whether the waters at mid-depth, 1,000 to 3,000 metres, are returned to the
surface by cross-density mixing or by along-density flows. Here we show that
diapycnal mixing of mid-depth (∼1,500 metres) waters undergoes a sustained
20-fold increase as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows through the Drake
Passage, between the southern tip of South America and Antarctica. Our results
are based on an open-ocean tracer release of trifluoromethyl sulphur
pentafluoride. We ascribe the increased mixing to turbulence generated by the
deep-reaching Antarctic Circumpolar Current as it flows over rough bottom
topography in the Drake Passage. Scaled to the entire circumpolar current, the
mixing we observe is compatible with there being a southern component to the
global overturning in which about 20 sverdrups (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) upwell
in the Southern Ocean, with cross-density mixing contributing a significant
fraction (20 to 30 per cent) of this total, and the remainder upwelling along
constant-density surfaces. The great majority of the diapycnal flux is the result
of interaction with restricted regions of rough ocean-floor topography.

Cancer is often regarded as a process of asexual evolution driven by genomic and 
genetic instability. Mutation, selection and adaptation are by convention thought
to occur primarily within, and to a lesser degree outside, the primary tumour.
However, disseminated cancer cells that remain after 'curative' surgery exhibit
extreme genomic heterogeneity before the manifestation of metastasis. This
heterogeneity is later reduced by selected clonal expansion, suggesting that the 
disseminated cells had yet to acquire key traits of fully malignant cells.
Abrogation of the cells' progression outside the primary tumour implies new
challenges and opportunities for diagnosis and adjuvant therapies.

Recent therapeutic advances in oncology have been driven by the identification of
tumour genotype variations between patients, called interpatient heterogeneity,
that predict the response of patients to targeted treatments. Subpopulations of
cancer cells with unique genomes in the same patient may exist across different
geographical regions of a tumour or evolve over time, called intratumour
heterogeneity. Sequencing technologies can be used to characterize intratumour
heterogeneity at diagnosis, monitor clonal dynamics during treatment and identify
the emergence of clinical resistance during disease progression. Genetic
interpatient and intratumour heterogeneity can pose challenges for the design of 
clinical trials that use these data.

Tumour formation involves the co-evolution of neoplastic cells together with
extracellular matrix, tumour vasculature and immune cells. Successful outgrowth
of tumours and eventual metastasis is not determined solely by genetic
alterations in tumour cells, but also by the fitness advantage such mutations
confer in a given environment. As fitness is context dependent, evaluating
tumours as complete organs, and not simply as masses of transformed epithelial
cells, becomes paramount. The dynamic tumour topography varies drastically even
throughout the same lesion. Heterologous cell types within tumours can actively
influence therapeutic response and shape resistance.

Recent studies have revealed extensive genetic diversity both between and within 
tumours. This heterogeneity affects key cancer pathways, driving phenotypic
variation, and poses a significant challenge to personalized cancer medicine. A
major cause of genetic heterogeneity in cancer is genomic instability. This
instability leads to an increased mutation rate and can shape the evolution of
the cancer genome through a plethora of mechanisms. By understanding these
mechanisms we can gain insight into the common pathways of tumour evolution that 
could support the development of future therapeutic strategies.

Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity arise among cancer cells within the same 
tumour as a consequence of genetic change, environmental differences and
reversible changes in cell properties. Some cancers also contain a hierarchy in
which tumorigenic cancer stem cells differentiate into non-tumorigenic progeny.
However, it remains unclear what fraction of cancers follow the stem-cell model
and what clinical behaviours the model explains. Studies using lineage tracing
and deep sequencing could have implications for the cancer stem-cell model and
may help to determine the extent to which it accounts for therapy resistance and 
disease progression.

Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale
solar energy conversion. The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices
have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched
between two charge-selective contacts and nanostructured (or mesostructured)
solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to
transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases. Although
many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining
high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved.
Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for 
high-efficiency nanostructured devices. Here we show that nanostructuring is not 
necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar
heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the
absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of
over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight). This demonstrates
that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified 
device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.

Down's syndrome results from full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. However,
the consequences of the underlying gene-dosage imbalance on adult tissues remain 
poorly understood. Here we show that in Ts65Dn mice, which are trisomic for 132
genes homologous to genes on human chromosome 21, triplication of Usp16 reduces
the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells and the expansion of mammary
epithelial cells, neural progenitors and fibroblasts. In addition, Usp16 is
associated with decreased ubiquitination of Cdkn2a and accelerated senescence in 
Ts65Dn fibroblasts. Usp16 can remove ubiquitin from histone H2A on lysine 119, a 
critical mark for the maintenance of multiple somatic tissues. Downregulation of 
Usp16, either by mutation of a single normal Usp16 allele or by short interfering
RNAs, largely rescues all of these defects. Furthermore, in human tissues
overexpression of USP16 reduces the expansion of normal fibroblasts and postnatal
neural progenitors, whereas downregulation of USP16 partially rescues the
proliferation defects of Down's syndrome fibroblasts. Taken together, these
results suggest that USP16 has an important role in antagonizing the self-renewal
and/or senescence pathways in Down's syndrome and could serve as an attractive
target to ameliorate some of the associated pathologies.

Noble-metal nanoparticles have had a substantial impact across a diverse range of
fields, including catalysis, sensing, photochemistry, optoelectronics, energy
conversion and medicine. Although silver has very desirable physical properties, 
good relative abundance and low cost, gold nanoparticles have been widely
favoured owing to their proved stability and ease of use. Unlike gold, silver is 
notorious for its susceptibility to oxidation (tarnishing), which has limited the
development of important silver-based nanomaterials. Despite two decades of
synthetic efforts, silver nanoparticles that are inert or have long-term
stability remain unrealized. Here we report a simple synthetic protocol for
producing ultrastable silver nanoparticles, yielding a single-sized molecular
product in very large quantities with quantitative yield and without the need for
size sorting. The stability, purity and yield are substantially better than those
for other metal nanoparticles, including gold, owing to an effective
stabilization mechanism. The particular size and stoichiometry of the product
were found to be insensitive to variations in synthesis parameters. The chemical 
stability and structural, electronic and optical properties can be understood
using first-principles electronic structure theory based on an experimental
single-crystal X-ray structure. Although several structures have been determined 
for protected gold nanoclusters, none has been reported so far for silver
nanoparticles. The total structure of a thiolate-protected silver nanocluster
reported here uncovers the unique structure of the silver thiolate protecting
layer, consisting of Ag2S5 capping structures. The outstanding stability of the
nanoparticle is attributed to a closed-shell 18-electron configuration with a
large energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital, an ultrastable 32-silver-atom
excavated-dodecahedral core consisting of a hollow 12-silver-atom icosahedron
encapsulated by a 20-silver-atom dodecahedron, and the choice of protective
coordinating ligands. The straightforward synthesis of large quantities of pure
molecular product promises to make this class of materials widely available for
further research and technology development.

Despite the continued increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the 
annual-mean global temperature has not risen in the twenty-first century,
challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes climate
warming. Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming,
but their relative importance has not been quantified, hampering observational
estimates of climate sensitivity. Here we show that accounting for recent cooling
in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and
observations. We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global
temperature change by prescribing, in addition to radiative forcing, the observed
history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific
in a climate model. Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to
only 8.2% of the global surface, our model reproduces the annual-mean global
temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r = 0.97 for 1970-2012
(which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming).
Moreover, our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of 
the hiatus, including the intensified Walker circulation, the winter cooling in
northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern USA. Our
results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied
specifically to a La-Niña-like decadal cooling. Although similar decadal hiatus
events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to
continue with greenhouse gas increase.

β-barrel membrane proteins are essential for nutrient import, signalling,
motility and survival. In Gram-negative bacteria, the β-barrel assembly machinery
(BAM) complex is responsible for the biogenesis of β-barrel membrane proteins,
with homologous complexes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we
describe the structure of BamA, the central and essential component of the BAM
complex, from two species of bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus
ducreyi. BamA consists of a large periplasmic domain attached to a 16-strand
transmembrane β-barrel domain. Three structural features shed light on the
mechanism by which BamA catalyses β-barrel assembly. First, the interior cavity
is accessible in one BamA structure and conformationally closed in the other.
Second, an exterior rim of the β-barrel has a distinctly narrowed hydrophobic
surface, locally destabilizing the outer membrane. And third, the β-barrel can
undergo lateral opening, suggesting a route from the interior cavity in BamA into
the outer membrane.

The complexity of the human brain has made it difficult to study many brain
disorders in model organisms, highlighting the need for an in vitro model of
human brain development. Here we have developed a human pluripotent stem
cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system, termed cerebral
organoids, that develop various discrete, although interdependent, brain regions.
These include a cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations that organize
and produce mature cortical neuron subtypes. Furthermore, cerebral organoids are 
shown to recapitulate features of human cortical development, namely
characteristic progenitor zone organization with abundant outer radial glial stem
cells. Finally, we use RNA interference and patient-specific induced pluripotent 
stem cells to model microcephaly, a disorder that has been difficult to
recapitulate in mice. We demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation in
patient organoids, a defect that could help to explain the disease phenotype.
Together, these data show that three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate
development and disease even in this most complex human tissue.

Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.

The KCNH voltage-dependent potassium channels (ether-à-go-go, EAG; EAG-related
gene, ERG; EAG-like channels, ELK) are important regulators of cellular
excitability and have key roles in diseases such as cardiac long QT syndrome type
2 (LQT2), epilepsy, schizophrenia and cancer. The intracellular domains of KCNH
channels are structurally distinct from other voltage-gated channels. The
amino-terminal region contains an eag domain, which is composed of a Per-Arnt-Sim
(PAS) domain and a PAS-cap domain, whereas the carboxy-terminal region contains a
cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which is connected to the pore
through a C-linker domain. Many disease-causing mutations localize to these
specialized intracellular domains, which underlie the unique gating and
regulation of KCNH channels. It has been suggested that the eag domain may
regulate the channel by interacting with either the S4-S5 linker or the CNBHD.
Here we present a 2 Å resolution crystal structure of the eag domain-CNBHD
complex of the mouse EAG1 (also known as KCNH1) channel. It displays extensive
interactions between the eag domain and the CNBHD, indicating that the regulatory
mechanism of the eag domain primarily involves the CNBHD. Notably, the structure 
reveals that a number of LQT2 mutations at homologous positions in human ERG, in 
addition to cancer-associated mutations in EAG channels, localize to the eag
domain-CNBHD interface. Furthermore, mutations at the interface produced marked
effects on channel gating, demonstrating the important physiological role of the 
eag domain-CNBHD interaction. Our structure of the eag domain-CNBHD complex of
mouse EAG1 provides unique insights into the physiological and pathophysiological
mechanisms of KCNH channels.

DNA damage responses have been well characterized with regard to their
cell-autonomous checkpoint functions leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence and
apoptosis. In contrast, systemic responses to tissue-specific genome instability 
remain poorly understood. In adult Caenorhabditis elegans worms germ cells
undergo mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, whereas somatic tissues are entirely 
post-mitotic. Consequently, DNA damage checkpoints function specifically in the
germ line, whereas somatic tissues in adult C. elegans are highly
radio-resistant. Some DNA repair systems such as global-genome nucleotide
excision repair (GG-NER) remove lesions specifically in germ cells. Here we
investigated how genome instability in germ cells affects somatic tissues in C.
elegans. We show that exogenous and endogenous DNA damage in germ cells evokes
elevated resistance to heat and oxidative stress. The somatic stress resistance
is mediated by the ERK MAP kinase MPK-1 in germ cells that triggers the induction
of putative secreted peptides associated with innate immunity. The innate immune 
response leads to activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in somatic 
tissues, which confers enhanced proteostasis and systemic stress resistance. We
propose that elevated systemic stress resistance promotes endurance of somatic
tissues to allow delay of progeny production when germ cells are genomically
compromised.

Ageing is due to an accumulation of various types of damage, and mitochondrial
dysfunction has long been considered to be important in this process. There is
substantial sequence variation in mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the
high mutation rate is counteracted by different mechanisms that decrease maternal
transmission of mutated mtDNA. Despite these protective mechanisms, it is
becoming increasingly clear that low-level mtDNA heteroplasmy is quite common and
often inherited in humans. We designed a series of mouse mutants to investigate
the extent to which inherited mtDNA mutations can contribute to ageing. Here we
report that maternally transmitted mtDNA mutations can induce mild ageing
phenotypes in mice with a wild-type nuclear genome. Furthermore, maternally
transmitted mtDNA mutations lead to anticipation of reduced fertility in mice
that are heterozygous for the mtDNA mutator allele (PolgA(wt/mut)) and aggravate 
premature ageing phenotypes in mtDNA mutator mice (PolgA(mut/mut)). Unexpectedly,
a combination of maternally transmitted and somatic mtDNA mutations also leads to
stochastic brain malformations. Our findings show that a pre-existing mutation
load will not only allow somatic mutagenesis to create a critically high total
mtDNA mutation load sooner but will also increase clonal expansion of mtDNA
mutations to enhance the normally occurring mosaic respiratory chain deficiency
in ageing tissues. Our findings suggest that maternally transmitted mtDNA
mutations may have a similar role in aggravating aspects of normal human ageing.

The African parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for 97% of human
sleeping sickness cases. T. b. gambiense resists the specific human innate
immunity acting against several other tsetse-fly-transmitted trypanosome species 
such as T. b. brucei, the causative agent of nagana disease in cattle. Human
immunity to some African trypanosomes is due to two serum complexes designated
trypanolytic factors (TLF-1 and -2), which both contain haptoglobin-related
protein (HPR) and apolipoprotein LI (APOL1). Whereas HPR association with
haemoglobin (Hb) allows TLF-1 binding and uptake via the trypanosome receptor
TbHpHbR (ref. 5), TLF-2 enters trypanosomes independently of TbHpHbR (refs 4, 5).
APOL1 kills trypanosomes after insertion into endosomal/lysosomal membranes. Here
we report that T. b. gambiense resists TLFs via a hydrophobic β-sheet of the T.
b. gambiense-specific glycoprotein (TgsGP), which prevents APOL1 toxicity and
induces stiffening of membranes upon interaction with lipids. Two additional
features contribute to resistance to TLFs: reduction of sensitivity to APOL1
requiring cysteine protease activity, and TbHpHbR inactivation due to a L210S
substitution. According to such a multifactorial defence mechanism, transgenic
expression of T. b. brucei TbHpHbR in T. b. gambiense did not cause parasite
lysis in normal human serum. However, these transgenic parasites were killed in
hypohaptoglobinaemic serum, after high TLF-1 uptake in the absence of haptoglobin
(Hp) that competes for Hb and receptor binding. TbHpHbR inactivation preventing
high APOL1 loading in hypohaptoglobinaemic serum may have evolved because of the 
overlapping endemic area of T. b. gambiense infection and malaria, the main cause
of haemolysis-induced hypohaptoglobinaemia in western and central Africa.

Mammals harbour a complex gut microbiome, comprising bacteria that confer
immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits. Despite advances in
sequence-based microbial profiling and myriad studies defining microbiome
composition during health and disease, little is known about the molecular
processes used by symbiotic bacteria to stably colonize the gastrointestinal
tract. We sought to define how mammals assemble and maintain the Bacteroides, one
of the most numerically prominent genera of the human microbiome. Here we find
that, whereas the gut normally contains hundreds of bacterial species, germ-free 
mice mono-associated with a single Bacteroides species are resistant to
colonization by the same, but not different, species. To identify bacterial
mechanisms for species-specific saturable colonization, we devised an in vivo
genetic screen and discovered a unique class of polysaccharide utilization loci
that is conserved among intestinal Bacteroides. We named this genetic locus the
commensal colonization factors (ccf). Deletion of the ccf genes in the model
symbiont, Bacteroides fragilis, results in colonization defects in mice and
reduced horizontal transmission. The ccf genes of B. fragilis are upregulated
during gut colonization, preferentially at the colonic surface. When we visualize
microbial biogeography within the colon, B. fragilis penetrates the colonic mucus
and resides deep within crypt channels, whereas ccf mutants are defective in
crypt association. Notably, the CCF system is required for B. fragilis
colonization following microbiome disruption with Citrobacter rodentium infection
or antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the niche within colonic crypts
represents a reservoir for bacteria to maintain long-term colonization. These
findings reveal that intestinal Bacteroides have evolved species-specific
physical interactions with the host that mediate stable and resilient gut
colonization, and the CCF system represents a novel molecular mechanism for
symbiosis.

Broadly neutralizing antibodies reactive against most and even all variants of
the same viral species have been described for influenza and HIV-1 (ref. 1).
However, whether a neutralizing antibody could have the breadth of range to
target different viral species was unknown. Human respiratory syncytial virus
(HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are common pathogens that cause severe
disease in premature newborns, hospitalized children and immune-compromised
patients, and play a role in asthma exacerbations. Although antisera generated
against either HRSV or HMPV are not cross-neutralizing, we speculated that,
because of the repeated exposure to these viruses, cross-neutralizing antibodies 
may be selected in some individuals. Here we describe a human monoclonal antibody
(MPE8) that potently cross-neutralizes HRSV and HMPV as well as two animal
paramyxoviruses: bovine RSV (BRSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). In its
germline configuration, MPE8 is HRSV-specific and its breadth is achieved by
somatic mutations in the light chain variable region. MPE8 did not result in the 
selection of viral escape mutants that evaded antibody targeting and showed
potent prophylactic efficacy in animal models of HRSV and HMPV infection, as well
as prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the more relevant model of lethal PVM
infection. The core epitope of MPE8 was mapped on two highly conserved
anti-parallel β-strands on the pre-fusion viral F protein, which are rearranged
in the post-fusion F protein conformation. Twenty-six out of the thirty
HRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies isolated were also found to be specific for
the pre-fusion F protein. Taken together, these results indicate that MPE8 might 
be used for the prophylaxis and therapy of severe HRSV and HMPV infections and
identify the pre-fusion F protein as a candidate HRSV vaccine.

Activated oncogenes and anticancer chemotherapy induce cellular senescence, a
terminal growth arrest of viable cells characterized by S-phase entry-blocking
histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Although therapy-induced senescence 
(TIS) improves long-term outcomes, potentially harmful properties of senescent
tumour cells make their quantitative elimination a therapeutic priority. Here we 
use the Eµ-myc transgenic mouse lymphoma model in which TIS depends on the H3K9
histone methyltransferase Suv39h1 to show the mechanism and therapeutic
exploitation of senescence-related metabolic reprogramming in vitro and in vivo. 
After senescence-inducing chemotherapy, TIS-competent lymphomas but not
TIS-incompetent Suv39h1(-) lymphomas show increased glucose utilization and much 
higher ATP production. We demonstrate that this is linked to massive proteotoxic 
stress, which is a consequence of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) described previously. SASP-producing TIS cells exhibited endoplasmic
reticulum stress, an unfolded protein response (UPR), and increased
ubiquitination, thereby targeting toxic proteins for autophagy in an acutely
energy-consuming fashion. Accordingly, TIS lymphomas, unlike senescence models
that lack a strong SASP response, were more sensitive to blocking glucose
utilization or autophagy, which led to their selective elimination through
caspase-12- and caspase-3-mediated endoplasmic-reticulum-related apoptosis.
Consequently, pharmacological targeting of these metabolic demands on TIS
induction in vivo prompted tumour regression and improved treatment outcomes
further. These findings unveil the hypercatabolic nature of TIS that is
therapeutically exploitable by synthetic lethal metabolic targeting.

Earth's nearest candidate supermassive black hole lies at the centre of the Milky
Way. Its electromagnetic emission is thought to be powered by radiatively
inefficient accretion of gas from its environment, which is a standard mode of
energy supply for most galactic nuclei. X-ray measurements have already resolved 
a tenuous hot gas component from which the black hole can be fed. The
magnetization of the gas, however, which is a crucial parameter determining the
structure of the accretion flow, remains unknown. Strong magnetic fields can
influence the dynamics of accretion, remove angular momentum from the infalling
gas, expel matter through relativistic jets and lead to synchrotron emission such
as that previously observed. Here we report multi-frequency radio measurements of
a newly discovered pulsar close to the Galactic Centre and show that the pulsar's
unusually large Faraday rotation (the rotation of the plane of polarization of
the emission in the presence of an external magnetic field) indicates that there 
is a dynamically important magnetic field near the black hole. If this field is
accreted down to the event horizon it provides enough magnetic flux to explain
the observed emission--from radio to X-ray wavelengths--from the black hole.

Jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes) have
different adaptive immune systems. Gnathostomes use T- and B-cell antigen
receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Cyclostomes, the lampreys 
and hagfish, instead use leucine-rich repeat proteins to construct variable
lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), two types of which, VLRA and VLRB, are reciprocally 
expressed by lymphocytes resembling gnathostome T and B cells. Here we define
another lineage of T-cell-like lymphocytes that express the recently identified
VLRC receptors. Both VLRC(+) and VLRA(+) lymphocytes express orthologues of genes
that gnathostome γδ and αβ T cells use for their differentiation, undergo VLRC
and VLRA assembly and repertoire diversification in the 'thymoid' gill region,
and express their VLRs solely as cell-surface proteins. Our findings suggest that
the genetic programmes for two primordial T-cell lineages and a prototypic B-cell
lineage were already present in the last common vertebrate ancestor approximately
500 million years ago. We propose that functional specialization of distinct
T-cell-like lineages was an ancient feature of a primordial immune system.

Successful infection by enteric bacterial pathogens depends on the ability of the
bacteria to colonize the gut, replicate in host tissues and disseminate to other 
hosts. Pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella and enteropathogenic and
enterohaemorrhagic (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) Escherichia coli use a type III 
secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence effector proteins into host cells
during infection that promote colonization and interfere with antimicrobial host 
responses. Here we report that the T3SS effector NleB1 from EPEC binds to host
cell death-domain-containing proteins and thereby inhibits death receptor
signalling. Protein interaction studies identified FADD, TRADD and RIPK1 as
binding partners of NleB1. NleB1 expressed ectopically or injected by the
bacterial T3SS prevented Fas ligand or TNF-induced formation of the canonical
death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and proteolytic activation of caspase-8,
an essential step in death-receptor-induced apoptosis. This inhibition depended
on the N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity of NleB1, which specifically
modified Arg 117 in the death domain of FADD. The importance of the death
receptor apoptotic pathway to host defence was demonstrated using mice deficient 
in the FAS signalling pathway, which showed delayed clearance of the EPEC-like
mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium and reversion to virulence of an nleB
mutant. The activity of NleB suggests that EPEC and other attaching and effacing 
pathogens antagonize death-receptor-induced apoptosis of infected cells, thereby 
blocking a major antimicrobial host response.

Groundwater drawn daily from shallow alluvial sands by millions of wells over
large areas of south and southeast Asia exposes an estimated population of over a
hundred million people to toxic levels of arsenic. Holocene aquifers are the
source of widespread arsenic poisoning across the region. In contrast,
Pleistocene sands deposited in this region more than 12,000 years ago mostly do
not host groundwater with high levels of arsenic. Pleistocene aquifers are
increasingly used as a safe source of drinking water and it is therefore
important to understand under what conditions low levels of arsenic can be
maintained. Here we reconstruct the initial phase of contamination of a
Pleistocene aquifer near Hanoi, Vietnam. We demonstrate that changes in
groundwater flow conditions and the redox state of the aquifer sands induced by
groundwater pumping caused the lateral intrusion of arsenic contamination more
than 120 metres from a Holocene aquifer into a previously uncontaminated
Pleistocene aquifer. We also find that arsenic adsorbs onto the aquifer sands and
that there is a 16-20-fold retardation in the extent of the contamination
relative to the reconstructed lateral movement of groundwater over the same
period. Our findings suggest that arsenic contamination of Pleistocene aquifers
in south and southeast Asia as a consequence of increasing levels of groundwater 
pumping may have been delayed by the retardation of arsenic transport.

The SN2 reaction (bimolecular nucleophilic substitution) is a well-known chemical
transformation that can be used to join two smaller molecules together into a
larger molecule or to exchange one functional group for another. The SN2 reaction
proceeds in a very predictable manner: substitution occurs with inversion of
stereochemistry, resulting from the 'backside attack' of the electrophilic carbon
by the nucleophile. A significant limitation of the SN2 reaction is its
intolerance for tertiary carbon atoms: whereas primary and secondary alcohols are
viable precursor substrates, tertiary alcohols and their derivatives usually
either fail to react or produce stereochemical mixtures of products. Here we
report the stereochemical inversion of chiral tertiary alcohols with a
nitrogenous nucleophile facilitated by a Lewis-acid-catalysed solvolysis. The
method is chemoselective against secondary and primary alcohols, thereby
complementing the selectivity of the SN2 reaction. Furthermore, this method for
carbon-nitrogen bond formation mimics a putative biosynthetic step in the
synthesis of marine terpenoids and enables their preparation from the
corresponding terrestrial terpenes. We expect that the general attributes of the 
methodology will allow chiral tertiary alcohols to be considered viable
substrates for stereoinversion reactions.

Social behaviours in species as diverse as honey bees and humans promote group
survival but often come at some cost to the individual. Although reinforcement of
adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary
persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is 
encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice
oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core,
where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory
synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens
receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic 
deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which
provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus
accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction.
Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus 
accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These
results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice
require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a

Core-mantle differentiation is the largest event experienced by a growing planet 
during its early history. Terrestrial core segregation imprinted the residual
mantle composition by scavenging siderophile (iron-loving) elements such as
tungsten, cobalt and sulphur. Cosmochemical constraints suggest that about 97% of
Earth's sulphur should at present reside in the core, which implies that the
residual silicate mantle should exhibit fractionated (34)S/(32)S ratios according
to the relevant metal-silicate partition coefficients, together with fractionated
siderophile element abundances. However, Earth's mantle has long been thought to 
be both homogeneous and chondritic for (34)S/(32)S, similar to Canyon Diablo
troilite, as it is for most siderophile elements. This belief was consistent with
a mantle sulphur budget dominated by late-accreted chondritic components. Here we
show that the mantle, as sampled by mid-ocean ridge basalts from the south
Atlantic ridge, displays heterogeneous (34)S/(32)S ratios, directly correlated to
the strontium and neodymium isotope ratios (87)Sr/(86)Sr and (143)Nd/(144)Nd.
These isotope trends are compatible with binary mixing between a low-(34)S/(32)S 
ambient mantle and a high-(34)S/(32)S recycled component that we infer to be
subducted sediments. The depleted end-member is characterized by a significantly 
negative δ(34)S of -1.28 ± 0.33‰ that cannot reach a chondritic value even when
surface sulphur (from continents, altered oceanic crust, sediments and oceans) is
added. Such a non-chondritic (34)S/(32)S ratio for the silicate Earth could be
accounted for by a core-mantle differentiation record in which the core has a
(34)S/(32)S ratio slightly higher than that of chondrites (δ(34)S = +0.07‰).
Despite evidence for late-veneer addition of siderophile elements (and therefore 
sulphur) after core formation, our results imply that the mantle sulphur budget
retains fingerprints of core-mantle differentiation.

The ability to design proteins with high affinity and selectivity for any given
small molecule is a rigorous test of our understanding of the physiochemical
principles that govern molecular recognition. Attempts to rationally design
ligand-binding proteins have met with little success, however, and the
computational design of protein-small-molecule interfaces remains an unsolved
problem. Current approaches for designing ligand-binding proteins for medical and
biotechnological uses rely on raising antibodies against a target antigen in
immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution of proteins
with an existing low affinity for the desired ligand, neither of which allows
complete control over the interactions involved in binding. Here we describe a
general computational method for designing pre-organized and shape complementary 
small-molecule-binding sites, and use it to generate protein binders to the
steroid digoxigenin (DIG). Of seventeen experimentally characterized designs, two
bind DIG; the model of the higher affinity binder has the most energetically
favourable and pre-organized interface in the design set. A comprehensive
binding-fitness landscape of this design, generated by library selections and
deep sequencing, was used to optimize its binding affinity to a picomolar level, 
and X-ray co-crystal structures of two variants show atomic-level agreement with 
the corresponding computational models. The optimized binder is selective for DIG
over the related steroids digitoxigenin, progesterone and β-oestradiol, and this 
steroid binding preference can be reprogrammed by manipulation of explicitly
designed hydrogen-bonding interactions. The computational design method presented
here should enable the development of a new generation of biosensors,
therapeutics and diagnostics.

Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and X-ray emission spectroscopy can be used
to probe the energy and dispersion of the elementary low-energy excitations that 
govern functionality in matter: vibronic, charge, spin and orbital excitations. A
key drawback of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering has been the need for high
photon densities to compensate for fluorescence yields of less than a per cent
for soft X-rays. Sample damage from the dominant non-radiative decays thus limits
the materials to which such techniques can be applied and the spectral resolution
that can be obtained. A means of improving the yield is therefore highly
desirable. Here we demonstrate stimulated X-ray emission for crystalline silicon 
at photon densities that are easily achievable with free-electron lasers. The
stimulated radiative decay of core excited species at the expense of
non-radiative processes reduces sample damage and permits narrow-bandwidth
detection in the directed beam of stimulated radiation. We deduce how stimulated 
X-ray emission can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude to provide, with
high yield and reduced sample damage, a superior probe for low-energy excitations
and their dispersion in matter. This is the first step to bringing nonlinear
X-ray physics in the condensed phase from theory to application.

In the ocean, the chemical forms of nitrogen that are readily available for
biological use (known collectively as 'fixed' nitrogen) fuel the global
phytoplankton productivity that exports carbon to the deep ocean. Accordingly,
variation in the oceanic fixed nitrogen reservoir has been proposed as a cause of
glacial-interglacial changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Marine 
nitrogen fixation, which produces most of the ocean's fixed nitrogen, is thought 
to be affected by multiple factors, including ocean temperature and the
availability of iron and phosphorus. Here we reconstruct changes in North
Atlantic nitrogen fixation over the past 160,000 years from the shell-bound
nitrogen isotope ratio ((15)N/(14)N) of planktonic foraminifera in Caribbean Sea 
sediments. The observed changes cannot be explained by reconstructed changes in
temperature, the supply of (iron-bearing) dust or water column denitrification.
We identify a strong, roughly 23,000-year cycle in nitrogen fixation and suggest 
that it is a response to orbitally driven changes in equatorial Atlantic
upwelling, which imports 'excess' phosphorus (phosphorus in stoichiometric excess
of fixed nitrogen) into the tropical North Atlantic surface. In addition, we find
that nitrogen fixation was reduced during glacial stages 6 and 4, when North
Atlantic Deep Water had shoaled to become glacial North Atlantic intermediate
water, which isolated the Atlantic thermocline from excess phosphorus-rich
mid-depth waters that today enter from the Southern Ocean. Although modern
studies have yielded diverse views of the controls on nitrogen fixation, our
palaeobiogeochemical data suggest that excess phosphorus is the master variable
in the North Atlantic Ocean and indicate that the variations in its supply over
the most recent glacial cycle were dominated by the response of regional ocean
circulation to the orbital cycles.

The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family is crucial for immune homeostasis, cell
death and inflammation. These cytokines are recognized by members of the TNF
receptor (TNFR) family of death receptors, including TNFR1 and TNFR2, and FAS and
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. Death receptor
signalling requires death-domain-mediated homotypic/heterotypic interactions
between the receptor and its downstream adaptors, including TNFR1-associated
death domain protein (TRADD) and FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD). Here
we discover that death domains in several proteins, including TRADD, FADD, RIPK1 
and TNFR1, were directly inactivated by NleB, an enteropathogenic Escherichia
coli (EPEC) type III secretion system effector known to inhibit host nuclear
factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling. NleB contained an unprecedented N-acetylglucosamine
(GlcNAc) transferase activity that specifically modified a conserved arginine in 
these death domains (Arg 235 in the TRADD death domain). NleB GlcNAcylation (the 
addition of GlcNAc onto a protein side chain) of death domains blocked
homotypic/heterotypic death domain interactions and assembly of the oligomeric
TNFR1 complex, thereby disrupting TNF signalling in EPEC-infected cells,
including NF-κB signalling, apoptosis and necroptosis. Type-III-delivered NleB
also blocked FAS ligand and TRAIL-induced cell death by preventing formation of a
FADD-mediated death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The arginine GlcNAc
transferase activity of NleB was required for bacterial colonization in the mouse
model of EPEC infection. The mechanism of action of NleB represents a new model
by which bacteria counteract host defences, and also a previously unappreciated
post-translational modification.

Tissue growth is the multifaceted outcome of a cell's intrinsic capabilities and 
its interactions with the surrounding environment. Decoding these complexities is
essential for understanding human development and tumorigenesis. Here we tackle
this problem by carrying out the first genome-wide RNA-interference-mediated
screens in mice. Focusing on skin development and oncogenic (Hras(G12V)-induced) 
hyperplasia, our screens uncover previously unknown as well as anticipated
regulators of embryonic epidermal growth. Among the top oncogenic screen hits are
Mllt6 and the Wnt effector β-catenin, which maintain Hras(G12V)-dependent
hyperproliferation. We also expose β-catenin as an unanticipated antagonist of
normal epidermal growth, functioning through Wnt-independent intercellular
adhesion. Finally, we validate functional significance in mouse and human
cancers, thereby establishing the feasibility of in vivo mammalian genome-wide
investigations to dissect tissue development and tumorigenesis. By documenting
some oncogenic growth regulators, we pave the way for future investigations of
other hits and raise promise for unearthing new targets for cancer therapies.

Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy
disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de
novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies:
infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced
the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo
mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations
in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation 
in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo 
mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two
patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with
epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the
probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P =
7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort
include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and
NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in
specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein
(P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.

proteins.

The internal organization of eukaryotic cells into functionally specialized,
membrane-delimited organelles of unique composition implies a need for active,
regulated lipid transport. Phosphatidylserine (PS), for example, is synthesized
in the endoplasmic reticulum and then preferentially associates--through
mechanisms not fully elucidated--with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.
Lipids can travel via transport vesicles. Alternatively, several protein families
known as lipid-transfer proteins (LTPs) can extract a variety of specific lipids 
from biological membranes and transport them, within a hydrophobic pocket,
through aqueous phases. Here we report the development of an integrated approach 
that combines protein fractionation and lipidomics to characterize the LTP-lipid 
complexes formed in vivo. We applied the procedure to 13 LTPs in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the six Sec14 homology (Sfh) proteins and the seven
oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) proteins. We found that Osh6 and Osh7 have an
unexpected specificity for PS. In vivo, they participate in PS homeostasis and
the transport of this lipid to the plasma membrane. The structure of Osh6 bound
to PS reveals unique features that are conserved among other metazoan
oxysterol-binding proteins (OSBPs) and are required for PS recognition. Our
findings represent the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, for the
non-vesicular transfer of PS from its site of biosynthesis (the endoplasmic
reticulum) to its site of biological activity (the plasma membrane). We describe 
a new subfamily of OSBPs, including human ORP5 and ORP10, that transfer PS and
propose new mechanisms of action for a protein family that is involved in several
human pathologies such as cancer, dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome.

KRAS and BRAF activating mutations drive tumorigenesis through constitutive
activation of the MAPK pathway. As these tumours represent an area of high unmet 
medical need, multiple allosteric MEK inhibitors, which inhibit MAPK signalling
in both genotypes, are being tested in clinical trials. Impressive single-agent
activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma has been observed; however, efficacy has been
far less robust in KRAS-mutant disease. Here we show that, owing to distinct
mechanisms regulating MEK activation in KRAS- versus BRAF-driven tumours,
different mechanisms of inhibition are required for optimal antitumour activity
in each genotype. Structural and functional analysis illustrates that MEK
inhibitors with superior efficacy in KRAS-driven tumours (GDC-0623 and G-573, the
former currently in phase I clinical trials) form a strong hydrogen-bond
interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback
phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. Conversely, potent inhibition of active,
phosphorylated MEK is required for strong inhibition of the MAPK pathway in
BRAF-mutant tumours, resulting in superior efficacy in this genotype with
GDC-0973 (also known as cobimetinib), a MEK inhibitor currently in phase III
clinical trials. Our study highlights that differences in the activation state of
MEK in KRAS-mutant tumours versus BRAF-mutant tumours can be exploited through
the design of inhibitors that uniquely target these distinct activation states of
MEK. These inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials to
determine whether improvements in therapeutic index within KRAS versus BRAF
preclinical models translate to improved clinical responses in patients.

Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) have a crucial role in the immune system by
preventing autoimmunity, limiting immunopathology, and maintaining immune
homeostasis. However, they also represent a major barrier to effective
anti-tumour immunity and sterilizing immunity to chronic viral infections. The
transcription factor Foxp3 has a major role in the development and programming of
Treg cells. The relative stability of Treg cells at inflammatory disease sites
has been a highly contentious subject. There is considerable interest in
identifying pathways that control the stability of Treg cells as many
immune-mediated diseases are characterized by either exacerbated or limited
Treg-cell function. Here we show that the immune-cell-expressed ligand
semaphorin-4a (Sema4a) and the Treg-cell-expressed receptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp1)
interact both in vitro, to potentiate Treg-cell function and survival, and in
vivo, at inflammatory sites. Using mice with a Treg-cell-restricted deletion of
Nrp1, we show that Nrp1 is dispensable for suppression of autoimmunity and
maintenance of immune homeostasis, but is required by Treg cells to limit
anti-tumour immune responses and to cure established inflammatory colitis. Sema4a
ligation of Nrp1 restrained Akt phosphorylation cellularly and at the immunologic
synapse by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), which increased nuclear
localization of the transcription factor Foxo3a. The Nrp1-induced transcriptome
promoted Treg-cell stability by enhancing quiescence and survival factors while
inhibiting programs that promote differentiation. Importantly, this
Nrp1-dependent molecular program is evident in intra-tumoral Treg cells. Our data
support a model in which Treg-cell stability can be subverted in certain
inflammatory sites, but is maintained by a Sema4a-Nrp1 axis, highlighting this
pathway as a potential therapeutic target that could limit Treg-cell-mediated
tumour-induced tolerance without inducing autoimmunity.

The germ-cell lineage ensures the continuity of life through the generation of
male and female gametes, which unite to form a totipotent zygote. We have
previously demonstrated that, by using cytokines, embryonic stem cells and
induced pluripotent stem cells can be induced into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs)
and then into primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells with the capacity for both
spermatogenesis and oogenesis, creating an opportunity for understanding and
regulating mammalian germ-cell development in both sexes in vitro. Here we show
that, without cytokines, simultaneous overexpression of three transcription
factors, Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14 and Tfap2c (also known as AP2γ),
directs EpiLCs, but not embryonic stem cells, swiftly and efficiently into a PGC 
state. Notably, Prdm14 alone, but not Blimp1 or Tfap2c, suffices for the
induction of the PGC state in EpiLCs. The transcription-factor-induced PGC state,
irrespective of the transcription factors used, reconstitutes key transcriptome
and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs, but bypasses a mesodermal program that
accompanies PGC or PGC-like-cell specification by cytokines including bone
morphogenetic protein 4. Notably, the transcription-factor-induced PGC-like cells
contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. Our findings provide a new
insight into the transcriptional logic for PGC specification, and create a
foundation for the transcription-factor-based reconstitution and regulation of
mammalian gametogenesis.

More than 130 million people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis C
virus (HCV) are at risk of developing severe liver disease. Antiviral treatments 
are only partially effective against HCV infection, and a vaccine is not
available. Development of more efficient therapies has been hampered by the lack 
of a small animal model. Building on the observation that CD81 and occludin
(OCLN) comprise the minimal set of human factors required to render mouse cells
permissive to HCV entry, we previously showed that transient expression of these 
two human genes is sufficient to allow viral uptake into fully immunocompetent
inbred mice. Here we demonstrate that transgenic mice stably expressing human
CD81 and OCLN also support HCV entry, but innate and adaptive immune responses
restrict HCV infection in vivo. Blunting antiviral immunity in genetically
humanized mice infected with HCV results in measurable viraemia over several
weeks. In mice lacking the essential cellular co-factor cyclophilin A (CypA), HCV
RNA replication is markedly diminished, providing genetic evidence that this
process is faithfully recapitulated. Using a cell-based fluorescent reporter
activated by the NS3-4A protease we visualize HCV infection in single hepatocytes
in vivo. Persistently infected mice produce de novo infectious particles, which
can be inhibited with directly acting antiviral drug treatment, thereby providing
evidence for the completion of the entire HCV life cycle in inbred mice. This
genetically humanized mouse model opens new opportunities to dissect genetically 
HCV infection in vivo and provides an important preclinical platform for testing 
and prioritizing drug candidates and may also have utility for evaluating vaccine
efficacy.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the shape of the genome importantly
influences transcription regulation. Pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic
stem cells were recently shown to organize their chromosomes into topological
domains that are largely invariant between cell types. Here we combine chromatin 
conformation capture technologies with chromatin factor binding data to
demonstrate that inactive chromatin is unusually disorganized in pluripotent
stem-cell nuclei. We show that gene promoters engage in contacts between
topological domains in a largely tissue-independent manner, whereas enhancers
have a more tissue-restricted interaction profile. Notably, genomic clusters of
pluripotency factor binding sites find each other very efficiently, in a manner
that is strictly pluripotent-stem-cell-specific, dependent on the presence of
Oct4 and Nanog protein and inducible after artificial recruitment of Nanog to a
selected chromosomal site. We conclude that pluripotent stem cells have a unique 
higher-order genome structure shaped by pluripotency factors. We speculate that
this interactome enhances the robustness of the pluripotent state.

Cognitive control is defined by a set of neural processes that allow us to
interact with our complex environment in a goal-directed manner. Humans regularly
challenge these control processes when attempting to simultaneously accomplish
multiple goals (multitasking), generating interference as the result of
fundamental information processing limitations. It is clear that multitasking
behaviour has become ubiquitous in today's technologically dense world, and
substantial evidence has accrued regarding multitasking difficulties and
cognitive control deficits in our ageing population. Here we show that
multitasking performance, as assessed with a custom-designed three-dimensional
video game (NeuroRacer), exhibits a linear age-related decline from 20 to 79
years of age. By playing an adaptive version of NeuroRacer in multitasking
training mode, older adults (60 to 85 years old) reduced multitasking costs
compared to both an active control group and a no-contact control group,
attaining levels beyond those achieved by untrained 20-year-old participants,
with gains persisting for 6 months. Furthermore, age-related deficits in neural
signatures of cognitive control, as measured with electroencephalography, were
remediated by multitasking training (enhanced midline frontal theta power and
frontal-posterior theta coherence). Critically, this training resulted in
performance benefits that extended to untrained cognitive control abilities
(enhanced sustained attention and working memory), with an increase in midline
frontal theta power predicting the training-induced boost in sustained attention 
and preservation of multitasking improvement 6 months later. These findings
highlight the robust plasticity of the prefrontal cognitive control system in the
ageing brain, and provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of how a
custom-designed video game can be used to assess cognitive abilities across the
lifespan, evaluate underlying neural mechanisms, and serve as a powerful tool for
cognitive enhancement.

Comment in
    Nature. 2013 Sep 5;501(7465):39-40.

Temperature data over the past five decades show faster warming of the global
land surface during the night than during the day. This asymmetric warming is
expected to affect carbon assimilation and consumption in plants, because
photosynthesis in most plants occurs during daytime and is more sensitive to the 
maximum daily temperature, Tmax, whereas plant respiration occurs throughout the 
day and is therefore influenced by both Tmax and the minimum daily temperature,
Tmin. Most studies of the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate warming, 
however, ignore this asymmetric forcing effect on vegetation growth and carbon
dioxide (CO2) fluxes. Here we analyse the interannual covariations of the
satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, an indicator of
vegetation greenness) with Tmax and Tmin over the Northern Hemisphere. After
removing the correlation between Tmax and Tmin, we find that the partial
correlation between Tmax and NDVI is positive in most wet and cool ecosystems
over boreal regions, but negative in dry temperate regions. In contrast, the
partial correlation between Tmin and NDVI is negative in boreal regions, and
exhibits a more complex behaviour in dry temperate regions. We detect similar
patterns in terrestrial net CO2 exchange maps obtained from a global atmospheric 
inversion model. Additional analysis of the long-term atmospheric CO2
concentration record of the station Point Barrow in Alaska suggests that the
peak-to-peak amplitude of CO2 increased by 23 ± 11% for a +1 °C anomaly in Tmax
from May to September over lands north of 51° N, but decreased by 28 ± 14% for a 
+1 °C anomaly in Tmin. These lines of evidence suggest that asymmetric diurnal
warming, a process that is currently not taken into account in many global carbon
cycle models, leads to a divergent response of Northern Hemisphere vegetation
growth and carbon sequestration to rising temperatures.

Catalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia by an iron model complex.

Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA.

The reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) is a requisite transformation for
life. Although it is widely appreciated that the iron-rich cofactors of
nitrogenase enzymes facilitate this transformation, how they do so remains poorly
understood. A central element of debate has been the exact site or sites of N2
coordination and reduction. In synthetic inorganic chemistry, an early emphasis
was placed on molybdenum because it was thought to be an essential element of
nitrogenases and because it had been established that well-defined molybdenum
model complexes could mediate the stoichiometric conversion of N2 to NH3 (ref.
9). This chemical transformation can be performed in a catalytic fashion by two
well-defined molecular systems that feature molybdenum centres. However, it is
now thought that iron is the only transition metal essential to all nitrogenases,
and recent biochemical and spectroscopic data have implicated iron instead of
molybdenum as the site of N2 binding in the FeMo-cofactor. Here we describe a
tris(phosphine)borane-supported iron complex that catalyses the reduction of N2
to NH3 under mild conditions, and in which more than 40 per cent of the proton
and reducing equivalents are delivered to N2. Our results indicate that a single 
iron site may be capable of stabilizing the various NxHy intermediates generated 
during catalytic NH3 formation. Geometric tunability at iron imparted by a
flexible iron-boron interaction in our model system seems to be important for
efficient catalysis. We propose that the interstitial carbon atom recently
assigned in the nitrogenase cofactor may have a similar role, perhaps by enabling
a single iron site to mediate the enzymatic catalysis through a flexible
iron-carbon interaction.

The theoretically proven security of quantum key distribution (QKD) could
revolutionize the way in which information exchange is protected in the future.
Several field tests of QKD have proven it to be a reliable technology for
cryptographic key exchange and have demonstrated nodal networks of point-to-point
links. However, until now no convincing answer has been given to the question of 
how to extend the scope of QKD beyond niche applications in dedicated high
security networks. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate the concept
of a 'quantum access network': based on simple and cost-effective
telecommunication technologies, the scheme can greatly expand the number of users
in quantum networks and therefore vastly broaden their appeal. We show that a
high-speed single-photon detector positioned at a network node can be shared
between up to 64 users for exchanging secret keys with the node, thereby
significantly reducing the hardware requirements for each user added to the
network. This point-to-multipoint architecture removes one of the main obstacles 
restricting the widespread application of QKD. It presents a viable method for
realizing multi-user QKD networks with efficient use of resources, and brings QKD
closer to becoming a widespread technology.

Self-propagation of pathogenic protein aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases.

For several decades scientists have speculated that the key to understanding
age-related neurodegenerative disorders may be found in the unusual biology of
the prion diseases. Recently, owing largely to the advent of new disease models, 
this hypothesis has gained experimental momentum. In a remarkable variety of
diseases, specific proteins have been found to misfold and aggregate into seeds
that structurally corrupt like proteins, causing them to aggregate and form
pathogenic assemblies ranging from small oligomers to large masses of amyloid.
Proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve as self-propagating agents for the
instigation and progression of disease. Alzheimer's disease and other cerebral
proteopathies seem to arise from the de novo misfolding and sustained corruption 
of endogenous proteins, whereas prion diseases can also be infectious in origin. 
However, the outcome in all cases is the functional compromise of the nervous
system, because the aggregated proteins gain a toxic function and/or lose their
normal function. As a unifying pathogenic principle, the prion paradigm suggests 
broadly relevant therapeutic directions for a large class of currently
intractable diseases.

Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax disease, is lethal owing to
the actions of two exotoxins: anthrax lethal toxin (LT) and oedema toxin (ET).
The key tissue targets responsible for the lethal effects of these toxins are
unknown. Here we generated cell-type-specific anthrax toxin receptor capillary
morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2)-null mice and cell-type-specific CMG2-expressing
mice and challenged them with the toxins. Our results show that lethality induced
by LT and ET occurs through damage to distinct cell types; whereas targeting
cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells is required for LT-induced
mortality, ET-induced lethality occurs mainly through its action in hepatocytes. 
Notably, and in contradiction to what has been previously postulated, targeting
of endothelial cells by either toxin does not seem to contribute significantly to
lethality. Our findings demonstrate that B. anthracis has evolved to use LT and
ET to induce host lethality by coordinately damaging two distinct vital systems.

Odd and even Kondo effects from emergent localization in quantum point contacts.

A quantum point contact (QPC) is a basic nanometre-scale electronic device: a
short and narrow transport channel between two electron reservoirs. In clean
channels, electron transport is ballistic and the conductance is then quantized
as a function of channel width with plateaux at integer multiples of 2e(2)/h
(where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant). This can be
understood in a picture where the electron states are propagating waves, without 
the need to account for electron-electron interactions. Quantized conductance
could thus be the signature of ultimate control over nanoscale electron
transport. However, even studies with the cleanest QPCs generically show
significant anomalies in the quantized conductance traces, and there is consensus
that these result from electron many-body effects. Despite extensive experimental
and theoretical studies, understanding these anomalies is an open problem. Here
we report that the many-body effects have their origin in one or more
spontaneously localized states that emerge from Friedel oscillations in the
electron charge density within the QPC channel. These localized states will have 
electron spins associated with them, and the Kondo effect--related to electron
transport through such localized electron spins--contributes to the formation of 
the many-body state. We present evidence for such localization, with Kondo
effects of odd or even character, directly reflecting the parity of the number of
localized states; the evidence is obtained from experiments with length-tunable
QPCs that show a periodic modulation of the many-body properties with Kondo
signatures that alternate between odd and even Kondo effects. Our results are of 
importance for assessing the role of QPCs in more complex hybrid devices and for 
proposals for spintronic and quantum information applications. In addition, our
results show that tunable QPCs offer a versatile platform for investigating
many-body effects in nanoscale systems, with the ability to probe such physics at
the level of a single site.

Quantum point contacts are narrow, one-dimensional constrictions usually
patterned in a two-dimensional electron system, for example by applying voltages 
to local gates. The linear conductance of a point contact, when measured as
function of its channel width, is quantized in units of GQ = 2e(2)/h, where e is 
the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. However, the conductance also has
an unexpected shoulder at ∼0.7GQ, known as the '0.7-anomaly', whose origin is
still subject to debate. Proposed theoretical explanations have invoked
spontaneous spin polarization, ferromagnetic spin coupling, the formation of a
quasi-bound state leading to the Kondo effect, Wigner crystallization and various
treatments of inelastic scattering. However, explicit calculations that fully
reproduce the various experimental observations in the regime of the 0.7-anomaly,
including the zero-bias peak that typically accompanies it, are still lacking.
Here we offer a detailed microscopic explanation for both the 0.7-anomaly and the
zero-bias peak: their common origin is a smeared van Hove singularity in the
local density of states at the bottom of the lowest one-dimensional subband of
the point contact, which causes an anomalous enhancement in the Hartree potential
barrier, the magnetic spin susceptibility and the inelastic scattering rate. We
find good qualitative agreement between theoretical calculations and experimental
results on the dependence of the conductance on gate voltage, magnetic field,
temperature, source-drain voltage (including the zero-bias peak) and interaction 
strength. We also clarify how the low-energy scale governing the 0.7-anomaly
depends on gate voltage and interactions. For low energies, we predict and
observe Fermi-liquid behaviour similar to that associated with the Kondo effect
in quantum dots. At high energies, however, the similarities between the
0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect end.

Topoisomerases are expressed throughout the developing and adult brain and are
mutated in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how
topoisomerases are mechanistically connected to ASD is unknown. Here we find that
topotecan, a topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor, dose-dependently reduces the
expression of extremely long genes in mouse and human neurons, including nearly
all genes that are longer than 200 kilobases. Expression of long genes is also
reduced after knockdown of Top1 or Top2b in neurons, highlighting that both
enzymes are required for full expression of long genes. By mapping RNA polymerase
II density genome-wide in neurons, we found that this length-dependent effect on 
gene expression was due to impaired transcription elongation. Interestingly, many
high-confidence ASD candidate genes are exceptionally long and were reduced in
expression after TOP1 inhibition. Our findings suggest that chemicals and genetic
mutations that impair topoisomerases could commonly contribute to ASD and other
neurodevelopmental disorders.

Nociceptor sensory neurons are specialized to detect potentially damaging
stimuli, protecting the organism by initiating the sensation of pain and
eliciting defensive behaviours. Bacterial infections produce pain by unknown
molecular mechanisms, although they are presumed to be secondary to immune
activation. Here we demonstrate that bacteria directly activate nociceptors, and 
that the immune response mediated through TLR2, MyD88, T cells, B cells, and
neutrophils and monocytes is not necessary for Staphylococcus aureus-induced pain
in mice. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice is correlated with live
bacterial load rather than tissue swelling or immune activation. Bacteria induce 
calcium flux and action potentials in nociceptor neurons, in part via bacterial
N-formylated peptides and the pore-forming toxin α-haemolysin, through distinct
mechanisms. Specific ablation of Nav1.8-lineage neurons, which include
nociceptors, abrogated pain during bacterial infection, but concurrently
increased local immune infiltration and lymphadenopathy of the draining lymph
node. Thus, bacterial pathogens produce pain by directly activating sensory
neurons that modulate inflammation, an unsuspected role for the nervous system in
host-pathogen interactions.

The RAG1/RAG2 endonuclease (RAG) initiates the V(D)J recombination reaction that 
assembles immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light (IgL) chain variable region exons 
from germline gene segments to generate primary antibody repertoires. IgH V(D)J
assembly occurs in progenitor (pro-) B cells followed by that of IgL in precursor
(pre-) B cells. Expression of IgH μ and IgL (Igκ or Igλ) chains generates IgM,
which is expressed on immature B cells as the B-cell antigen-binding receptor
(BCR). Rag expression can continue in immature B cells, allowing continued Igκ
V(D)J recombination that replaces the initial VκJκ exon with one that generates a
new specificity. This 'receptor editing' process, which can also lead to Igλ
V(D)J recombination and expression, provides a mechanism whereby antigen
encounter at the Rag-expressing immature B-cell stage helps shape pre-immune BCR 
repertoires. As the major site of postnatal B-cell development, the bone marrow
is the principal location of primary immunoglobulin repertoire diversification in
mice. Here we report that early B-cell development also occurs within the mouse
intestinal lamina propria (LP), where the associated V(D)J recombination/receptor
editing processes modulate primary LP immunoglobulin repertoires. At weanling age
in normally housed mice, the LP contains a population of Rag-expressing B-lineage
cells that harbour intermediates indicative of ongoing V(D)J recombination and
which contain cells with pro-B, pre-B and editing phenotypes. Consistent with
LP-specific receptor editing, Rag-expressing LP B-lineage cells have similar VH
repertoires, but significantly different Vκ repertoires, compared to those of
Rag2-expressing bone marrow counterparts. Moreover, colonization of germ-free
mice leads to an increased ratio of Igλ-expressing versus Igκ-expressing B cells 
specifically in the LP. We conclude that B-cell development occurs in the
intestinal mucosa, where it is regulated by extracellular signals from commensal 
microbes that influence gut immunoglobulin repertoires.

Newly synthesized proteins and lipids are transported across the Golgi complex
via different mechanisms whose respective roles are not completely clear. We
previously identified a non-vesicular intra-Golgi transport pathway for
glucosylceramide (GlcCer)--the common precursor of the different series of
glycosphingolipids-that is operated by the cytosolic GlcCer-transfer protein
FAPP2 (also known as PLEKHA8) (ref. 1). However, the molecular determinants of
the FAPP2-mediated transfer of GlcCer from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi
network, as well as the physiological relevance of maintaining two parallel
transport pathways of GlcCer--vesicular and non-vesicular--through the Golgi,
remain poorly defined. Here, using mouse and cell models, we clarify the
molecular mechanisms underlying the intra-Golgi vectorial transfer of GlcCer by
FAPP2 and show that GlcCer is channelled by vesicular and non-vesicular transport
to two topologically distinct glycosylation tracks in the Golgi cisternae and the
trans-Golgi network, respectively. Our results indicate that the transport
modality across the Golgi complex is a key determinant for the glycosylation
pattern of a cargo and establish a new paradigm for the branching of the
glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway.

Features that were once considered exclusive to modern birds, such as feathers
and a furcula, are now known to have first appeared in non-avian dinosaurs.
However, relatively little is known of the early evolutionary history of the
hyperinflated brain that distinguishes birds from other living reptiles and
provides the important neurological capablities required by flight. Here we use
high-resolution computed tomography to estimate and compare cranial volumes of
extant birds, the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica, and a number of
non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs that are phylogenetically close to the origins
of both Avialae and avian flight. Previous work established that avian cerebral
expansion began early in theropod history and that the cranial cavity of
Archaeopteryx was volumetrically intermediate between these early forms and
modern birds. Our new data indicate that the relative size of the cranial cavity 
of Archaeopteryx is reflective of a more generalized maniraptoran volumetric
signature and in several instances is actually smaller than that of other
non-avian dinosaurs. Thus, bird-like encephalization indices evolved multiple
times, supporting the conclusion that if Archaeopteryx had the neurological
capabilities required of flight, so did at least some other non-avian
maniraptorans. This is congruent with recent findings that avialans were not
unique among maniraptorans in their ability to fly in some form.

malignant cells from the neighbouring benign cells. However, reducing lethal
tissue injury caused by intensive chemoradiotherapy during treatment of
late-stage metastatic cancers remains a key clinical challenge. Here we tested
whether the induction of adult stem cells could repair chemoradiation-induced
tissue injury and prolong overall survival in mice. We found that intestinal stem
cells (ISCs) expressed Slit2 and its single-span transmembrane cell-surface
receptor roundabout 1 (Robo1). Partial genetic deletion of Robo1 decreased ISC
numbers and caused villus hypotrophy, whereas a Slit2 transgene increased ISC
numbers and triggered villus hypertrophy. During lethal dosages of
chemoradiation, administering a short pulse of R-spondin 1 (Rspo1; a Wnt agonist)
plus Slit2 reduced ISC loss, mitigated gut impairment and protected animals from 
death, without concomitantly decreasing tumour sensitivity to chemotherapy.
Therefore Rspo1 and Slit2 may act as therapeutic adjuvants to enhance host
tolerance to aggressive chemoradiotherapy for eradicating metastatic cancers.

Prion infections cause lethal neurodegeneration. This process requires the
cellular prion protein (PrP(C); ref. 1), which contains a globular domain hinged 
to a long amino-proximal flexible tail. Here we describe rapid neurotoxicity in
mice and cerebellar organotypic cultured slices exposed to ligands targeting the 
α1 and α3 helices of the PrP(C) globular domain. Ligands included seven distinct 
monoclonal antibodies, monovalent Fab1 fragments and recombinant single-chain
variable fragment miniantibodies. Similar to prion infections, the toxicity of
globular domain ligands required neuronal PrP(C), was exacerbated by PrP(C)
overexpression, was associated with calpain activation and was antagonized by
calpain inhibitors. Neurodegeneration was accompanied by a burst of reactive
oxygen species, and was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, genetic ablation
of the superoxide-producing enzyme NOX2 (also known as CYBB) protected mice from 
globular domain ligand toxicity. We also found that neurotoxicity was prevented
by deletions of the octapeptide repeats within the flexible tail. These deletions
did not appreciably compromise globular domain antibody binding, suggesting that 
the flexible tail is required to transmit toxic signals that originate from the
globular domain and trigger oxidative stress and calpain activation. Supporting
this view, various octapeptide ligands were not only innocuous to both cerebellar
organotypic cultured slices and mice, but also prevented the toxicity of globular
domain ligands while not interfering with their binding. We conclude that PrP(C) 
consists of two functionally distinct modules, with the globular domain and the
flexible tail exerting regulatory and executive functions, respectively.
Octapeptide ligands also prolonged the life of mice expressing the toxic PrP(C)
mutant, PrP(Δ94-134), indicating that the flexible tail mediates toxicity in two 
distinct PrP(C)-related conditions. Flexible tail-mediated toxicity may
conceivably play a role in further prion pathologies, such as familial
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans bearing supernumerary octapeptides.

Application of a specific stimulus opens the intracellular gate of a K(+) channel
(activation), yielding a transient period of ion conduction until the selectivity
filter spontaneously undergoes a conformational change towards a non-conductive
state (inactivation). Removal of the stimulus closes the gate and allows the
selectivity filter to interconvert back to its conductive conformation
(recovery). Given that the structural differences between the conductive and
inactivated filter are very small, it is unclear why the recovery process can
take up to several seconds. The bacterial K(+) channel KcsA from Streptomyces
lividans can be used to help elucidate questions about channel inactivation and
recovery at the atomic level. Although KcsA contains only a pore domain, without 
voltage-sensing machinery, it has the structural elements necessary for ion
conduction, activation and inactivation. Here we reveal, by means of a series of 
long molecular dynamics simulations, how the selectivity filter is sterically
locked in the inactive conformation by buried water molecules bound behind the
selectivity filter. Potential of mean force calculations show how the recovery
process is affected by the buried water molecules and the rebinding of an
external K(+) ion. A kinetic model deduced from the simulations shows how
releasing the buried water molecules can stretch the timescale of recovery to
seconds. This leads to the prediction that reducing the occupancy of the buried
water molecules by imposing a high osmotic stress should accelerate the rate of
recovery, which was verified experimentally by measuring the recovery rate in the
presence of a 2-molar sucrose concentration.

Complex gene-environment interactions are considered important in the development
of obesity. The composition of the gut microbiota can determine the efficacy of
energy harvest from food and changes in dietary composition have been associated 
with changes in the composition of gut microbial populations. The capacity to
explore microbiota composition was markedly improved by the development of
metagenomic approaches, which have already allowed production of the first human 
gut microbial gene catalogue and stratifying individuals by their gut genomic
profile into different enterotypes, but the analyses were carried out mainly in
non-intervention settings. To investigate the temporal relationships between food
intake, gut microbiota and metabolic and inflammatory phenotypes, we conducted
diet-induced weight-loss and weight-stabilization interventions in a study sample
of 38 obese and 11 overweight individuals. Here we report that individuals with
reduced microbial gene richness (40%) present more pronounced dys-metabolism and 
low-grade inflammation, as observed concomitantly in the accompanying paper.
Dietary intervention improves low gene richness and clinical phenotypes, but
seems to be less efficient for inflammation variables in individuals with lower
gene richness. Low gene richness may therefore have predictive potential for the 
efficacy of intervention.

Rapid, climate-driven changes in outlet glaciers on the Pacific coast of East
Antarctica.

Observations of ocean-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland and West
Antarctica indicate that their contribution to sea level is accelerating as a
result of increased velocity, thinning and retreat. Thinning has also been
reported along the margin of the much larger East Antarctic ice sheet, but
whether glaciers are advancing or retreating there is largely unknown, and there 
has been no attempt to place such changes in the context of localized mass loss
or climatic or oceanic forcing. Here we present multidecadal trends in the
terminus position of 175 ocean-terminating outlet glaciers along 5,400 kilometres
of the margin of the East Antarctic ice sheet, and reveal widespread and
synchronous changes. Despite large fluctuations between glaciers--linked to their
size--three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974
to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from
2000 to 2010. These trends were most pronounced along the warmer western South
Pacific coast, whereas glaciers along the cooler Ross Sea coast experienced no
significant changes. We find that glacier change along the Pacific coast is
consistent with a rapid and coherent response to air temperature and sea-ice
trends, linked through the dominant mode of atmospheric variability (the Southern
Annular Mode). We conclude that parts of the world's largest ice sheet may be
more vulnerable to external forcing than recognized previously.

Coccolithophores are marine algae that use carbon for calcification and
photosynthesis. The long-term adaptation of these and other marine algae to
decreasing carbon dioxide levels during the Cenozoic era has resulted in modern
algae capable of actively enhancing carbon dioxide at the site of photosynthesis.
This enhancement occurs through the transport of dissolved bicarbonate (HCO3(-)) 
and with the help of enzymes whose expression can be modulated by variable
aqueous carbon dioxide concentration, [CO2], in laboratory cultures.
Coccolithophores preserve the geological history of this adaptation because the
stable carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of their calcite plates
(coccoliths), which are preserved in the fossil record, are sensitive to active
carbon uptake and transport by the cell. Here we use a model of cellular carbon
fluxes and show that at low [CO2] the increased demand for HCO3(-) at the site of
photosynthesis results in a diminished allocation of HCO3(-) to calcification,
which is most pronounced in larger cells. This results in a large divergence
between the carbon isotopic compositions of small versus large coccoliths only at
low [CO2]. Our evaluation of the oxygen and carbon isotope record of
size-separated fossil coccoliths reveals that this isotopic divergence first
arose during the late Miocene to the earliest Pliocene epoch (about 7-5 million
years ago). We interpret this to be a threshold response of the cells' carbon
acquisition strategies to decreasing [CO2]. The documented coccolithophore
response is synchronous with a global shift in terrestrial vegetation
distribution between 8 and 5 Myr ago, which has been interpreted by some studies 
as a floral response to decreasing partial pressures of carbon dioxide () in the 
atmosphere. We infer a global decrease in carbon dioxide levels for this time
interval that has not yet been identified in the sparse proxy record but is
synchronous with global cooling and progressive glaciations.

Artificial spin ice is a class of lithographically created arrays of interacting 
ferromagnetic nanometre-scale islands. It was introduced to investigate many-body
phenomena related to frustration and disorder in a material that could be
tailored to precise specifications and imaged directly. Because of the large
magnetic energy scales of these nanoscale islands, it has so far been impossible 
to thermally anneal artificial spin ice into desired thermodynamic ensembles;
nearly all studies of artificial spin ice have either treated it as a granular
material activated by alternating fields or focused on the as-grown state of the 
arrays. This limitation has prevented experimental investigation of novel phases 
that can emerge from the nominal ground states of frustrated lattices. For
example, artificial kagome spin ice, in which the islands are arranged on the
edges of a hexagonal net, is predicted to support states with monopolar charge
order at entropies below that of the previously observed pseudo-ice manifold.
Here we demonstrate a method for thermalizing artificial spin ices with square
and kagome lattices by heating above the Curie temperature of the constituent
material. In this manner, artificial square spin ice achieves unprecedented
thermal ordering of the moments. In artificial kagome spin ice, we observe
incipient crystallization of the magnetic charges embedded in pseudo-ice, with
crystallites of magnetic charges whose size can be controlled by tuning the
lattice constant. We find excellent agreement between experimental data and Monte
Carlo simulations of emergent charge-charge interactions.

A rigid and weathered ice shell on Titan.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has a global
subsurface ocean beneath an outer ice shell 50 to 200 kilometres thick. If
convection is occurring, the rigid portion of the shell is expected to be thin;
similarly, a weak, isostatically compensated shell has been proposed to explain
the observed topography. Here we report a strong inverse correlation between
gravity and topography at long wavelengths that are not dominated by tides and
rotation. We argue that negative gravity anomalies (mass deficits) produced by
crustal thickening at the base of the ice shell overwhelm positive gravity
anomalies (mass excesses) produced by the small surface topography, giving rise
to this inverse correlation. We show that this situation requires a substantially
rigid ice shell with an elastic thickness exceeding 40 kilometres, and hundreds
of metres of surface erosion and deposition, consistent with recent estimates
from local features. Our results are therefore not compatible with a geologically
active, low-rigidity ice shell. After extrapolating to wavelengths that are
controlled by tides and rotation, we suggest that Titan's moment of inertia may
be even higher (that is, Titan may be even less centrally condensed) than is
currently thought.

We are facing a global metabolic health crisis provoked by an obesity epidemic.
Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 
non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals
that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness.
They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different
proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23% of the population)
are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and
dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with
high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower
bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial
species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low
bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our
classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of
individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of
progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.

Although recent studies have indicated roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in
physiological aspects of cell-type determination and tissue homeostasis, their
potential involvement in regulated gene transcription programs remains rather
poorly understood. The androgen receptor regulates a large repertoire of genes
central to the identity and behaviour of prostate cancer cells, and functions in 
a ligand-independent fashion in many prostate cancers when they become hormone
refractory after initial androgen deprivation therapy. Here we report that two
lncRNAs highly overexpressed in aggressive prostate cancer, PRNCR1 (also known as
PCAT8) and PCGEM1, bind successively to the androgen receptor and strongly
enhance both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent androgen-receptor-mediated
gene activation programs and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Binding of
PRNCR1 to the carboxy-terminally acetylated androgen receptor on enhancers and
its association with DOT1L appear to be required for recruitment of the second
lncRNA, PCGEM1, to the androgen receptor amino terminus that is methylated by
DOT1L. Unexpectedly, recognition of specific protein marks by PCGEM1-recruited
pygopus 2 PHD domain enhances selective looping of androgen-receptor-bound
enhancers to target gene promoters in these cells. In 'resistant' prostate cancer
cells, these overexpressed lncRNAs can interact with, and are required for, the
robust activation of both truncated and full-length androgen receptor, causing
ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor transcriptional program
and cell proliferation. Conditionally expressed short hairpin RNA targeting these
lncRNAs in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines strongly suppressed
tumour xenograft growth in vivo. Together, these results indicate that these
overexpressed lncRNAs can potentially serve as a required component of
castration-resistance in prostatic tumours.

Behavioural responses to temperature are critical for survival, and animals from 
insects to humans show strong preferences for specific temperatures. Preferred
temperature selection promotes avoidance of adverse thermal environments in the
short term and maintenance of optimal body temperatures over the long term, but
its molecular and cellular basis is largely unknown. Recent studies have
generated conflicting views of thermal preference in Drosophila, attributing
importance to either internal or peripheral warmth sensors. Here we reconcile
these views by showing that thermal preference is not a singular response, but
involves multiple systems relevant in different contexts. We found previously
that the transient receptor potential channel TRPA1 acts internally to control
the slowly developing preference response of flies exposed to a shallow thermal
gradient. We now find that the rapid response of flies exposed to a steep warmth 
gradient does not require TRPA1; rather, the gustatory receptor GR28B(D) drives
this behaviour through peripheral thermosensors. Gustatory receptors are a large 
gene family, widely studied in insect gustation and olfaction, and are implicated
in host-seeking by insect disease vectors, but have not previously been
implicated in thermosensation. At the molecular level, GR28B(D) misexpression
confers thermosensitivity upon diverse cell types, suggesting that it is a warmth
sensor. These data reveal a new type of thermosensory molecule and uncover a
functional distinction between peripheral and internal warmth sensors in this
tiny ectotherm reminiscent of thermoregulatory systems in larger, endothermic
animals. The use of multiple, distinct molecules to respond to a given
temperature, as observed here, may facilitate independent tuning of an animal's
distinct thermosensory responses.

Predictions about future rewarding events have a powerful influence on behaviour.
The phasic spike activity of dopamine-containing neurons, and corresponding
dopamine transients in the striatum, are thought to underlie these predictions,
encoding positive and negative reward prediction errors. However, many behaviours
are directed towards distant goals, for which transient signals may fail to
provide sustained drive. Here we report an extended mode of reward-predictive
dopamine signalling in the striatum that emerged as rats moved towards distant
goals. These dopamine signals, which were detected with fast-scan cyclic
voltammetry (FSCV), gradually increased or--in rare instances--decreased as the
animals navigated mazes to reach remote rewards, rather than having phasic or
steady tonic profiles. These dopamine increases (ramps) scaled flexibly with both
the distance and size of the rewards. During learning, these dopamine signals
showed spatial preferences for goals in different locations and readily changed
in magnitude to reflect changing values of the distant rewards. Such prolonged
dopamine signalling could provide sustained motivational drive, a control
mechanism that may be important for normal behaviour and that can be impaired in 
a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Short-duration γ-ray bursts are intense flashes of cosmic γ-rays, lasting less
than about two seconds, whose origin is unclear. The favoured hypothesis is that 
they are produced by a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact
stellar objects (specifically two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black
hole). This is supported by indirect evidence such as the properties of their
host galaxies, but unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking.
Mergers of this kind are also expected to create significant quantities of
neutron-rich radioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient,
known as a 'kilonova', in the days following the burst. Indeed, it is speculated 
that this mechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in
the Universe. Recent calculations suggest that much of the kilonova energy should
appear in the near-infrared spectral range, because of the high optical opacity
created by these heavy r-process elements. Here we report optical and
near-infrared observations that provide strong evidence for such an event
accompanying the short-duration γ-ray burst GRB 130603B. If this, the simplest
interpretation of the data, is correct, then it confirms that compact-object
mergers are the progenitors of short-duration γ-ray bursts and the sites of
significant production of r-process elements. It also suggests that kilonovae
offer an alternative, unbeamed electromagnetic signature of the most promising
sources for direct detection of gravitational waves.

Chromosome duplication normally initiates through the assembly of replication
fork complexes at defined origins. DNA synthesis by any one fork is thought to
cease when it meets another travelling in the opposite direction, at which stage 
the replication machinery may simply dissociate before the nascent strands are
finally ligated. But what actually happens is not clear. Here we present evidence
consistent with the idea that every fork collision has the potential to threaten 
genomic integrity. In Escherichia coli this threat is kept at bay by RecG DNA
translocase and by single-strand DNA exonucleases. Without RecG, replication
initiates where forks meet through a replisome assembly mechanism normally
associated with fork repair, replication restart and recombination, establishing 
new forks with the potential to sustain cell growth and division without an
active origin. This potential is realized when roadblocks to fork progression are
reduced or eliminated. It relies on the chromosome being circular, reinforcing
the idea that replication initiation is triggered repeatedly by fork collision.
The results reported raise the question of whether replication fork collisions
have pathogenic potential for organisms that exploit several origins to replicate
each chromosome.

Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is critical for controlling the flux of
methane from anoxic environments. AOM coupled to iron, manganese and sulphate
reduction have been demonstrated in consortia containing anaerobic methanotrophic
(ANME) archaea. More recently it has been shown that the bacterium Candidatus
'Methylomirabilis oxyfera' can couple AOM to nitrite reduction through an
intra-aerobic methane oxidation pathway. Bioreactors capable of AOM coupled to
denitrification have resulted in the enrichment of 'M. oxyfera' and a novel ANME 
lineage, ANME-2d. However, as 'M. oxyfera' can independently couple AOM to
denitrification, the role of ANME-2d in the process is unresolved. Here, a
bioreactor fed with nitrate, ammonium and methane was dominated by a single
ANME-2d population performing nitrate-driven AOM. Metagenomic, single-cell
genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses combined with bioreactor performance and 
(13)C- and (15)N-labelling experiments show that ANME-2d is capable of
independent AOM through reverse methanogenesis using nitrate as the terminal
electron acceptor. Comparative analyses reveal that the genes for nitrate
reduction were transferred laterally from a bacterial donor, suggesting selection
for this novel process within ANME-2d. Nitrite produced by ANME-2d is reduced to 
dinitrogen gas through a syntrophic relationship with an anaerobic
ammonium-oxidizing bacterium, effectively outcompeting 'M. oxyfera' in the
system. We propose the name Candidatus 'Methanoperedens nitroreducens' for the
ANME-2d population and the family Candidatus 'Methanoperedenaceae' for the
ANME-2d lineage. We predict that 'M. nitroreducens' and other members of the
'Methanoperedenaceae' have an important role in linking the global carbon and
nitrogen cycles in anoxic environments.

Mammalian pre-implantation development is a complex process involving dramatic
changes in the transcriptional architecture. We report here a comprehensive
analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse 
embryos, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on single-nucleotide variants in
human blastomere messenger RNAs and paternal-specific single-nucleotide
polymorphisms, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns
for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25 to 53%). By
weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we find that each developmental
stage can be delineated concisely by a small number of functional modules of
co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional
changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation and metabolism,
acting in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons 
with mouse pre-implantation embryos reveal that the majority of human
stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are notably preserved, but developmental
specificity and timing differ between human and mouse. Furthermore, we identify
conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes
represent novel candidates that are likely to be key in driving mammalian
pre-implantation development. Together, the results provide a valuable resource
to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms underlying progressive development of early
mammalian embryos.

Co-development of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems is a recent
evolutionary adaption to terrestrial life that couples cardiac output with the
gas exchange function of the lung. Here we show that the murine pulmonary
vasculature develops even in the absence of lung development. We have identified 
a population of multipotent cardiopulmonary mesoderm progenitors (CPPs) within
the posterior pole of the heart that are marked by the expression of Wnt2, Gli1
and Isl1. We show that CPPs arise from cardiac progenitors before lung
development. Lineage tracing and clonal analysis demonstrates that CPPs generate 
the mesoderm lineages within the cardiac inflow tract and lung including
cardiomyocytes, pulmonary vascular and airway smooth muscle, proximal vascular
endothelium, and pericyte-like cells. CPPs are regulated by hedgehog expression
from the foregut endoderm, which is required for connection of the pulmonary
vasculature to the heart. Together, these studies identify a novel population of 
multipotent cardiopulmonary progenitors that coordinates heart and lung
co-development that is required for adaptation to terrestrial existence.

The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and
hence how reproducible evolution will be. This is central to understanding the
spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the
response of pathogens to immune selection, and the dynamics of cancer
progression. In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial
mutations are found repeatedly, but are often accompanied by other mutations with
no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to
examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 
40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for
1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations
arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational 'cohorts'.
Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each
other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence
evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and
interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and
the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours
parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations.

Despite the large size of the Xenopus laevis egg (approximately 1.2 mm diameter),
a fertilized egg rapidly proceeds through mitosis in a spatially coordinated
fashion. Mitosis is initiated by a bistable system of regulatory proteins centred
on Cdk1 (refs 1, 2), raising the possibility that this spatial coordination could
be achieved through trigger waves of Cdk1 activity. Using an extract system that 
performs cell cycles in vitro, here we show that mitosis does spread through
Xenopus cytoplasm via trigger waves, propagating at a linear speed of
approximately 60 µm min(-1). Perturbing the feedback loops that give rise to the 
bistability of Cdk1 changes the speed and dynamics of the waves. Time-lapse
imaging of intact eggs argues that trigger waves of Cdk1 activation are
responsible for surface contraction waves, ripples in the cell cortex that
precede cytokinesis. These findings indicate that Cdk1 trigger waves help ensure 
the spatiotemporal coordination of mitosis in large eggs. Trigger waves may be an
important general mechanism for coordinating biochemical events over large
distances.

Mutualistic networks are formed when the interactions between two classes of
species are mutually beneficial. They are important examples of cooperation
shaped by evolution. Mutualism between animals and plants has a key role in the
organization of ecological communities. Such networks in ecology have generally
evolved a nested architecture independent of species composition and latitude;
specialist species, with only few mutualistic links, tend to interact with a
proper subset of the many mutualistic partners of any of the generalist species. 
Despite sustained efforts to explain observed network structure on the basis of
community-level stability or persistence, such correlative studies have reached
minimal consensus. Here we show that nested interaction networks could emerge as 
a consequence of an optimization principle aimed at maximizing the species
abundance in mutualistic communities. Using analytical and numerical approaches, 
we show that because of the mutualistic interactions, an increase in abundance of
a given species results in a corresponding increase in the total number of
individuals in the community, and also an increase in the nestedness of the
interaction matrix. Indeed, the species abundances and the nestedness of the
interaction matrix are correlated by a factor that depends on the strength of the
mutualistic interactions. Nestedness and the observed spontaneous emergence of
generalist and specialist species occur for several dynamical implementations of 
the variational principle under stationary conditions. Optimized networks,
although remaining stable, tend to be less resilient than their counterparts with
randomly assigned interactions. In particular, we show analytically that the
abundance of the rarest species is linked directly to the resilience of the
community. Our work provides a unifying framework for studying the emergent
structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks.

First-order phase transitions in solids are notoriously challenging to study. The
combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion and
flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain structure,
hysteresis and cracking. The situation is worse near a triple point, where more
than two phases are involved. The well-known metal-insulator transition in
vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical and electrical
switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is one of the
simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties posed by the
first-order nature of the metal-insulator transition as well as the involvement
of at least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy
about its nature. Here we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a
purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this
prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our
results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic phase 
and two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, Ttr = Tc, which we
determine to be 65.0 ± 0.1 °C. The findings have profound implications for the
mechanism of the metal-insulator transition in VO2, but they also demonstrate the
importance of this approach for mastering phase transitions in many other
strongly correlated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.

Surface gravity is a basic stellar property, but it is difficult to measure
accurately, with typical uncertainties of 25 to 50 per cent if measured
spectroscopically and 90 to 150 per cent if measured photometrically.
Asteroseismology measures gravity with an uncertainty of about 2 per cent but is 
restricted to relatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants.
The availability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for more
than 150,000 stars provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variations 
can be used to determine surface gravities. The Fourier power of granulation on a
star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity: if brightness
variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation, then such variations
should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival
data that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and root
mean squared brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hours for
stars with temperatures of 4,500 to 6,750 kelvin, log surface gravities of 2.5 to
4.5 (cgs units) and overall brightness variations of less than three parts per
thousand. A straightforward observation of optical brightness variations
therefore allows a determination of the surface gravity with a precision of
better than 25 per cent for inactive Sun-like stars at main-sequence to giant
stages of evolution.

Wounded leaves communicate their damage status to one another through a poorly
understood process of long-distance signalling. This stimulates the distal
production of jasmonates, potent regulators of defence responses. Using
non-invasive electrodes we mapped surface potential changes in Arabidopsis
thaliana after wounding leaf eight and found that membrane depolarizations
correlated with jasmonate signalling domains in undamaged leaves. Furthermore,
current injection elicited jasmonoyl-isoleucine accumulation, resulting in a
transcriptome enriched in RNAs encoding key jasmonate signalling regulators. From
among 34 screened membrane protein mutant lines, mutations in several clade 3
GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE genes (GLRs 3.2, 3.3 and 3.6) attenuated wound-induced
surface potential changes. Jasmonate-response gene expression in leaves distal to
wounds was reduced in a glr3.3 glr3.6 double mutant. This work provides a genetic
basis for investigating mechanisms of long-distance wound signalling in plants
and indicates that plant genes related to those important for synaptic activity
in animals function in organ-to-organ wound signalling.

All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the
biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of
somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational
processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from
7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are
present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family
of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class.
Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis,
known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic 
origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation
localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types.
The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the
development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer
aetiology, prevention and therapy.

The cause of warming in the Southern Hemisphere during the most recent
deglaciation remains a matter of debate. Hypotheses for a Northern Hemisphere
trigger, through oceanic redistributions of heat, are based in part on the abrupt
onset of warming seen in East Antarctic ice cores and dated to 18,000 years ago, 
which is several thousand years after high-latitude Northern Hemisphere summer
insolation intensity began increasing from its minimum, approximately 24,000
years ago. An alternative explanation is that local solar insolation changes
cause the Southern Hemisphere to warm independently. Here we present results from
a new, annually resolved ice-core record from West Antarctica that reconciles
these two views. The records show that 18,000 years ago snow accumulation in West
Antarctica began increasing, coincident with increasing carbon dioxide
concentrations, warming in East Antarctica and cooling in the Northern Hemisphere
associated with an abrupt decrease in Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation. However, significant warming in West Antarctica began at least 2,000
years earlier. Circum-Antarctic sea-ice decline, driven by increasing local
insolation, is the likely cause of this warming. The marine-influenced West
Antarctic records suggest a more active role for the Southern Ocean in the onset 
of deglaciation than is inferred from ice cores in the East Antarctic interior,
which are largely isolated from sea-ice changes.

The role of spin in the kinetic control of recombination in organic
photovoltaics.

In biological complexes, cascade structures promote the spatial separation of
photogenerated electrons and holes, preventing their recombination. In contrast, 
the photogenerated excitons in organic photovoltaic cells are dissociated at a
single donor-acceptor heterojunction formed within a de-mixed blend of the donor 
and acceptor semiconductors. The nanoscale morphology and high charge densities
give a high rate of electron-hole encounters, which should in principle result in
the formation of spin-triplet excitons, as in organic light-emitting diodes.
Although organic photovoltaic cells would have poor quantum efficiencies if every
encounter led to recombination, state-of-the-art examples nevertheless
demonstrate near-unity quantum efficiency. Here we show that this suppression of 
recombination arises through the interplay between spin, energetics and
delocalization of electronic excitations in organic semiconductors. We use
time-resolved spectroscopy to study a series of model high-efficiency
polymer-fullerene systems in which the lowest-energy molecular triplet exciton
(T1) for the polymer is lower in energy than the intermolecular charge transfer
state. We observe the formation of T1 states following bimolecular recombination,
indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated electrons and holes generate
charge transfer states with both spin-singlet ((1)CT) and spin-triplet ((3)CT)
characters. We show that the formation of triplet excitons can be the main loss
mechanism in organic photovoltaic cells. But we also find that, even when
energetically favoured, the relaxation of (3)CT states to T1 states can be
strongly suppressed by wavefunction delocalization, allowing for the dissociation
of (3)CT states back to free charges, thereby reducing recombination and
enhancing device performance. Our results point towards new design rules both for
photoconversion systems, enabling the suppression of electron-hole recombination,
and for organic light-emitting diodes, avoiding the formation of triplet excitons
and enhancing fluorescence efficiency.

DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is
essential for normal development. Most cell types, except germ cells and
pre-implantation embryos, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns,
with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances, we still have 
a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic
regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite
sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe
dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental
context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic
CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and
transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key
lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with
cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The 
results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite
sequencing, as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided
little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further
the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify
representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation
dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation
state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated
regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point
to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the
most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative
regulatory elements.

Neuromodulatory control by oxytocin is essential to a wide range of social,
parental and stress-related behaviours. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are
associated with deficiencies in oxytocin levels and with genetic alterations of
the oxytocin receptor (OXTR). Thirty years ago, Mühlethaler et al. found that
oxytocin increases the firing of inhibitory hippocampal neurons, but it remains
unclear how elevated inhibition could account for the ability of oxytocin to
improve information processing in the brain. Here we describe in mammalian
hippocampus a simple yet powerful mechanism by which oxytocin enhances cortical
information transfer while simultaneously lowering background activity, thus
greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Increased fast-spiking interneuron
activity not only suppresses spontaneous pyramidal cell firing, but also enhances
the fidelity of spike transmission and sharpens spike timing. Use-dependent
depression at the fast-spiking interneuron-pyramidal cell synapse is both
necessary and sufficient for the enhanced spike throughput. We show the
generality of this novel circuit mechanism by activation of fast-spiking
interneurons with cholecystokinin or channelrhodopsin-2. This provides insight
into how a diffusely delivered neuromodulator can improve the performance of
neural circuitry that requires synapse specificity and millisecond precision.

The dynamic nature of gene expression enables cellular programming, homeostasis
and environmental adaptation in living systems. Dissection of causal gene
functions in cellular and organismal processes therefore necessitates approaches 
that enable spatially and temporally precise modulation of gene expression.
Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived light-sensitive proteins have 
been engineered as optogenetic actuators, enabling high-precision spatiotemporal 
control of many cellular functions. However, versatile and robust technologies
that enable optical modulation of transcription in the mammalian endogenous
genome remain elusive. Here we describe the development of light-inducible
transcriptional effectors (LITEs), an optogenetic two-hybrid system integrating
the customizable TALE DNA-binding domain with the light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 
protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. LITEs do not 
require additional exogenous chemical cofactors, are easily customized to target 
many endogenous genomic loci, and can be activated within minutes with
reversibility. LITEs can be packaged into viral vectors and genetically targeted 
to probe specific cell populations. We have applied this system in primary mouse 
neurons, as well as in the brain of freely behaving mice in vivo to mediate
reversible modulation of mammalian endogenous gene expression as well as targeted
epigenetic chromatin modifications. The LITE system establishes a novel mode of
optogenetic control of endogenous cellular processes and enables direct testing
of the causal roles of genetic and epigenetic regulation in normal biological
processes and disease states.

Loss of sexual reproduction is considered an evolutionary dead end for metazoans,
but bdelloid rotifers challenge this view as they appear to have persisted
asexually for millions of years. Neither male sex organs nor meiosis have ever
been observed in these microscopic animals: oocytes are formed through mitotic
divisions, with no reduction of chromosome number and no indication of chromosome
pairing. However, current evidence does not exclude that they may engage in sex
on rare, cryptic occasions. Here we report the genome of a bdelloid rotifer,
Adineta vaga (Davis, 1873), and show that its structure is incompatible with
conventional meiosis. At gene scale, the genome of A. vaga is tetraploid and
comprises both anciently duplicated segments and less divergent allelic regions. 
However, in contrast to sexual species, the allelic regions are rearranged and
sometimes even found on the same chromosome. Such structure does not allow
meiotic pairing; instead, we find abundant evidence of gene conversion, which may
limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of meiosis. Gene
families involved in resistance to oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and defence
against transposons are significantly expanded, which may explain why
transposable elements cover only 3% of the assembled sequence. Furthermore, 8% of
the genes are likely to be of non-metazoan origin and were probably acquired
horizontally. This apparent convergence between bdelloids and prokaryotes sheds
new light on the evolutionary significance of sex.

eicosanoids.

Phosphorylated sphingolipids ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) and
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have emerged as key regulators of cell growth,
survival, migration and inflammation. C1P produced by ceramide kinase is an
activator of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), the rate-limiting
releaser of arachidonic acid used for pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production,
which contributes to disease pathogenesis in asthma or airway
hyper-responsiveness, cancer, atherosclerosis and thrombosis. To modulate
eicosanoid action and avoid the damaging effects of chronic inflammation, cells
require efficient targeting, trafficking and presentation of C1P to specific
cellular sites. Vesicular trafficking is likely but non-vesicular mechanisms for 
C1P sensing, transfer and presentation remain unexplored. Moreover, the molecular
basis for selective recognition and binding among signalling lipids with
phosphate headgroups, namely C1P, phosphatidic acid or their lyso-derivatives,
remains unclear. Here, a ubiquitously expressed lipid transfer protein, human
GLTPD1, named here CPTP, is shown to specifically transfer C1P between membranes.
Crystal structures establish C1P binding through a novel surface-localized,
phosphate headgroup recognition centre connected to an interior hydrophobic
pocket that adaptively expands to ensheath differing-length lipid chains using a 
cleft-like gating mechanism. The two-layer, α-helically-dominated 'sandwich'
topology identifies CPTP as the prototype for a new glycolipid transfer protein
fold subfamily. CPTP resides in the cell cytosol but associates with the
trans-Golgi network, nucleus and plasma membrane. RNA interference-induced CPTP
depletion elevates C1P steady-state levels and alters Golgi cisternae stack
morphology. The resulting C1P decrease in plasma membranes and increase in the
Golgi complex stimulates cPLA2α release of arachidonic acid, triggering
pro-inflammatory eicosanoid generation.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process involved in several
physiological and pathological processes. Although primarily cytoprotective,
autophagy can also contribute to cell death; it is thus important to understand
what distinguishes the life or death decision in autophagic cells. Here we report
that induction of autophagy is coupled to reduction of histone H4 lysine 16
acetylation (H4K16ac) through downregulation of the histone acetyltransferase
hMOF (also called KAT8 or MYST1), and demonstrate that this histone modification 
regulates the outcome of autophagy. At a genome-wide level, we find that H4K16
deacetylation is associated predominantly with the downregulation of
autophagy-related genes. Antagonizing H4K16ac downregulation upon autophagy
induction results in the promotion of cell death. Our findings establish that
alteration in a specific histone post-translational modification during autophagy
affects the transcriptional regulation of autophagy-related genes and initiates a
regulatory feedback loop, which serves as a key determinant of survival versus
death responses upon autophagy induction.

Folate receptors (FRα, FRβ and FRγ) are cysteine-rich cell-surface glycoproteins 
that bind folate with high affinity to mediate cellular uptake of folate.
Although expressed at very low levels in most tissues, folate receptors,
especially FRα, are expressed at high levels in numerous cancers to meet the
folate demand of rapidly dividing cells under low folate conditions. The folate
dependency of many tumours has been therapeutically and diagnostically exploited 
by administration of anti-FRα antibodies, high-affinity antifolates, folate-based
imaging agents and folate-conjugated drugs and toxins. To understand how folate
binds its receptors, we determined the crystal structure of human FRα in complex 
with folic acid at 2.8 Å resolution. FRα has a globular structure stabilized by
eight disulphide bonds and contains a deep open folate-binding pocket comprised
of residues that are conserved in all receptor subtypes. The folate pteroate
moiety is buried inside the receptor, whereas its glutamate moiety is
solvent-exposed and sticks out of the pocket entrance, allowing it to be
conjugated to drugs without adversely affecting FRα binding. The extensive
interactions between the receptor and ligand readily explain the high
folate-binding affinity of folate receptors and provide a template for designing 
more specific drugs targeting the folate receptor system.

DNA unwinding heterogeneity by RecBCD results from static molecules able to
equilibrate.

Single-molecule studies can overcome the complications of asynchrony and
ensemble-averaging in bulk-phase measurements, provide mechanistic insights into 
molecular activities, and reveal interesting variations between individual
molecules. The application of these techniques to the RecBCD helicase of
Escherichia coli has resolved some long-standing discrepancies, and has provided 
otherwise unattainable mechanistic insights into its enzymatic behaviour.
Enigmatically, the DNA unwinding rates of individual enzyme molecules are seen to
vary considerably, but the origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here we 
investigate the physical basis for this behaviour. Although any individual RecBCD
molecule unwound DNA at a constant rate for an average of approximately
30,000 steps, we discover that transiently halting a single enzyme-DNA complex by
depleting Mg(2+)-ATP could change the subsequent rates of DNA unwinding by that
enzyme after reintroduction to ligand. The proportion of molecules that changed
rate increased exponentially with the duration of the interruption, with a
half-life of approximately 1 second, suggesting that a conformational change
occurred during the time that the molecule was arrested. The velocity after
pausing an individual molecule was any velocity found in the starting
distribution of the ensemble. We suggest that substrate binding stabilizes the
enzyme in one of many equilibrium conformational sub-states that determine the
rate-limiting translocation behaviour of each RecBCD molecule. Each stabilized
sub-state can persist for the duration (approximately 1 minute) of processive
unwinding of a DNA molecule, comprising tens of thousands of catalytic steps,
each of which is much faster than the time needed for the conformational change
required to alter kinetic behaviour. This ligand-dependent stabilization of
rate-defining conformational sub-states results in seemingly static
molecule-to-molecule variation in RecBCD helicase activity, but in fact reflects 
one microstate from the equilibrium ensemble that a single molecule manifests
during an individual processive translocation event.

Digit loss in archosaur evolution and the interplay between selection and
constraints.

Evolution involves interplay between natural selection and developmental
constraints. This is seen, for example, when digits are lost from the limbs
during evolution. Extant archosaurs (crocodiles and birds) show several instances
of digit loss under different selective regimes, and show limbs with one, two,
three, four or the ancestral number of five digits. The 'lost' digits sometimes
persist for millions of years as developmental vestiges. Here we examine digit
loss in the Nile crocodile and five birds, using markers of three successive
stages of digit development. In two independent lineages under different
selection, wing digit I and all its markers disappear. In contrast, hindlimb
digit V persists in all species sampled, both as cartilage, and as Sox9-
expressing precartilage domains, 250 million years after the adult digit
disappeared. There is therefore a mismatch between evolution of the embryonic and
adult phenotypes. All limbs, regardless of digit number, showed similar
expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh). Even in the one-fingered emu wing, expression
of posterior genes Hoxd11 and Hoxd12 was conserved, whereas expression of
anterior genes Gli3 and Alx4 was not. We suggest that the persistence of digit V 
in the embryo may reflect constraints, particularly the conserved posterior gene 
networks associated with the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The more rapid
and complete disappearance of digit I may reflect its ZPA-independent
specification, and hence, weaker developmental constraints. Interacting with
these constraints are selection pressures for limb functions such as flying and
perching. This model may help to explain the diverse patterns of digit loss in
tetrapods. Our study may also help to understand how selection on adults leads to
changes in development.

Amorphous metal oxides are useful in optical, electronic and electrochemical
devices. The bonding arrangement within these glasses largely determines their
properties, yet it remains a challenge to manipulate their structures in a
controlled manner. Recently, we developed synthetic protocols for incorporating
nanocrystals that are covalently bonded into amorphous materials. This
'nanocrystal-in-glass' approach not only combines two functional components in
one material, but also the covalent link enables us to manipulate the glass
structure to change its properties. Here we illustrate the power of this approach
by introducing tin-doped indium oxide nanocrystals into niobium oxide glass
(NbOx), and realize a new amorphous structure as a consequence of linking it to
the nanocrystals. The resulting material demonstrates a previously unrealized
optical switching behaviour that will enable the dynamic control of solar
radiation transmittance through windows. These transparent films can block
near-infrared and visible light selectively and independently by varying the
applied electrochemical voltage over a range of 2.5 volts. We also show that the 
reconstructed NbOx glass has superior properties-its optical contrast is enhanced
fivefold and it has excellent electrochemical stability, with 96 per cent of
charge capacity retained after 2,000 cycles.

Engineered macroscopic quantum systems based on superconducting electronic
circuits are attractive for experimentally exploring diverse questions in quantum
information science. At the current state of the art, quantum bits (qubits) are
fabricated, initialized, controlled, read out and coupled to each other in simple
circuits. This enables the realization of basic logic gates, the creation of
complex entangled states and the demonstration of algorithms or error correction.
Using different variants of low-noise parametric amplifiers, dispersive quantum
non-demolition single-shot readout of single-qubit states with high fidelity has 
enabled continuous and discrete feedback control of single qubits. Here we
realize full deterministic quantum teleportation with feed-forward in a
chip-based superconducting circuit architecture. We use a set of two parametric
amplifiers for both joint two-qubit and individual qubit single-shot readout,
combined with flexible real-time digital electronics. Our device uses a crossed
quantum bus technology that allows us to create complex networks with arbitrary
connecting topology in a planar architecture. The deterministic teleportation
process succeeds with order unit probability for any input state, as we prepare
maximally entangled two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all Bell
states in a single two-qubit measurement with high efficiency and high fidelity. 
We teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a
rate of 10(4) s(-1), exceeding other reported implementations. The low
transmission loss of superconducting waveguides is likely to enable the range of 
this and other schemes to be extended to significantly larger distances, enabling
tests of non-locality and the realization of elements for quantum communication
at microwave frequencies. The demonstrated feed-forward may also find application
in error correction schemes.

Quantum teleportation allows for the transfer of arbitrary unknown quantum states
from a sender to a spatially distant receiver, provided that the two parties
share an entangled state and can communicate classically. It is the essence of
many sophisticated protocols for quantum communication and computation. Photons
are an optimal choice for carrying information in the form of 'flying qubits',
but the teleportation of photonic quantum bits (qubits) has been limited by
experimental inefficiencies and restrictions. Main disadvantages include the
fundamentally probabilistic nature of linear-optics Bell measurements, as well as
the need either to destroy the teleported qubit or attenuate the input qubit when
the detectors do not resolve photon numbers. Here we experimentally realize fully
deterministic quantum teleportation of photonic qubits without post-selection.
The key step is to make use of a hybrid technique involving continuous-variable
teleportation of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit. When the receiver's
feedforward gain is optimally tuned, the continuous-variable teleporter acts as a
pure loss channel, and the input dual-rail-encoded qubit, based on a single
photon, represents a quantum error detection code against photon loss and hence
remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for a
faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect continuous-variable entangled states:
for four qubits the overall transfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 and all
of them exceed the classical limit of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a
relatively low level of the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more
efficiently than in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into
account only the qubit subspaces), and with a fidelity comparable to the
previously reported values.

Soft-γ-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are slowly
rotating, isolated neutron stars that sporadically undergo episodes of long-term 
flux enhancement (outbursts) generally accompanied by the emission of short
bursts of hard X-rays. This behaviour can be understood in the magnetar model,
according to which these sources are mainly powered by their own magnetic energy.
This is supported by the fact that the magnetic fields inferred from several
observed properties of SGRs and AXPs are greater than-or at the high end of the
range of-those of radio pulsars. In the peculiar case of SGR 0418+5729, a weak
dipole magnetic moment is derived from its timing parameters, whereas a strong
field has been proposed to reside in the stellar interior and in multipole
components on the surface. Here we show that the X-ray spectrum of SGR 0418+5729 
has an absorption line, the properties of which depend strongly on the star's
rotational phase. This line is interpreted as a proton cyclotron feature and its 
energy implies a magnetic field ranging from 2 × 10(14) gauss to more than 10(15)
gauss.

The terrestrial biosphere is a key component of the global carbon cycle and its
carbon balance is strongly influenced by climate. Continuing environmental
changes are thought to increase global terrestrial carbon uptake. But evidence is
mounting that climate extremes such as droughts or storms can lead to a decrease 
in regional ecosystem carbon stocks and therefore have the potential to negate an
expected increase in terrestrial carbon uptake. Here we explore the mechanisms
and impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle, and propose a
pathway to improve our understanding of present and future impacts of climate
extremes on the terrestrial carbon budget.

The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli 
is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the
physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain
elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP
signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with
biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic
needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes
increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx,
but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or
sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the
opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained
mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and
predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A
scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling
by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key
physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that
proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in
different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of
quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex
molecular signalling networks.

The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a large multicomponent, dynamic 
macromolecular machine that has an important role in the ecology of many
Gram-negative bacteria. T6SS is responsible for translocation of a wide range of 
toxic effector molecules, allowing predatory cells to kill both prokaryotic as
well as eukaryotic prey cells. The T6SS organelle is functionally analogous to
contractile tails of bacteriophages and is thought to attack cells by initially
penetrating them with a trimeric protein complex called the VgrG spike. Neither
the exact protein composition of the T6SS organelle nor the mechanisms of
effector selection and delivery are known. Here we report that proteins from the 
PAAR (proline-alanine-alanine-arginine) repeat superfamily form a sharp conical
extension on the VgrG spike, which is further involved in attaching effector
domains to the spike. The crystal structures of two PAAR-repeat proteins bound to
VgrG-like partners show that these proteins sharpen the tip of the T6SS spike
complex. We demonstrate that PAAR proteins are essential for T6SS-mediated
secretion and target cell killing by Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi.
Our results indicate a new model of the T6SS organelle in which the VgrG-PAAR
spike complex is decorated with multiple effectors that are delivered
simultaneously into target cells in a single contraction-driven translocation
event.

In Gram-positive bacteria, T-box riboswitches regulate the expression of
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and other proteins in response to fluctuating transfer
RNA aminoacylation levels under various nutritional states. T-boxes reside in the
5'-untranslated regions of the messenger RNAs they regulate, and consist of two
conserved domains. Stem I contains the specifier trinucleotide that base pairs
with the anticodon of cognate tRNA. 3' to stem I is the antiterminator domain,
which base pairs with the tRNA acceptor end and evaluates its aminoacylation
state. Despite high phylogenetic conservation and widespread occurrence in
pathogens, the structural basis of tRNA recognition by this riboswitch remains
ill defined. Here we demonstrate that the ~100-nucleotide T-box stem I is
necessary and sufficient for specific, high-affinity (dissociation constant (Kd) 
~150 nM) tRNA binding, and report the structure of Oceanobacillus iheyensis glyQ 
stem I in complex with its cognate tRNA at 3.2 Å resolution. Stem I recognizes
the overall architecture of tRNA in addition to its anticodon, something
accomplished by large ribonucleoproteins such as the ribosome, or proteins such
as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, but is unprecedented for a compact mRNA domain.
The C-shaped stem I cradles the L-shaped tRNA, forming an extended (1,604 Å(2))
intermolecular interface. In addition to the specifier-anticodon interaction, two
interdigitated T-loops near the apex of stem I stack on the tRNA elbow in a
manner analogous to those of the J11/12-J12/11 motif of RNase P and the L1 stalk 
of the ribosomal E-site. Because these ribonucleoproteins and T-boxes are
unrelated, this strategy to recognize a universal tRNA feature probably evolved
convergently. Mutually induced fit of stem I and the tRNA exploiting the
intrinsic flexibility of tRNA and its conserved post-transcriptional
modifications results in high shape complementarity, which in addition to
providing specificity and affinity, globally organizes the T-box to orchestrate
tRNA-dependent transcription regulation.

No increase in global temperature variability despite changing regional patterns.

Evidence from Greenland ice cores shows that year-to-year temperature variability
was probably higher in some past cold periods, but there is considerable interest
in determining whether global warming is increasing climate variability at
present. This interest is motivated by an understanding that increased
variability and resulting extreme weather conditions may be more difficult for
society to adapt to than altered mean conditions. So far, however, in spite of
suggestions of increased variability, there is considerable uncertainty as to
whether it is occurring. Here we show that although fluctuations in annual
temperature have indeed shown substantial geographical variation over the past
few decades, the time-evolving standard deviation of globally averaged
temperature anomalies has been stable. A feature of the changes has been a
tendency for many regions of low variability to experience increases, which might
contribute to the perception of increased climate volatility. The normalization
of temperature anomalies creates the impression of larger relative overall
increases, but our use of absolute values, which we argue is a more appropriate
approach, reveals little change. Regionally, greater year-to-year changes
recently occurred in much of North America and Europe. Many climate models
predict that total variability will ultimately decrease under high greenhouse gas
concentrations, possibly associated with reductions in sea-ice cover. Our
findings contradict the view that a warming world will automatically be one of
more overall climatic variation.

A key event in the domestication and breeding of the oil palm Elaeis guineensis
was loss of the thick coconut-like shell surrounding the kernel. Modern E.
guineensis has three fruit forms, dura (thick-shelled), pisifera (shell-less) and
tenera (thin-shelled), a hybrid between dura and pisifera. The pisifera palm is
usually female-sterile. The tenera palm yields far more oil than dura, and is the
basis for commercial palm oil production in all of southeast Asia. Here we
describe the mapping and identification of the SHELL gene responsible for the
different fruit forms. Using homozygosity mapping by sequencing, we found two
independent mutations in the DNA-binding domain of a homologue of the MADS-box
gene SEEDSTICK (STK, also known as AGAMOUS-LIKE 11), which controls ovule
identity and seed development in Arabidopsis. The SHELL gene is responsible for
the tenera phenotype in both cultivated and wild palms from sub-Saharan Africa,
and our findings provide a genetic explanation for the single gene hybrid vigour 
(or heterosis) attributed to SHELL, via heterodimerization. This gene mutation
explains the single most important economic trait in oil palm, and has
implications for the competing interests of global edible oil production,
biofuels and rainforest conservation.

Oil palm is the most productive oil-bearing crop. Although it is planted on only 
5% of the total world vegetable oil acreage, palm oil accounts for 33% of
vegetable oil and 45% of edible oil worldwide, but increased cultivation competes
with dwindling rainforest reserves. We report the 1.8-gigabase (Gb) genome
sequence of the African oil palm Elaeis guineensis, the predominant source of
worldwide oil production. A total of 1.535 Gb of assembled sequence and
transcriptome data from 30 tissue types were used to predict at least 34,802
genes, including oil biosynthesis genes and homologues of WRINKLED1 (WRI1), and
other transcriptional regulators, which are highly expressed in the kernel. We
also report the draft sequence of the South American oil palm Elaeis oleifera,
which has the same number of chromosomes (2n = 32) and produces fertile
interspecific hybrids with E. guineensis but seems to have diverged in the New
World. Segmental duplications of chromosome arms define the palaeotetraploid
origin of palm trees. The oil palm sequence enables the discovery of genes for
important traits as well as somaclonal epigenetic alterations that restrict the
use of clones in commercial plantings, and should therefore help to achieve
sustainability for biofuels and edible oils, reducing the rainforest footprint of
this tropical plantation crop.

During translation initiation in eukaryotes, the small ribosomal subunit binds
messenger RNA at the 5' end and scans in the 5' to 3' direction to locate the
initiation codon, form the 80S initiation complex and start protein synthesis.
This simple, yet intricate, process is guided by multiple initiation factors.
Here we determine the structures of three complexes of the small ribosomal
subunit that represent distinct steps in mammalian translation initiation. These 
structures reveal the locations of eIF1, eIF1A, mRNA and initiator transfer RNA
bound to the small ribosomal subunit and provide insights into the details of
translation initiation specific to eukaryotes. Conformational changes associated 
with the captured functional states reveal the dynamics of the interactions in
the P site of the ribosome. These results have functional implications for the
mechanism of mRNA scanning.

During epithelial cell proliferation, planar alignment of the mitotic spindle
coordinates the local process of symmetric cell cleavage with the global
maintenance of polarized tissue architecture. Although the disruption of planar
spindle alignment is proposed to cause epithelial to mesenchymal transition and
cancer, the in vivo mechanisms regulating mitotic spindle orientation remain
elusive. Here we demonstrate that the actomyosin cortex and the
junction-localized neoplastic tumour suppressors Scribbled and Discs large 1 have
essential roles in planar spindle alignment and thus the control of epithelial
integrity in the Drosophila imaginal disc. We show that defective alignment of
the mitotic spindle correlates with cell delamination and apoptotic death, and
that blocking the death of misaligned cells is sufficient to drive the formation 
of basally localized tumour-like masses. These findings indicate a key role for
junction-mediated spindle alignment in the maintenance of epithelial integrity,
and also reveal a previously unknown cell-death-mediated tumour-suppressor
function inherent in the polarized architecture of epithelia.

Down's syndrome is a common disorder with enormous medical and social costs,
caused by trisomy for chromosome 21. We tested the concept that gene imbalance
across an extra chromosome can be de facto corrected by manipulating a single
gene, XIST (the X-inactivation gene). Using genome editing with zinc finger
nucleases, we inserted a large, inducible XIST transgene into the DYRK1A locus on
chromosome 21, in Down's syndrome pluripotent stem cells. The XIST non-coding RNA
coats chromosome 21 and triggers stable heterochromatin modifications,
chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing and DNA methylation to form a
'chromosome 21 Barr body'. This provides a model to study human chromosome
inactivation and creates a system to investigate genomic expression changes and
cellular pathologies of trisomy 21, free from genetic and epigenetic noise.
Notably, deficits in proliferation and neural rosette formation are rapidly
reversed upon silencing one chromosome 21. Successful trisomy silencing in vitro 
also surmounts the major first step towards potential development of 'chromosome 
therapy'.

The epigenetic regulation of imprinted genes by monoallelic DNA methylation of
either maternal or paternal alleles is critical for embryonic growth and
development. Imprinted genes were recently shown to be expressed in mammalian
adult stem cells to support self-renewal of neural and lung stem cells; however, 
a role for imprinting per se in adult stem cells remains elusive. Here we show
upregulation of growth-restricting imprinted genes, including in the H19-Igf2
locus, in long-term haematopoietic stem cells and their downregulation upon
haematopoietic stem cell activation and proliferation. A differentially
methylated region upstream of H19 (H19-DMR), serving as the imprinting control
region, determines the reciprocal expression of H19 from the maternal allele and 
Igf2 from the paternal allele. In addition, H19 serves as a source of miR-675,
which restricts Igf1r expression. We demonstrate that conditional deletion of the
maternal but not the paternal H19-DMR reduces adult haematopoietic stem cell
quiescence, a state required for long-term maintenance of haematopoietic stem
cells, and compromises haematopoietic stem cell function. Maternal-specific
H19-DMR deletion results in activation of the Igf2-Igfr1 pathway, as shown by the
translocation of phosphorylated FoxO3 (an inactive form) from nucleus to
cytoplasm and the release of FoxO3-mediated cell cycle arrest, thus leading to
increased activation, proliferation and eventual exhaustion of haematopoietic
stem cells. Mechanistically, maternal-specific H19-DMR deletion leads to Igf2
upregulation and increased translation of Igf1r, which is normally suppressed by 
H19-derived miR-675. Similarly, genetic inactivation of Igf1r partly rescues the 
H19-DMR deletion phenotype. Our work establishes a new role for this unique form 
of epigenetic control at the H19-Igf2 locus in maintaining adult stem cells.

An Sp1 transcription factor coordinates caspase-dependent and -independent
apoptotic pathways.

During animal development, the proper regulation of apoptosis requires the
precise spatial and temporal execution of cell-death programs, which can include 
both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Although the mechanisms 
of caspase-dependent and -independent cell killing have been examined
extensively, how these pathways are coordinated within a single cell that is
fated to die is unknown. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans Sp1
transcription factor SPTF-3 specifies the programmed cell deaths of at least two 
cells-the sisters of the pharyngeal M4 motor neuron and the AQR sensory neuron-by
transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic
pathways. SPTF-3 directly drives the transcription of the gene egl-1, which
encodes a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis through the activation of the 
CED-3 caspase. In addition, SPTF-3 directly drives the transcription of the
AMP-activated protein kinase-related gene pig-1, which encodes a protein kinase
and functions in apoptosis of the M4 sister and AQR sister independently of the
pathway that activates CED-3 (refs 4, 5). Thus, a single transcription factor
controls two distinct cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive
apoptosis. Our findings reveal a bivalent regulatory node for caspase-dependent
and -independent pathways in the regulation of cell-type-specific apoptosis. We
propose that such nodes might act as features of a general mechanism for
regulating cell-type-specific apoptosis and could be therapeutic targets for
diseases involving the dysregulation of apoptosis through multiple cell-killing
mechanisms.

The fossil record richly illustrates the origin of morphological adaptation
through time. However, our understanding of the selective forces responsible in a
given case, and the role of behaviour in the process, is hindered by assumptions 
of synchrony between environmental change, behavioural innovation and
morphological response. Here I show, from independent proxy data through a
20-million-year sequence of fossil proboscideans in East Africa, that changes in 
environment, diet and morphology are often significantly offset chronologically, 
allowing dissection of the roles of behaviour and different selective drivers.
These findings point the way to hypothesis-driven testing of the interplay
between habitat change, behaviour and morphological adaptation with the use of
independent proxies in the fossil record.

The extraction of directional motion information from changing retinal images is 
one of the earliest and most important processing steps in any visual system. In 
the fly optic lobe, two parallel processing streams have been anatomically
described, leading from two first-order interneurons, L1 and L2, via T4 and T5
cells onto large, wide-field motion-sensitive interneurons of the lobula plate.
Therefore, T4 and T5 cells are thought to have a pivotal role in motion
processing; however, owing to their small size, it is difficult to obtain
electrical recordings of T4 and T5 cells, leaving their visual response
properties largely unknown. We circumvent this problem by means of optical
recording from these cells in Drosophila, using the genetically encoded calcium
indicator GCaMP5 (ref. 2). Here we find that specific subpopulations of T4 and T5
cells are directionally tuned to one of the four cardinal directions; that is,
front-to-back, back-to-front, upwards and downwards. Depending on their preferred
direction, T4 and T5 cells terminate in specific sublayers of the lobula plate.
T4 and T5 functionally segregate with respect to contrast polarity: whereas T4
cells selectively respond to moving brightness increments (ON edges), T5 cells
only respond to moving brightness decrements (OFF edges). When the output from T4
or T5 cells is blocked, the responses of postsynaptic lobula plate neurons to
moving ON (T4 block) or OFF edges (T5 block) are selectively compromised. The
same effects are seen in turning responses of tethered walking flies. Thus,
starting with L1 and L2, the visual input is split into separate ON and OFF
pathways, and motion along all four cardinal directions is computed separately
within each pathway. The output of these eight different motion detectors is then
sorted such that ON (T4) and OFF (T5) motion detectors with the same directional 
tuning converge in the same layer of the lobula plate, jointly providing the
input to downstream circuits and motion-driven behaviours.

The HeLa cell line was established in 1951 from cervical cancer cells taken from 
a patient, Henrietta Lacks. This was the first successful attempt to immortalize 
human-derived cells in vitro. The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of 
HeLa cells resulted in its broad adoption--both intentionally and through
widespread cross-contamination--and for the past 60 years it has served a role
analogous to that of a model organism. The cumulative impact of the HeLa cell
line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than 74,000 PubMed
abstracts (approximately 0.3%). The genomic architecture of HeLa remains largely 
unexplored beyond its karyotype, partly because like many cancers, its extensive 
aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging. We carried out haplotype-resolved
whole-genome sequencing of the HeLa CCL-2 strain, examined point- and
indel-mutation variations, mapped copy-number variations and loss of
heterozygosity regions, and phased variants across full chromosome arms. We also 
investigated variation and copy-number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight additional 
strains. We find that HeLa is relatively stable in terms of point variation, with
few new mutations accumulating after early passaging. Haplotype resolution
facilitated reconstruction of an amplified, highly rearranged region of
chromosome 8q24.21 at which integration of the human papilloma virus type 18
(HPV-18) genome occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated
tumorigenesis. We combined these maps with RNA-seq and ENCODE Project data sets
to phase the HeLa epigenome. This revealed strong, haplotype-specific activation 
of the proto-oncogene MYC by the integrated HPV-18 genome approximately
500 kilobases upstream, and enabled global analyses of the relationship between
gene dosage and expression. These data provide an extensively phased,
high-quality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa,
and demonstrate the value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer
genomes and epigenomes.

A major unsolved problem in mammalian evolution is the origin of Allotheria,
including Multituberculata and Haramiyida. Multituberculates are the most diverse
and best known Mesozoic era mammals and ecologically resemble rodents, but
haramiyids are known mainly from isolated teeth, hampering our search for their
phylogenetic relationships. Here we report a new haramiyid from the Jurassic
period of China, which is, to our knowledge the largest reported so far. It has a
novel dentition, a mandible resembling advanced multituberculates and postcranial
features adapted for arboreal life. Our phylogenetic analysis places Haramiyida
within crown Mammalia, suggesting the origin of crown Mammalia in the Late
Triassic period and diversification in the Jurassic, which contrasts other
estimated divergence times of crown Mammalia. The new haramiyid reveals
additional mammalian features of the group, helps to identify other haramiyids
represented by isolated teeth, and shows again that, regardless of various
phylogenetic scenarios, a complex pattern of evolution involving many
convergences and/or reversals existed in Mesozoic mammals.

Ninety per cent of marine organic matter burial occurs in continental margin
sediments, where a substantial fraction of organic carbon escapes oxidation and
enters long-term geologic storage within sedimentary rocks. In such environments,
microbial metabolism is limited by the diffusive supply of electron acceptors.
One strategy to optimize energy yields in a resource-limited habitat is symbiotic
metabolite exchange among microbial associations. Thermodynamic and geochemical
considerations indicate that microbial co-metabolisms are likely to play a
critical part in sedimentary organic carbon cycling. Yet only one association,
between methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria, has been
demonstrated in marine sediments in situ, and little is known of the role of
microbial symbiotic interactions in other sedimentary biogeochemical cycles. Here
we report in situ molecular and incubation-based evidence for a novel symbiotic
consortium between two chemolithotrophic bacteria--anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing
(anammox) bacteria and the nitrate-sequestering sulphur-oxidizing Thioploca
species--in anoxic sediments of the Soledad basin at the Mexican Pacific margin. 
A mass balance of benthic solute fluxes and the corresponding nitrogen isotope
composition of nitrate and ammonium fluxes indicate that anammox bacteria rely on
Thioploca species for the supply of metabolic substrates and account for about
57 ± 21 per cent of the total benthic N2 production. We show that
Thioploca-anammox symbiosis intensifies benthic fixed nitrogen losses in anoxic
sediments, bypassing diffusion-imposed limitations by efficiently coupling the
carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles.

The growth and reduction of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets over the past million 
years is dominated by an approximately 100,000-year periodicity and a sawtooth
pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that 
summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and
statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to 
eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot
explain the strong 100,000-year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic
feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed
that glacial terminations are associated with the build-up of Northern Hemisphere
'excess ice', but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100,000-year cycle
remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models,
that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and
the lithosphere-asthenosphere system explain the 100,000-year periodicity. The
responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show
hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part
in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the
North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass 
balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose
amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet
grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required
to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is
established, a moderate increase in insolation is sufficient to trigger a
negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet
within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid
ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic
rebound, which is the lithosphere-asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is
involved, but is not determinative, in the evolution of the 100,000-year glacial 
cycles.

Monitoring a mechanical object's motion, even with the gentle touch of light,
fundamentally alters its dynamics. The experimental manifestation of this basic
principle of quantum mechanics, its link to the quantum nature of light and the
extension of quantum measurement to the macroscopic realm have all received
extensive attention over the past half-century. The use of squeezed light, with
quantum fluctuations below that of the vacuum field, was proposed nearly three
decades ago as a means of reducing the optical read-out noise in precision force 
measurements. Conversely, it has also been proposed that a continuous measurement
of a mirror's position with light may itself give rise to squeezed light. Such
squeezed-light generation has recently been demonstrated in a system of ultracold
gas-phase atoms whose centre-of-mass motion is analogous to the motion of a
mirror. Here we describe the continuous position measurement of a solid-state,
optomechanical system fabricated from a silicon microchip and comprising a
micromechanical resonator coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. Laser light sent into
the cavity is used to measure the fluctuations in the position of the mechanical 
resonator at a measurement rate comparable to its resonance frequency and greater
than its thermal decoherence rate. Despite the mechanical resonator's highly
excited thermal state (10(4) phonons), we observe, through homodyne detection,
squeezing of the reflected light's fluctuation spectrum at a level 4.5 ± 0.2 per 
cent below that of vacuum noise over a bandwidth of a few megahertz around the
mechanical resonance frequency of 28 megahertz. With further device improvements,
on-chip squeezing at significant levels should be possible, making such
integrated microscale devices well suited for precision metrology applications.

Animal behaviour arises from computations in neuronal circuits, but our
understanding of these computations has been frustrated by the lack of detailed
synaptic connection maps, or connectomes. For example, despite intensive
investigations over half a century, the neuronal implementation of local motion
detection in the insect visual system remains elusive. Here we develop a
semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome,
containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the
Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from
light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of
the repeating module of the medulla. Within this module, we identified cell types
constituting a motion detection circuit, and showed that the connections onto
individual motion-sensitive neurons in this circuit were consistent with their
direction selectivity. Our results identify cellular targets for future
functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key
insights into neuronal computations.

Comprehensive high-resolution structural maps are central to functional
exploration and understanding in biology. For the nervous system, in which high
resolution and large spatial extent are both needed, such maps are scarce as they
challenge data acquisition and analysis capabilities. Here we present for the
mouse inner plexiform layer--the main computational neuropil region in the
mammalian retina--the dense reconstruction of 950 neurons and their mutual
contacts. This was achieved by applying a combination of crowd-sourced manual
annotation and machine-learning-based volume segmentation to serial block-face
electron microscopy data. We characterize a new type of retinal bipolar
interneuron and show that we can subdivide a known type based on connectivity.
Circuit motifs that emerge from our data indicate a functional mechanism for a
known cellular response in a ganglion cell that detects localized motion, and
predict that another ganglion cell is motion sensitive.

The earliest evolution of mammals and origins of mammalian features can be traced
to the mammaliaforms of the Triassic and Jurassic periods that are extinct
relatives to living mammals. Here we describe a new fossil from the Middle
Jurassic that has a mandibular middle ear, a gradational transition of
thoracolumbar vertebrae and primitive ankle features, but highly derived molars
with a high crown and multiple roots that are partially fused. The upper molars
have longitudinal cusp rows that occlude alternately with those of the lower
molars. This specialization for masticating plants indicates that herbivory
evolved among mammaliaforms, before the rise of crown mammals. The new species
shares the distinctive dental features of the eleutherodontid clade, previously
represented only by isolated teeth despite its extensive geographic distribution 
during the Jurassic. This eleutherodontid was terrestrial and had ambulatory
gaits, analogous to extant terrestrial mammals such as armadillos or rock hyrax. 
Its fur corroborates that mammalian integument had originated well before the
common ancestor of living mammals.

Cellular metabolism converts available nutrients into usable energy and biomass
precursors. The process is regulated to facilitate efficient nutrient use and
metabolic homeostasis. Feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a
pathway by its final product is a classical means of controlling biosynthesis. In
a canonical example, the first committed enzyme in the pyrimidine pathway in
Escherichia coli is allosterically inhibited by cytidine triphosphate. The
physiological consequences of disrupting this regulation, however, have not been 
previously explored. Here we identify an alternative regulatory strategy that
enables precise control of pyrimidine pathway end-product levels, even in the
presence of dysregulated biosynthetic flux. The mechanism involves cooperative
feedback regulation of the near-terminal pathway enzyme uridine monophosphate
kinase. Such feedback leads to build-up of the pathway intermediate uridine
monophosphate, which is in turn degraded by a conserved phosphatase, here termed 
UmpH, with previously unknown physiological function. Such directed overflow
metabolism allows homeostasis of uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate
levels at the expense of uracil excretion and slower growth during energy
limitation. Disruption of the directed overflow regulatory mechanism impairs
growth in pyrimidine-rich environments. Thus, pyrimidine homeostasis involves
dual regulatory strategies, with classical feedback inhibition enhancing
metabolic efficiency and directed overflow metabolism ensuring end-product
homeostasis.

Saturn's moon Enceladus emits a plume of water vapour and micrometre-sized ice
particles from a series of warm fissures located near its south pole. This
geological activity could be powered or controlled by variations in the tidal
stresses experienced by Enceladus as it moves around its slightly eccentric
orbit. The specific mechanisms by which these varying stresses are converted into
heat, however, are still being debated. Furthermore, it has proved difficult to
find a clear correlation between the predicted tidal forces and measured temporal
variations in the plume's gas content or the particle flux from individual
sources. Here we report that the plume's horizontally integrated brightness is
several times greater when Enceladus is near the point in its eccentric orbit
where it is furthest from Saturn (apocentre) than it is when near the point of
closest approach to the planet (pericentre). More material therefore seems to be 
escaping from beneath Enceladus' surface at times when geophysical models predict
its fissures should be under tension and therefore may be wider open.

A latent capacity for evolutionary innovation through exaptation in metabolic
systems.

Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or
pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits. Examples include
feathers, which originated before they were used in flight, and lens crystallins,
which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes. The question of
how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for
evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we
consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems
that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive
importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass
from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to 
sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon
source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We
show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon
source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were
not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability 
on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic
systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus 
contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive
origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have
non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our
ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits.

Manipulation of the gut microbiota holds great promise for the treatment of
inflammatory and allergic diseases. Although numerous probiotic microorganisms
have been identified, there remains a compelling need to discover organisms that 
elicit more robust therapeutic responses, are compatible with the host, and can
affect a specific arm of the host immune system in a well-controlled,
physiological manner. Here we use a rational approach to isolate CD4(+)FOXP3(+)
regulatory T (Treg)-cell-inducing bacterial strains from the human indigenous
microbiota. Starting with a healthy human faecal sample, a sequence of selection 
steps was applied to obtain mice colonized with human microbiota enriched in
Treg-cell-inducing species. From these mice, we isolated and selected 17 strains 
of bacteria on the basis of their high potency in enhancing Treg cell abundance
and inducing important anti-inflammatory molecules--including interleukin-10
(IL-) and inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS)--in Treg cells upon inoculation
into germ-free mice. Genome sequencing revealed that the 17 strains fall within
clusters IV, XIVa and XVIII of Clostridia, which lack prominent toxins and
virulence factors. The 17 strains act as a community to provide bacterial
antigens and a TGF-β-rich environment to help expansion and differentiation of
Treg cells. Oral administration of the combination of 17 strains to adult mice
attenuated disease in models of colitis and allergic diarrhoea. Use of the
isolated strains may allow for tailored therapeutic manipulation of human immune 
disorders.

Generation of inner ear sensory epithelia from pluripotent stem cells in 3D
culture.

The inner ear contains sensory epithelia that detect head movements, gravity and 
sound. It is unclear how to develop these sensory epithelia from pluripotent stem
cells, a process that will be critical for modelling inner ear disorders or
developing cell-based therapies for profound hearing loss and balance disorders. 
So far, attempts to derive inner ear mechanosensitive hair cells and sensory
neurons have resulted in inefficient or incomplete phenotypic conversion of stem 
cells into inner-ear-like cells. A key insight lacking from these previous
studies is the importance of the non-neural and preplacodal ectoderm, two
critical precursors during inner ear development. Here we report the stepwise
differentiation of inner ear sensory epithelia from mouse embryonic stem cells
(ESCs) in three-dimensional culture. We show that by recapitulating in vivo
development with precise temporal control of signalling pathways, ESC aggregates 
transform sequentially into non-neural, preplacodal and otic-placode-like
epithelia. Notably, in a self-organized process that mimics normal development,
vesicles containing prosensory cells emerge from the presumptive otic placodes
and give rise to hair cells bearing stereocilia bundles and a kinocilium.
Moreover, these stem-cell-derived hair cells exhibit functional properties of
native mechanosensitive hair cells and form specialized synapses with sensory
neurons that have also arisen from ESCs in the culture. Finally, we demonstrate
how these vesicles are structurally and biochemically comparable to developing
vestibular end organs. Our data thus establish a new in vitro model of inner ear 
differentiation that can be used to gain deeper insight into inner ear
development and disorder.

The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can
cause severe pulmonary disease in humans, representing the second example of a
highly pathogenic coronavirus, the first being SARS-CoV. CD26 (also known as
dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor
for MERS-CoV. The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates
viral attachment to host cells and virus-cell fusion, thereby initiating
infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by 
presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain 
(RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore,
binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon
resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a
core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique
strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades IV and V 
of the CD26 β-propeller. The atomic details at the interface between the two
binding entities reveal a surprising protein-protein contact mediated mainly by
hydrophilic residues. Sequence alignment indicates, among betacoronaviruses, a
possible structural conservation for the region homologous to the MERS-CoV RBD
core, but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for
virus-specific pathogenesis such as receptor recognition.

Vitamin C induces Tet-dependent DNA demethylation and a blastocyst-like state in

DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification involved in gene
silencing, imprinting, and the suppression of retrotransposons. Global DNA
demethylation occurs in the early embryo and the germ line, and may be mediated
by Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzymes, which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC)
to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Tet enzymes have been studied extensively in
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are generally cultured in the absence of
vitamin C, a potential cofactor for Fe(II) 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzymes
such as Tet enzymes. Here we report that addition of vitamin C to mouse ES cells 
promotes Tet activity, leading to a rapid and global increase in 5hmC. This is
followed by DNA demethylation of many gene promoters and upregulation of
demethylated germline genes. Tet1 binding is enriched near the transcription
start site of genes affected by vitamin C treatment. Importantly, vitamin C, but 
not other antioxidants, enhances the activity of recombinant Tet1 in a
biochemical assay, and the vitamin-C-induced changes in 5hmC and 5mC are entirely
suppressed in Tet1 and Tet2 double knockout ES cells. Vitamin C has a stronger
effect on regions that gain methylation in cultured ES cells compared to
blastocysts, and in vivo are methylated only after implantation. In contrast,
imprinted regions and intracisternal A particle retroelements, which are
resistant to demethylation in the early embryo, are resistant to
vitamin-C-induced DNA demethylation. Collectively, the results of this study
establish vitamin C as a direct regulator of Tet activity and DNA methylation
fidelity in ES cells.

Feeding andesitic eruptions with a high-speed connection from the mantle.

Palisades, New York 10964, USA. ruprecht@ldeo.columbia.edu

Convergent margin volcanism is ultimately fed by magmas generated in the mantle, 
but the connection between the mantle and the eruption at the surface is
typically obscured by cooling, crystallization and magma mixing within the crust.
Geophysical techniques are also not very effective in the lower and middle crust,
where seismic events are rare and resolution is generally poor. It has thus been 
unclear how fast mantle-derived magmas transit the crust and recharge crustal
magma chambers. Here we use diffusion modelling of nickel zonation profiles in
primitive olivines from diverse primary melts to show how mantle recharge may
occur on timescales as short as eruptions themselves. In Irazú volcano in Costa
Rica, magmas apparently ascend from their source region in the mantle through
crust about 35 kilometres thick in just months to years, recharging hybrid
basaltic andesites over the course of the eruption. These results show that large
stratovolcanoes with shallow magma chambers may still preserve the deep record of
their mantle origin in olivine crystals. This approach--documenting magma ascent 
timescales from the mantle beneath a convergent margin stratovolcano--can be
applied to other eruptions that record magma mixing with recharge melts. Signs of
volcanic unrest are typically monitored at the surface or upper crust; new
efforts should look deeper, tracking magma movement from the base of the crust to
the surface in the months to years before eruptions.

Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding
challenge in many areas of modern science and technology. In particular, a
thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of
temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a
powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research.
Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression and
tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the study of
heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced heat
sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer
biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate a new approach
to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin
associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes
it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of
9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy
centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local
thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by
introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human
embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at 
the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.

Globular clusters trace the formation history of the spheroidal components of our
Galaxy and other galaxies, which represent the bulk of star formation over the
history of the Universe. The clusters exhibit a range of metallicities
(abundances of elements heavier than helium), with metal-poor clusters dominating
the stellar halo of the Galaxy, and higher-metallicity clusters found within the 
inner Galaxy, associated with the stellar bulge, or the thick disk. Age
differences between these clusters can indicate the sequence in which the
components of the Galaxy formed, and in particular which clusters were formed
outside the Galaxy and were later engulfed along with their original host
galaxies, and which were formed within it. Here we report an absolute age of
9.9 ± 0.7 billion years (at 95 per cent confidence) for the metal-rich globular
cluster 47 Tucanae, determined by modelling the properties of the cluster's
white-dwarf cooling sequence. This is about two billion years younger than has
been inferred for the metal-poor cluster NGC 6397 from the same models, and
provides quantitative evidence that metal-rich clusters like 47 Tucanae formed
later than metal-poor halo clusters like NGC 6397.

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk is strongly influenced by genetic
factors such as the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (referred to here 
as APOE4), as well as non-genetic determinants including ageing. To pursue
mechanisms by which these affect human brain physiology and modify LOAD risk, we 
initially analysed whole-transcriptome cerebral cortex gene expression data in
unaffected APOE4 carriers and LOAD patients. APOE4 carrier status was associated 
with a consistent transcriptomic shift that broadly resembled the LOAD profile.
Differential co-expression correlation network analysis of the APOE4 and LOAD
transcriptomic changes identified a set of candidate core regulatory mediators.
Several of these--including APBA2, FYN, RNF219 and SV2A--encode known or novel
modulators of LOAD associated amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP) endocytosis
and metabolism. Furthermore, a genetic variant within RNF219 was found to affect 
amyloid deposition in human brain and LOAD age-of-onset. These data implicate an 
APOE4 associated molecular pathway that promotes LOAD.

Sea surface temperature (SST) is a critical control on the atmosphere, and
numerical models of atmosphere-ocean circulation emphasize its accurate
prediction. Yet many models demonstrate large, systematic biases in simulated SST
in the equatorial 'cold tongues' (expansive regions of net heat uptake from the
atmosphere) of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, particularly with regard to a
central but little-understood feature of tropical oceans: a strong seasonal
cycle. The biases may be related to the inability of models to constrain
turbulent mixing realistically, given that turbulent mixing, combined with
seasonal variations in atmospheric heating, determines SST. In temperate oceans, 
the seasonal SST cycle is clearly related to varying solar heating; in the
tropics, however, SSTs vary seasonally in the absence of similar variations in
solar inputs. Turbulent mixing has long been a likely explanation, but firm,
long-term observational evidence has been absent. Here we show the existence of a
distinctive seasonal cycle of subsurface cooling via mixing in the equatorial
Pacific cold tongue, using multi-year measurements of turbulence in the ocean. In
boreal spring, SST rises by 2 kelvin when heating of the upper ocean by the
atmosphere exceeds cooling by mixing from below. In boreal summer, SST decreases 
because cooling from below exceeds heating from above. When the effects of
lateral advection are considered, the magnitude of summer cooling via mixing (4
kelvin per month) is equivalent to that required to counter the heating terms.
These results provide quantitative assessment of how mixing varies on timescales 
longer than a few weeks, clearly showing its controlling influence on seasonal
cooling of SST in a critical oceanic regime.

Species capable of regenerating lost body parts occur throughout the animal
kingdom, yet close relatives are often regeneration incompetent. Why in the face 
of 'survival of the fittest' some animals regenerate but others do not remains a 
fascinating question. Planarian flatworms are well known and studied for their
ability to regenerate from minute tissue pieces, yet species with limited
regeneration abilities have been described even amongst planarians. Here we
report the characterization of the regeneration defect in the planarian
Dendrocoelum lacteum and its successful rescue. Tissue fragments cut from the
posterior half of the body of this species are unable to regenerate a head and
ultimately die. We find that this defect originates during the early stages of
head specification, which require inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling in other
planarian species. Notably, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of
Dlac-β-catenin-1, the Wnt signal transducer, restored the regeneration of fully
functional heads on tail pieces, rescuing D. lacteum's regeneration defect. Our
results demonstrate the utility of comparative studies towards the reactivation
of regenerative abilities in regeneration-deficient animals. Furthermore, the
availability of D. lacteum as a regeneration-impaired planarian model species
provides a first step towards elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms that
ultimately determine why some animals regenerate and others do not.

Variability of regenerative potential among animals has long perplexed
biologists. On the basis of their exceptional regenerative abilities, planarians 
have become important models for understanding the molecular basis of
regeneration. However, planarian species with limited regenerative abilities are 
also found. Despite the importance of understanding the differences between
closely related, regenerating and non-regenerating organisms, few studies have
focused on the evolutionary loss of regeneration, and the molecular mechanisms
leading to such regenerative loss remain obscure. Here we examine Procotyla
fluviatilis, a planarian with restricted ability to replace missing tissues,
using next-generation sequencing to define the gene expression programs active in
regeneration-permissive and regeneration-deficient tissues. We found that Wnt
signalling is aberrantly activated in regeneration-deficient tissues. Notably,
downregulation of canonical Wnt signalling in regeneration-deficient regions
restores regenerative abilities: blastemas form and new heads regenerate in
tissues that normally never regenerate. This work reveals that manipulating a
single signalling pathway can reverse the evolutionary loss of regenerative
potential.

The planarian Dugesia japonica can regenerate a complete individual from a head, 
trunk or tail fragment via activation of somatic pluripotent stem cells. About a 
century ago, Thomas Hunt Morgan attempted to explain the extraordinary
regenerative ability of planarians by positing two opposing morphogenetic
gradients of formative "head stuff" and "tail stuff" along the anterior-posterior
axis. However, Morgan's hypothesis remains open to debate. Here we show that
extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathways
establish a solid framework for planarian regeneration. Our data suggest that ERK
signalling forms a spatial gradient in the anterior region during regeneration.
The fibroblast growth factor receptor-like gene nou-darake (which serves as an
output of ERK signalling in the differentiating head) and posteriorly biased
β-catenin activity negatively regulate ERK signalling along the
anterior-posterior axis in distinct manners, and thereby posteriorize
regenerating tissues outside the head region to reconstruct a complete
head-to-tail axis. On the basis of this knowledge about D. japonica, we proposed 
that β-catenin signalling is responsible for the lack of head-regenerative
ability of tail fragments in the planarian Phagocata kawakatsui, and our
confirmation thereof supports the notion that posterior β-catenin signalling
negatively modulates the ERK signalling involved in anteriorization across
planarian species. These findings suggest that ERK signalling has a pivotal role 
in triggering globally dynamic differentiation of stem cells in a head-to-tail
sequence through a default program that promotes head tissue specification in the
absence of posteriorizing signals. Thus, we have confirmed the broad outline of
Morgan's hypothesis, and refined it on the basis of our proposed default property
of planarian stem cells.

Research in stretchable conductors is fuelled by diverse technological needs.
Flexible electronics, neuroprosthetic and cardiostimulating implants, soft
robotics and other curvilinear systems require materials with high conductivity
over a tensile strain of 100 per cent (refs 1-3). Furthermore, implantable
devices or stretchable displays need materials with conductivities a thousand
times higher while retaining a strain of 100 per cent. However, the molecular
mechanisms that operate during material deformation and stiffening make
stretchability and conductivity fundamentally difficult properties to combine.
The macroscale stretching of solids elongates chemical bonds, leading to the
reduced overlap and delocalization of electronic orbitals. This
conductivity-stretchability dilemma can be exemplified by liquid metals, in which
conduction pathways are retained on large deformation but weak interatomic bonds 
lead to compromised strength. The best-known stretchable conductors use polymer
matrices containing percolated networks of high-aspect-ratio nanometre-scale
tubes or nanowires to address this dilemma to some extent. Further improvements
have been achieved by using fillers (the conductive component) with increased
aspect ratio, of all-metallic composition, or with specific alignment (the way
the fillers are arranged in the matrix). However, the synthesis and separation of
high-aspect-ratio fillers is challenging, stiffness increases with the volume
content of metallic filler, and anisotropy increases with alignment. Pre-strained
substrates, buckled microwires and three-dimensional microfluidic polymer
networks have also been explored. Here we demonstrate stretchable conductors of
polyurethane containing spherical nanoparticles deposited by either
layer-by-layer assembly or vacuum-assisted flocculation. High conductivity and
stretchability were observed in both composites despite the minimal aspect ratio 
of the nanoparticles. These materials also demonstrate the electronic tunability 
of mechanical properties, which arise from the dynamic self-organization of the
nanoparticles under stress. A modified percolation theory incorporating the
self-assembly behaviour of nanoparticles gave an excellent match with the
experimental data.

The epiblast is the mammalian embryonic tissue that contains the pluripotent stem
cells that generate the whole embryo. We have established a method for inducing
functional genetic mosaics in the mouse. Using this system, here we show that
induction of a mosaic imbalance of Myc expression in the epiblast provokes the
expansion of cells with higher Myc levels through the apoptotic elimination of
cells with lower levels, without disrupting development. In contrast, homogeneous
shifts in Myc levels did not affect epiblast cell viability, indicating that the 
observed competition results from comparison of relative Myc levels between
epiblast cells. During normal development we found that Myc levels are
intrinsically heterogeneous among epiblast cells, and that endogenous cell
competition refines the epiblast cell population through the elimination of cells
with low relative Myc levels. These results show that natural cell competition in
the early mammalian embryo contributes to the selection of the epiblast cell
pool.

Protein folding is often described as a search process, in which polypeptides
explore different conformations to find their native structure. Molecular
chaperones are known to improve folding yields by suppressing aggregation between
polypeptides before this conformational search starts, as well as by rescuing
misfolds after it ends. Although chaperones have long been speculated to also
affect the conformational search itself--by reshaping the underlying folding
landscape along the folding trajectory--direct experimental evidence has been
scarce so far. In Escherichia coli, the general chaperone trigger factor (TF)
could play such a role. TF has been shown to interact with nascent chains at the 
ribosome, with polypeptides released from the ribosome into the cytosol, and with
fully folded proteins before their assembly into larger complexes. To investigate
the effect of TF from E. coli on the conformational search of polypeptides to
their native state, we investigated individual maltose binding protein (MBP)
molecules using optical tweezers. Here we show that TF binds folded structures
smaller than one domain, which are then stable for seconds and ultimately convert
to the native state. Moreover, TF stimulates native folding in constructs of
repeated MBP domains. The results indicate that TF promotes correct folding by
protecting partially folded states from distant interactions that produce stable 
misfolded states. As TF interacts with most newly synthesized proteins in E.
coli, we expect these findings to be of general importance in understanding
protein folding pathways.

All forms of locomotion are repetitive motor activities that require coordinated 
bilateral activation of muscles. The executive elements of locomotor control are 
networks of spinal neurons that determine gait pattern through the sequential
activation of motor-neuron pools on either side of the body axis. However, little
is known about the constraints that link left-right coordination to locomotor
speed. Recent advances have indicated that both excitatory and inhibitory
commissural neurons may be involved in left-right coordination. But the neural
underpinnings of this, and a possible causal link between these different groups 
of commissural neurons and left-right alternation, are lacking. Here we show,
using intersectional mouse genetics, that ablation of a group of
transcriptionally defined commissural neurons--the V0 population--leads to a
quadrupedal hopping at all frequencies of locomotion. The selective ablation of
inhibitory V0 neurons leads to a lack of left-right pattern at low frequencies,
mixed coordination at medium frequencies, and alternation at high locomotor
frequencies. When ablation is targeted to excitatory V0 neurons, left-right
alternation is present at low frequencies, and hopping is restricted to medium
and high locomotor frequencies. Therefore, the intrinsic logic of the central
control of locomotion incorporates a modular organization, with two subgroups of 
V0 neurons required for the existence of left-right alternating modes at
different speeds of locomotion. The two molecularly distinct sets of commissural 
neurons may constrain species-related naturally occurring frequency-dependent
coordination and be involved in the evolution of different gaits.

Transcription factors are frequently altered in leukaemia through chromosomal
translocation, mutation or aberrant expression. AML1-ETO, a fusion protein
generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukaemia, is a
transcription factor implicated in both gene repression and activation. AML1-ETO 
oligomerization, mediated by the NHR2 domain, is critical for leukaemogenesis,
making it important to identify co-regulatory factors that 'read' the NHR2
oligomerization and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Here we show that, in human
leukaemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable
AML1-ETO-containing transcription factor complex (AETFC) that contains several
haematopoietic transcription (co)factors. These AETFC components stabilize the
complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains
for diverse target genes, co-localize genome wide, cooperatively regulate gene
expression, and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Within the AETFC complex, AML1-ETO
oligomerization is required for a specific interaction between the oligomerized
NHR2 domain and a novel NHR2-binding (N2B) motif in E proteins. Crystallographic 
analysis of the NHR2-N2B complex reveals a unique interaction pattern in which an
N2B peptide makes direct contact with side chains of two NHR2 domains as a dimer,
providing a novel model of how dimeric/oligomeric transcription factors create a 
new protein-binding interface through dimerization/oligomerization. Intriguingly,
disruption of this interaction by point mutations abrogates AML1-ETO-induced
haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and leukaemogenesis. These
results reveal new mechanisms of action of AML1-ETO, and provide a potential
therapeutic target in t(8;21)-positive acute myeloid leukaemia.

During normal translation, the binding of a release factor to one of the three
stop codons (UGA, UAA or UAG) results in the termination of protein synthesis.
However, modification of the initial uridine to a pseudouridine (Ψ) allows
efficient recognition and read-through of these stop codons by a transfer RNA
(tRNA), although it requires the formation of two normally forbidden
purine-purine base pairs. Here we determined the crystal structure at 3.1 Å
resolution of the 30S ribosomal subunit in complex with the anticodon stem loop
of tRNA(Ser) bound to the ΨAG stop codon in the A site. The ΨA base pair at the
first position is accompanied by the formation of purine-purine base pairs at the
second and third positions of the codon, which show an unusual
Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen geometry. The structure shows a previously unsuspected
ability of the ribosomal decoding centre to accommodate non-canonical base pairs.

The multidrug efflux transporter AcrB and its homologues are important in the
multidrug resistance of Gram-negative pathogens. However, despite efforts to
develop efflux inhibitors, clinically useful inhibitors are not available at
present. Pyridopyrimidine derivatives are AcrB- and MexB-specific inhibitors that
do not inhibit MexY; MexB and MexY are principal multidrug exporters in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have previously determined the crystal structure of
AcrB in the absence and presence of antibiotics. Drugs were shown to be exported 
by a functionally rotating mechanism through tandem proximal and distal multisite
drug-binding pockets. Here we describe the first inhibitor-bound structures of
AcrB and MexB, in which these proteins are bound by a pyridopyrimidine
derivative. The pyridopyrimidine derivative binds tightly to a narrow pit
composed of a phenylalanine cluster located in the distal pocket and sterically
hinders the functional rotation. This pit is a hydrophobic trap that branches off
from the substrate-translocation channel. Phe 178 is located at the edge of this 
trap in AcrB and MexB and contributes to the tight binding of the inhibitor
molecule through a π-π interaction with the pyridopyrimidine ring. The voluminous
side chain of Trp 177 located at the corresponding position in MexY prevents
inhibitor binding. The structure of the hydrophobic trap described in this study 
will contribute to the development of universal inhibitors of MexB and MexY in P.
aeruginosa.

The activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID; also known as AICDA) enzyme is
required for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination at the
immunoglobulin locus. In germinal-centre B cells, AID is highly expressed, and
has an inherent mutator activity that helps generate antibody diversity. However,
AID may also regulate gene expression epigenetically by directly deaminating
5-methylcytosine in concert with base-excision repair to exchange cytosine. This 
pathway promotes gene demethylation, thereby removing epigenetic memory. For
example, AID promotes active demethylation of the genome in primordial germ
cells. However, different studies have suggested either a requirement or a lack
of function for AID in promoting pluripotency in somatic nuclei after fusion with
embryonic stem cells. Here we tested directly whether AID regulates epigenetic
memory by comparing the relative ability of cells lacking AID to reprogram from a
differentiated murine cell type to an induced pluripotent stem cell. We show that
Aid-null cells are transiently hyper-responsive to the reprogramming process.
Although they initiate expression of pluripotency genes, they fail to stabilize
in the pluripotent state. The genome of Aid-null cells remains hypermethylated in
reprogramming cells, and hypermethylated genes associated with pluripotency fail 
to be stably upregulated, including many MYC target genes. Recent studies
identified a late step of reprogramming associated with methylation status, and
implicated a secondary set of pluripotency network components. AID regulates this
late step, removing epigenetic memory to stabilize the pluripotent state.

Replying to S. Våge, J. E. Storesund & T. F. Thingstad Nature 499,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12387 (2013). In the debate about top-down versus
bottom-up control, most would argue that both are important. The most probable
scenario is that in the absence of high rates of transport, the equilibrium
between these competing processes determines bacterial abundance. In their Brief 
Communication Arising, Våge and co-workers respond to our Letter, arguing the
case for defense specialism. ‘Defence specialism’ is not synonymous with
‘defence’. Because of the prevalence of viruses, it is probable that most
bacteria have acquired defences against predation. ‘Defence specialism’ refers to
success by defence, in the sense that a cell might allocate a large proportion of
its resources to defence and thereby become successful.

Arising from Y. Zhao et al. Nature 494, 357–360 (2013). The recent findings of
abundant SAR11 viruses by Zhao et al. are intriguing, and add new insight into
the on-going discussion of why SAR11 bacteria are highly successful in the
pelagic ocean. On the basis of high SAR11 virus abundance, Zhao et al. claim that
SAR11 bacteria are competition specialists. Alternatively, we show here how their
findings could be consistent with a dominance of defensive SAR11 strains.
Considering their high abundance, understanding why SAR11 bacteria are so
successful has important implications for the study of the pelagic ecosystem.

Nearly 50 years ago Bjerknes suggested that the character of large-scale air-sea 
interaction over the mid-latitude North Atlantic Ocean differs with timescales:
the atmosphere was thought to drive directly most short-term--interannual--sea
surface temperature (SST) variability, and the ocean to contribute significantly 
to long-term--multidecadal--SST and potentially atmospheric variability. Although
the conjecture for short timescales is well accepted, understanding Atlantic
multidecadal variability (AMV) of SST remains a challenge as a result of limited 
ocean observations. AMV is nonetheless of major socio-economic importance because
it is linked to important climate phenomena such as Atlantic hurricane activity
and Sahel rainfall, and it hinders the detection of anthropogenic signals in the 
North Atlantic sector. Direct evidence of the oceanic influence of AMV can only
be provided by surface heat fluxes, the language of ocean-atmosphere
communication. Here we provide observational evidence that in the mid-latitude
North Atlantic and on timescales longer than 10 years, surface turbulent heat
fluxes are indeed driven by the ocean and may force the atmosphere, whereas on
shorter timescales the converse is true, thereby confirming the Bjerknes
conjecture. This result, although strongest in boreal winter, is found in all
seasons. Our findings suggest that the predictability of mid-latitude North
Atlantic air-sea interaction could extend beyond the ocean to the climate of
surrounding continents.

Electronic devices have advanced from their heavy, bulky origins to become smart,
mobile appliances. Nevertheless, they remain rigid, which precludes their
intimate integration into everyday life. Flexible, textile and stretchable
electronics are emerging research areas and may yield mainstream technologies.
Rollable and unbreakable backplanes with amorphous silicon field-effect
transistors on steel substrates only 3 μm thick have been demonstrated. On
polymer substrates, bending radii of 0.1 mm have been achieved in flexible
electronic devices. Concurrently, the need for compliant electronics that can not
only be flexed but also conform to three-dimensional shapes has emerged.
Approaches include the transfer of ultrathin polyimide layers encapsulating
silicon CMOS circuits onto pre-stretched elastomers, the use of conductive
elastomers integrated with organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) on polyimide 
islands, and fabrication of OFETs and gold interconnects on elastic substrates to
realize pressure, temperature and optical sensors. Here we present a platform
that makes electronics both virtually unbreakable and imperceptible. Fabricated
directly on ultrathin (1 μm) polymer foils, our electronic circuits are light (3 
g m(-2)) and ultraflexible and conform to their ambient, dynamic environment.
Organic transistors with an ultra-dense oxide gate dielectric a few nanometres
thick formed at room temperature enable sophisticated large-area electronic foils
with unprecedented mechanical and environmental stability: they withstand
repeated bending to radii of 5 μm and less, can be crumpled like paper,
accommodate stretching up to 230% on prestrained elastomers, and can be operated 
at high temperatures and in aqueous environments. Because manufacturing costs of 
organic electronics are potentially low, imperceptible electronic foils may be as
common in the future as plastic wrap is today. Applications include
matrix-addressed tactile sensor foils for health care and monitoring, thin-film
heaters, temperature and infrared sensors, displays, and organic solar cells.

Solving the Martian meteorite age conundrum using micro-baddeleyite and
launch-generated zircon.

Invaluable records of planetary dynamics and evolution can be recovered from the 
geochemical systematics of single meteorites. However, the interpreted ages of
the ejected igneous crust of Mars differ by up to four billion years, a conundrum
due in part to the difficulty of using geochemistry alone to distinguish between 
the ages of formation and the ages of the impact events that launched debris
towards Earth. Here we solve the conundrum by combining in situ electron-beam
nanostructural analyses and U-Pb (uranium-lead) isotopic measurements of the
resistant micromineral baddeleyite (ZrO2) and host igneous minerals in the highly
shock-metamorphosed shergottite Northwest Africa 5298 (ref. 8), which is a
basaltic Martian meteorite. We establish that the micro-baddeleyite grains
pre-date the launch event because they are shocked, cogenetic with host igneous
minerals, and preserve primary igneous growth zoning. The grains least affected
by shock disturbance, and which are rich in radiogenic Pb, date the basalt
crystallization near the Martian surface to 187 ± 33 million years before
present. Primitive, non-radiogenic Pb isotope compositions of the host minerals, 
common to most shergottites, do not help us to date the meteorite, instead
indicating a magma source region that was fractionated more than four billion
years ago to form a persistent reservoir so far unique to Mars. Local impact
melting during ejection from Mars less than 22 ± 2 million years ago caused the
growth of unshocked, launch-generated zircon and the partial disturbance of
baddeleyite dates. We can thus confirm the presence of ancient, non-convecting
mantle beneath young volcanic Mars, place an upper bound on the interplanetary
travel time of the ejected Martian crust, and validate a new approach to the
geochronology of the inner Solar System.

The under-abundance of very massive galaxies in the Universe is frequently
attributed to the effect of galactic winds. Although ionized galactic winds are
readily observable, most of the expelled mass (that is, the total mass flowing
out from the nuclear region) is likely to be in atomic and molecular phases that 
are cooler than the ionized phases. Expanding molecular shells observed in
starburst systems such as NGC 253 (ref. 12) and M 82 (refs 13, 14) may facilitate
the entrainment of molecular gas in the wind. Although shell properties are well 
constrained, determining the amount of outflowing gas emerging from such shells
and the connection between this gas and the ionized wind requires spatial
resolution better than 100 parsecs coupled with sensitivity to a wide range of
spatial scales, a combination hitherto not available. Here we report observations
of NGC 253, a nearby starburst galaxy (distance ∼ 3.4 megaparsecs) known to
possess a wind, that trace the cool molecular wind at 50-parsec resolution. At
this resolution, the extraplanar molecular gas closely tracks the Hα filaments,
and it appears to be connected to expanding molecular shells located in the
starburst region. These observations allow us to determine that the molecular
outflow rate is greater than 3 solar masses per year and probably about 9 solar
masses per year. This implies a ratio of mass-outflow rate to star-formation rate
of at least 1, and probably ∼3, indicating that the starburst-driven wind limits 
the star-formation activity and the final stellar content.

Research on graphene and other two-dimensional atomic crystals is intense and is 
likely to remain one of the leading topics in condensed matter physics and
materials science for many years. Looking beyond this field, isolated atomic
planes can also be reassembled into designer heterostructures made layer by layer
in a precisely chosen sequence. The first, already remarkably complex, such
heterostructures (often referred to as 'van der Waals') have recently been
fabricated and investigated, revealing unusual properties and new phenomena. Here
we review this emerging research area and identify possible future directions.
With steady improvement in fabrication techniques and using graphene's
springboard, van der Waals heterostructures should develop into a large field of 
their own.

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, is required for the survival,
proliferation and differentiation of various cell types. Germline activating
mutations in PTPN11 cause Noonan syndrome, whereas somatic PTPN11 mutations cause
childhood myeloproliferative disease and contribute to some solid tumours.
Recently, heterozygous inactivating mutations in PTPN11 were found in
metachondromatosis, a rare inherited disorder featuring multiple exostoses,
enchondromas, joint destruction and bony deformities. The detailed pathogenesis
of this disorder has remained unclear. Here we use a conditional knockout
(floxed) Ptpn11 allele (Ptpn11(fl)) and Cre recombinase transgenic mice to delete
Ptpn11 specifically in monocytes, macrophages and osteoclasts (lysozyme M-Cre;
LysMCre) or in cathepsin K (Ctsk)-expressing cells, previously thought to be
osteoclasts. LysMCre;Ptpn11(fl/fl) mice had mild osteopetrosis. Notably, however,
CtskCre;Ptpn11(fl/fl) mice developed features very similar to metachondromatosis.
Lineage tracing revealed a novel population of CtskCre-expressing cells in the
perichondrial groove of Ranvier that display markers and functional properties
consistent with mesenchymal progenitors. Chondroid neoplasms arise from these
cells and show decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway
activation, increased Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and parathyroid hormone-related
protein (Pthrp, also known as Pthlh) expression and excessive proliferation.
Shp2-deficient chondroprogenitors had decreased fibroblast growth factor-evoked
ERK activation and enhanced Ihh and Pthrp expression, whereas fibroblast growth
factor receptor (FGFR) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor
treatment of chondroid cells increased Ihh and Pthrp expression. Importantly,
smoothened inhibitor treatment ameliorated metachondromatosis features in
CtskCre;Ptpn11(fl/fl) mice. Thus, in contrast to its pro-oncogenic role in
haematopoietic and epithelial cells, Ptpn11 is a tumour suppressor in cartilage, 
acting through a FGFR/MEK/ERK-dependent pathway in a novel progenitor cell
population to prevent excessive Ihh production.

Structural analysis of class B G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), cell-surface 
proteins that respond to peptide hormones, has been restricted to the
amino-terminal extracellular domain, thus providing little understanding of the
membrane-spanning signal transduction domain. The corticotropin-releasing factor 
receptor type 1 is a class B receptor which mediates the response to stress and
has been considered a drug target for depression and anxiety. Here we report the 
crystal structure of the transmembrane domain of the human
corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 1 in complex with the small-molecule
antagonist CP-376395. The structure provides detailed insight into the
architecture of class B receptors. Atomic details of the interactions of the
receptor with the non-peptide ligand that binds deep within the receptor are
described. This structure provides a model for all class B GPCRs and may aid in
the design of new small-molecule drugs for diseases of brain and metabolism.

Binding of the glucagon peptide to the glucagon receptor (GCGR) triggers the
release of glucose from the liver during fasting; thus GCGR plays an important
role in glucose homeostasis. Here we report the crystal structure of the seven
transmembrane helical domain of human GCGR at 3.4 Å resolution, complemented by
extensive site-specific mutagenesis, and a hybrid model of glucagon bound to GCGR
to understand the molecular recognition of the receptor for its native ligand.
Beyond the shared seven transmembrane fold, the GCGR transmembrane domain
deviates from class A G-protein-coupled receptors with a large ligand-binding
pocket and the first transmembrane helix having a 'stalk' region that extends
three alpha-helical turns above the plane of the membrane. The stalk positions
the extracellular domain (~12 kilodaltons) relative to the membrane to form the
glucagon-binding site that captures the peptide and facilitates the insertion of 
glucagon's amino terminus into the seven transmembrane domain.

Solitons-solitary waves that maintain their shape as they propagate-occur as
water waves in narrow canals, as light pulses in optical fibres and as quantum
mechanical matter waves in superfluids and superconductors. Their highly
nonlinear and localized nature makes them very sensitive probes of the medium in 
which they propagate. Here we create long-lived solitons in a strongly
interacting superfluid of fermionic atoms and directly observe their motion. As
the interactions are tuned from the regime of Bose-Einstein condensation of
tightly bound molecules towards the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer limit of long-range
Cooper pairs, the solitons' effective mass increases markedly, to more than 200
times their bare mass, signalling strong quantum fluctuations. This mass
enhancement is more than 50 times larger than the theoretically predicted value. 
Our work provides a benchmark for theories of non-equilibrium dynamics of
strongly interacting fermions.

Genome sequencing enhances our understanding of the biological world by providing
blueprints for the evolutionary and functional diversity that shapes the
biosphere. However, microbial genomes that are currently available are of limited
phylogenetic breadth, owing to our historical inability to cultivate most
microorganisms in the laboratory. We apply single-cell genomics to target and
sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats
belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called
'microbial dark matter'. With this additional genomic information, we are able to
resolve many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new
superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our
understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three
domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an
archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea 
similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to
phylogenetically anchor up to 20% of metagenomic reads in some habitats,
facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study
greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a
systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our
planet.

High frequency of functional extinctions in ecological networks.

Intensified exploitation of natural populations and habitats has led to increased
mortality rates and decreased abundances of many species. There is a growing
concern that this might cause critical abundance thresholds of species to be
crossed, with extinction cascades and state shifts in ecosystems as a
consequence. When increased mortality rate and decreased abundance of a given
species lead to extinction of other species, this species can be characterized as
functionally extinct even though it still exists. Although such functional
extinctions have been observed in some ecosystems, their frequency is largely
unknown. Here we use a new modelling approach to explore the frequency and
pattern of functional extinctions in ecological networks. Specifically, we
analytically derive critical abundance thresholds of species by increasing their 
mortality rates until an extinction occurs in the network. Applying this approach
on natural and theoretical food webs, we show that the species most likely to go 
extinct first is not the one whose mortality rate is increased but instead
another species. Indeed, up to 80% of all first extinctions are of another
species, suggesting that a species' ecological functionality is often lost before
its own existence is threatened. Furthermore, we find that large-bodied species
at the top of the food chains can only be exposed to small increases in mortality
rate and small decreases in abundance before going functionally extinct compared 
to small-bodied species lower in the food chains. These results illustrate the
potential importance of functional extinctions in ecological networks and lend
strong support to arguments advocating a more community-oriented approach in
conservation biology, with target levels for populations based on ecological
functionality rather than on mere persistence.

Human infection associated with a novel reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus
has recently been identified in China. A total of 132 confirmed cases and 39
deaths have been reported. Most patients presented with severe pneumonia and
acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although the first epidemic has subsided,
the presence of a natural reservoir and the disease severity highlight the need
to evaluate its risk on human public health and to understand the possible
pathogenesis mechanism. Here we show that the emerging H7N9 avian influenza virus
poses a potentially high risk to humans. We discover that the H7N9 virus can bind
to both avian-type (α2,3-linked sialic acid) and human-type (α2,6-linked sialic
acid) receptors. It can invade epithelial cells in the human lower respiratory
tract and type II pneumonocytes in alveoli, and replicated efficiently in ex vivo
lung and trachea explant culture and several mammalian cell lines. In acute serum
samples of H7N9-infected patients, increased levels of the chemokines and
cytokines IP-10, MIG, MIP-1β, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-α were detected. We note 
that the human population is naive to the H7N9 virus, and current seasonal
vaccination could not provide protection.

Most great ape genetic variation remains uncharacterized; however, its study is
critical for understanding population history, recombination, selection and
susceptibility to disease. Here we sequence to high coverage a total of 79 wild- 
and captive-born individuals representing all six great ape species and seven
subspecies and report 88.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our analysis 
provides support for genetically distinct populations within each species,
signals of gene flow, and the split of common chimpanzees into two distinct
groups: Nigeria-Cameroon/western and central/eastern populations. We find
extensive inbreeding in almost all wild populations, with eastern gorillas being 
the most extreme. Inferred effective population sizes have varied radically over 
time in different lineages and this appears to have a profound effect on the
genetic diversity at, or close to, genes in almost all species. We discover and
assign 1,982 loss-of-function variants throughout the human and great ape
lineages, determining that the rate of gene loss has not been different in the
human branch compared to other internal branches in the great ape phylogeny. This
comprehensive catalogue of great ape genome diversity provides a framework for
understanding evolution and a resource for more effective management of wild and 
captive great ape populations.

A critical shortage of donor organs for treating end-stage organ failure
highlights the urgent need for generating organs from human induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs). Despite many reports describing functional cell
differentiation, no studies have succeeded in generating a three-dimensional
vascularized organ such as liver. Here we show the generation of vascularized and
functional human liver from human iPSCs by transplantation of liver buds created 
in vitro (iPSC-LBs). Specified hepatic cells (immature endodermal cells destined 
to track the hepatic cell fate) self-organized into three-dimensional iPSC-LBs by
recapitulating organogenetic interactions between endothelial and mesenchymal
cells. Immunostaining and gene-expression analyses revealed a resemblance between
in vitro grown iPSC-LBs and in vivo liver buds. Human vasculatures in iPSC-LB
transplants became functional by connecting to the host vessels within 48 hours. 
The formation of functional vasculatures stimulated the maturation of iPSC-LBs
into tissue resembling the adult liver. Highly metabolic iPSC-derived tissue
performed liver-specific functions such as protein production and human-specific 
drug metabolism without recipient liver replacement. Furthermore, mesenteric
transplantation of iPSC-LBs rescued the drug-induced lethal liver failure model. 
To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a
functional human organ from pluripotent stem cells. Although efforts must ensue
to translate these techniques to treatments for patients, this proof-of-concept
demonstration of organ-bud transplantation provides a promising new approach to
study regenerative medicine.

mTORC1 couples immune signals and metabolic programming to establish T(reg)-cell 
function.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway integrates diverse
environmental inputs, including immune signals and metabolic cues, to direct
T-cell fate decisions. The activation of mTOR, which is the catalytic subunit of 
the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, delivers an obligatory signal for the proper
activation and differentiation of effector CD4(+) T cells, whereas in the
regulatory T-cell (T(reg)) compartment, the Akt-mTOR axis is widely acknowledged 
as a crucial negative regulator of T(reg)-cell de novo differentiation and
population expansion. However, whether mTOR signalling affects the homeostasis
and function of T(reg) cells remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mTORC1
signalling is a pivotal positive determinant of T(reg)-cell function in mice.
T(reg) cells have elevated steady-state mTORC1 activity compared to naive T
cells. Signals through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)
provide major inputs for mTORC1 activation, which in turn programs the
suppressive function of T(reg) cells. Disruption of mTORC1 through Treg-specific 
deletion of the essential component raptor leads to a profound loss of
T(reg)-cell suppressive activity in vivo and the development of a fatal early
onset inflammatory disorder. Mechanistically, raptor/mTORC1 signalling in T(reg) 
cells promotes cholesterol and lipid metabolism, with the mevalonate pathway
particularly important for coordinating T(reg)-cell proliferation and
upregulation of the suppressive molecules CTLA4 and ICOS to establish Treg-cell
functional competency. By contrast, mTORC1 does not directly affect the
expression of Foxp3 or anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines in T(reg) cells,
suggesting a non-conventional mechanism for T(reg)-cell functional regulation.
Finally, we provide evidence that mTORC1 maintains T(reg)-cell function partly
through inhibiting the mTORC2 pathway. Our results demonstrate that mTORC1 acts
as a fundamental 'rheostat' in T(reg) cells to link immunological signals from
TCR and IL-2 to lipogenic pathways and functional fitness, and highlight a
central role of metabolic programming of T(reg)-cell suppressive activity in
immune homeostasis and tolerance.

Attention is a critical component of perception. However, the mechanisms by which
attention modulates neuronal communication to guide behaviour are poorly
understood. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of attention, we developed a
sensitive assay of attentional modulation of neuronal communication. In alert
monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical
communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate
nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses
from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that
attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of
presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous
responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input,
and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common
input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication
at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced
detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment.

Of the 132 people known to have been infected with H7N9 influenza viruses in
China, 37 died, and many were severely ill. Infection seems to have involved
contact with infected poultry. We have examined the receptor-binding properties
of this H7N9 virus and compared them with those of an avian H7N3 virus. We find
that the human H7 virus has significantly higher affinity for α-2,6-linked sialic
acid analogues ('human receptor') than avian H7 while retaining the strong
binding to α-2,3-linked sialic acid analogues ('avian receptor') characteristic
of avian viruses. The human H7 virus does not, therefore, have the preference for
human versus avian receptors characteristic of pandemic viruses. X-ray
crystallography of the receptor-binding protein, haemagglutinin (HA), in complex 
with receptor analogues indicates that both human and avian receptors adopt
different conformations when bound to human H7 HA than they do when bound to
avian H7 HA. Human receptor bound to human H7 HA exits the binding site in a
different direction to that seen in complexes formed by HAs from pandemic viruses
and from an aerosol-transmissible H5 mutant. The human-receptor-binding
properties of human H7 probably arise from the introduction of two bulky
hydrophobic residues by the substitutions Gln226Leu and Gly186Val. The former is 
shared with the 1957 H2 and 1968 H3 pandemic viruses and with the
aerosol-transmissible H5 mutant. We conclude that the human H7 virus has acquired
some of the receptor-binding characteristics that are typical of pandemic
viruses, but its retained preference for avian receptor may restrict its further 
evolution towards a virus that could transmit efficiently between humans, perhaps
by binding to avian-receptor-rich mucins in the human respiratory tract rather
than to cellular receptors.

Ratios of S, Se and Te in the silicate Earth require a volatile-rich late veneer.

The excess of highly siderophile (iron-loving) elements (HSEs) and the chondritic
ratios of most HSEs in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) may reflect the accretion of
a chondritic 'late veneer' of about 0.5 per cent of Earth's mass after core
formation. The amount of volatiles contained in the late veneer is a key
constraint on the budget and the origin of the volatiles in Earth. At high
pressures and temperatures, the moderately volatile chalcogen elements sulphur
(S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) are moderately to highly siderophile; thus,
if depleted by core formation their mantle abundances should reflect the volatile
composition of the late veneer. Here we report ratios and abundances of S, Se and
Te in the mantle determined from new isotope dilution data for post-Archaean
mantle peridotites. The mean S/Se and Se/Te ratios of mantle lherzolites overlap 
with CI (Ivuna-type) carbonaceous chondrite values. The Se/Te ratios of ordinary 
and enstatite chondrites are significantly different. The chalcogen/HSE ratio of 
the BSE is similar to that of CM (Mighei-type) carbonaceous chondrites,
consistent with the view that the HSE signature of the BSE reflects a
predominance of slightly volatile-depleted, carbonaceous-chondrite-like material,
possibly with a minor proportion of non-chondritic material. Depending on the
estimates for the abundances of water and carbon in the BSE, the late veneer may 
have supplied 20 to 100 per cent of the budget of hydrogen and carbon in the BSE.

SyrB2.

Mononuclear non-haem iron (NHFe) enzymes catalyse a broad range of oxidative
reactions, including halogenation, hydroxylation, ring closure, desaturation and 
aromatic ring cleavage reactions. They are involved in a number of biological
processes, including phenylalanine metabolism, the production of
neurotransmitters, the hypoxic response and the biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites. The reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycles of these enzymes
is a high-spin S = 2 Fe(IV)=O species, which has been trapped for a number of
NHFe enzymes, including the halogenase SyrB2 (syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme
2). Computational studies aimed at understanding the reactivity of this Fe(IV)=O 
intermediate are limited in applicability owing to the paucity of experimental
knowledge about its geometric and electronic structure. Synchrotron-based nuclear
resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) is a sensitive and effective method
that defines the dependence of the vibrational modes involving Fe on the nature
of the Fe(IV)=O active site. Here we present NRVS structural characterization of 
the reactive Fe(IV)=O intermediate of a NHFe enzyme, namely the halogenase SyrB2 
from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This intermediate reacts
via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction step, performing subsequent halogenation
of the native substrate or hydroxylation of non-native substrates. A correlation 
of the experimental NRVS data to electronic structure calculations indicates that
the substrate directs the orientation of the Fe(IV)=O intermediate, presenting
specific frontier molecular orbitals that can activate either selective
halogenation or hydroxylation.

The Josephson effect describes the flow of supercurrent in a weak link-such as a 
tunnel junction, nanowire or molecule-between two superconductors. It is the
basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from
medicine to quantum information. Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave
like artificial atoms are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the
laws of quantum physics. Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev 
pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets 
and have energies inside the superconducting gap. Existing Josephson circuits are
based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the
excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence
through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The
spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference
between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev
doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of
superconducting qubits.

Aberrant neovascularization contributes to diseases such as cancer, blindness and
atherosclerosis, and is the consequence of inappropriate angiogenic signalling.
Although many regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis have been identified, our
understanding of this process is incomplete. Here we explore the transcriptome of
retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal disease that exhibit
vascular pathology, and uncover an upregulated gene, leucine-rich
alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1), of previously unknown function. We show that in
the presence of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), LRG1 is mitogenic to
endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking Lrg1 develop a mild
retinal vascular phenotype but exhibit a significant reduction in pathological
ocular angiogenesis. LRG1 binds directly to the TGF-β accessory receptor
endoglin, which, in the presence of TGF-β1, results in promotion of the
pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. LRG1 antibody blockade inhibits this
switch and attenuates angiogenesis. These studies reveal a new regulator of
angiogenesis that mediates its effect by modulating TGF-β signalling.

Myomaker is a membrane activator of myoblast fusion and muscle formation.

Fusion of myoblasts is essential for the formation of multi-nucleated muscle
fibres. However, the identity of muscle-specific proteins that directly govern
this fusion process in mammals has remained elusive. Here we identify a
muscle-specific membrane protein, named myomaker, that controls myoblast fusion. 
Myomaker is expressed on the cell surface of myoblasts during fusion and is
downregulated thereafter. Overexpression of myomaker in myoblasts markedly
enhances fusion, and genetic disruption of myomaker in mice causes perinatal
death due to an absence of multi-nucleated muscle fibres. Remarkably, forced
expression of myomaker in fibroblasts promotes fusion with myoblasts,
demonstrating the direct participation of this protein in the fusion process.
Pharmacological perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton abolishes the activity of 
myomaker, consistent with previous studies implicating actin dynamics in myoblast
fusion. These findings reveal a long-sought myogenic fusion protein that controls
mammalian myoblast fusion and provide new insights into the molecular
underpinnings of muscle formation.

Fluorescent calcium sensors are widely used to image neural activity. Using
structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of 
ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors
in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3
pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single
action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium
transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally
persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning
averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell.
Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their 
dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors
thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits
over multiple spatial and temporal scales.

Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) differs from most other salmonellae 
in that it causes a life-threatening systemic infection known as typhoid fever.
The molecular bases for its unique clinical presentation are unknown. Here we
find that the systemic administration of typhoid toxin, a unique virulence factor
of S. Typhi, reproduces many of the acute symptoms of typhoid fever in an animal 
model. We identify specific carbohydrate moieties on specific surface
glycoproteins that serve as receptors for typhoid toxin, which explains its broad
cell target specificity. We present the atomic structure of typhoid toxin, which 
shows an unprecedented A2B5 organization with two covalently linked A subunits
non-covalently associated to a pentameric B subunit. The structure provides
insight into the toxin's receptor-binding specificity and delivery mechanisms and
reveals how the activities of two powerful toxins have been co-opted into a
single, unique toxin that can induce many of the symptoms characteristic of
typhoid fever. These findings may lead to the development of potentially
life-saving therapeutics against typhoid fever.

Terrestrial plants remove CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, a
process that is accompanied by the loss of water vapour from leaves. The ratio of
water loss to carbon gain, or water-use efficiency, is a key characteristic of
ecosystem function that is central to the global cycles of water, energy and
carbon. Here we analyse direct, long-term measurements of whole-ecosystem carbon 
and water exchange. We find a substantial increase in water-use efficiency in
temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere over the past two
decades. We systematically assess various competing hypotheses to explain this
trend, and find that the observed increase is most consistent with a strong CO2
fertilization effect. The results suggest a partial closure of stomata-small
pores on the leaf surface that regulate gas exchange-to maintain a near-constant 
concentration of CO2 inside the leaf even under continually increasing
atmospheric CO2 levels. The observed increase in forest water-use efficiency is
larger than that predicted by existing theory and 13 terrestrial biosphere
models. The increase is associated with trends of increasing ecosystem-level
photosynthesis and net carbon uptake, and decreasing evapotranspiration. Our
findings suggest a shift in the carbon- and water-based economics of terrestrial 
vegetation, which may require a reassessment of the role of stomatal control in
regulating interactions between forests and climate change, and a re-evaluation
of coupled vegetation-climate models.

Riboswitches are cis-acting gene-regulatory RNA elements that can function at the
level of transcription, translation and RNA cleavage. The commonly accepted
molecular mechanism for riboswitch function proposes a ligand-dependent
conformational switch between two mutually exclusive states. According to this
mechanism, ligand binding to an aptamer domain induces an allosteric
conformational switch of an expression platform, leading to activation or
repression of ligand-related gene expression. However, many riboswitch properties
cannot be explained by a pure two-state mechanism. Here we show that the
regulation mechanism of the adenine-sensing riboswitch, encoded by the add gene
on chromosome II of the human Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium Vibrio
vulnificus, is notably different from a two-state switch mechanism in that it
involves three distinct stable conformations. We characterized the temperature
and Mg(2+) dependence of the population ratios of the three conformations and the
kinetics of their interconversion at nucleotide resolution. The observed
temperature dependence of a pre-equilibrium involving two structurally distinct
ligand-free conformations of the add riboswitch conferred efficient regulation
over a physiologically relevant temperature range. Such robust switching is a key
requirement for gene regulation in bacteria that have to adapt to environments
with varying temperatures. The translational adenine-sensing riboswitch
represents the first example, to our knowledge, of a temperature-compensated
regulatory RNA element.

Sequential deposition as a route to high-performance perovskite-sensitized solar

Following pioneering work, solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid
perovskites-such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)-have attracted attention as
light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic solar cells. So far, the perovskite
pigment has been deposited in a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films
using a mixture of PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent. However, the
uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological
variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the
resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for practical applications. Here
we describe a sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite
pigment within the porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first introduced from
solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently transformed
into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of CH3NH3I. We find that the
conversion occurs within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come
into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite morphology than 
is possible with the previously employed route. Using this technique for the
fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the
reproducibility of their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion 
efficiency of approximately 15 per cent (measured under standard AM1.5G test
conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature).
This two-step method should provide new opportunities for the fabrication of
solution-processed photovoltaic cells with unprecedented power conversion
efficiencies and high stability equal to or even greater than those of today's
best thin-film photovoltaic devices.

Transcription of the mammalian genome is pervasive, but productive transcription 
outside of protein-coding genes is limited by unknown mechanisms. In particular, 
although RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) initiates divergently from most active gene
promoters, productive elongation occurs primarily in the sense-coding direction. 
Here we show in mouse embryonic stem cells that asymmetric sequence determinants 
flanking gene transcription start sites control promoter directionality by
regulating promoter-proximal cleavage and polyadenylation. We find that upstream 
antisense RNAs are cleaved and polyadenylated at poly(A) sites (PASs) shortly
after initiation. De novo motif analysis shows PAS signals and U1 small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) recognition sites to be the most depleted and enriched 
sequences, respectively, in the sense direction relative to the upstream
antisense direction. These U1 snRNP sites and PAS sites are progressively gained 
and lost, respectively, at the 5' end of coding genes during vertebrate
evolution. Functional disruption of U1 snRNP activity results in a dramatic
increase in promoter-proximal cleavage events in the sense direction with slight 
increases in the antisense direction. These data suggest that a U1-PAS axis
characterized by low U1 snRNP recognition and a high density of PASs in the
upstream antisense region reinforces promoter directionality by promoting early
termination in upstream antisense regions, whereas proximal sense PAS signals are
suppressed by U1 snRNP. We propose that the U1-PAS axis limits pervasive
transcription throughout the genome.

Although transitions of sex-determination mechanisms are frequent in species with
homomorphic sex chromosomes, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are thought to
represent a terminal evolutionary stage owing to chromosome-specific adaptations 
such as dosage compensation or an accumulation of sex-specific mutations. Here we
show that an autosome of Drosophila, the dot chromosome, was ancestrally a
differentiated X chromosome. We analyse the whole genome of true fruitflies
(Tephritidae), flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) and soldier flies (Stratiomyidae) to
show that genes located on the dot chromosome of Drosophila are X-linked in
outgroup species, whereas Drosophila X-linked genes are autosomal. We date this
chromosomal transition to early drosophilid evolution by sequencing the genome of
other Drosophilidae. Our results reveal several puzzling aspects of Drosophila
dot chromosome biology to be possible remnants of its former life as a sex
chromosome, such as its minor feminizing role in sex determination or its
targeting by a chromosome-specific regulatory mechanism. We also show that
patterns of biased gene expression of the dot chromosome during early
embryogenesis, oogenesis and spermatogenesis resemble that of the current X
chromosome. Thus, although sex chromosomes are not necessarily evolutionary end
points and can revert back to an autosomal inheritance, the highly specialized
genome architecture of this former X chromosome suggests that severe fitness
costs must be overcome for such a turnover to occur.

cortex.

In the mammalian neocortex, segregated processing streams are thought to be
important for forming sensory representations of the environment, but how local
information in primary sensory cortex is transmitted to other distant cortical
areas during behaviour is unclear. Here we show task-dependent activation of
distinct, largely non-overlapping long-range projection neurons in the whisker
region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in awake, behaving mice. Using
two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored neuronal activity in anatomically
identified S1 neurons projecting to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor
(M1) cortex in mice using their whiskers to perform a texture-discrimination task
or a task that required them to detect the presence of an object at a certain
location. Whisking-related cells were found among S2-projecting (S2P) but not
M1-projecting (M1P) neurons. A higher fraction of S2P than M1P neurons showed
touch-related responses during texture discrimination, whereas a higher fraction 
of M1P than S2P neurons showed touch-related responses during the detection task.
In both tasks, S2P and M1P neurons could discriminate similarly between trials
producing different behavioural decisions. However, in trials producing the same 
decision, S2P neurons performed better at discriminating texture, whereas M1P
neurons were better at discriminating location. Sensory stimulus features alone
were not sufficient to elicit these differences, suggesting that selective
transmission of S1 information to S2 and M1 is driven by behaviour.

    Nat Rev Cancer. 2013 Aug;13(8):522.

The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) displays exceptional longevity, with a
maximum lifespan exceeding 30 years. This is the longest reported lifespan for a 
rodent species and is especially striking considering the small body mass of the 
naked mole rat. In comparison, a similarly sized house mouse has a maximum
lifespan of 4 years. In addition to their longevity, naked mole rats show an
unusual resistance to cancer. Multi-year observations of large naked mole-rat
colonies did not detect a single incidence of cancer. Here we identify a
mechanism responsible for the naked mole rat's cancer resistance. We found that
naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan (HA),
which is over five times larger than human or mouse HA. This high-molecular-mass 
HA accumulates abundantly in naked mole-rat tissues owing to the decreased
activity of HA-degrading enzymes and a unique sequence of hyaluronan synthase 2
(HAS2). Furthermore, the naked mole-rat cells are more sensitive to HA
signalling, as they have a higher affinity to HA compared with mouse or human
cells. Perturbation of the signalling pathways sufficient for malignant
transformation of mouse fibroblasts fails to transform naked mole-rat cells.
However, once high-molecular-mass HA is removed by either knocking down HAS2 or
overexpressing the HA-degrading enzyme, HYAL2, naked mole-rat cells become
susceptible to malignant transformation and readily form tumours in mice. We
speculate that naked mole rats have evolved a higher concentration of HA in the
skin to provide skin elasticity needed for life in underground tunnels. This
trait may have then been co-opted to provide cancer resistance and longevity to
this species.

Activity-dependent phosphorylation of MeCP2 threonine 308 regulates interaction
with NCoR.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked human neurodevelopmental disorder with
features of autism and severe neurological dysfunction in females. RTT is caused 
by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein that, in 
neurons, regulates transcription, is expressed at high levels similar to that of 
histones, and binds to methylated cytosines broadly across the genome. By
phosphotryptic mapping, we identify three sites (S86, S274 and T308) of
activity-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of these sites is
differentially induced by neuronal activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
or agents that elevate the intracellular level of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP),
indicating that MeCP2 may function as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression 
that integrates diverse signals from the environment. Here we show that the
phosphorylation of T308 blocks the interaction of the repressor domain of MeCP2
with the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) complex and suppresses the ability 
of MeCP2 to repress transcription. In knock-in mice bearing the common human RTT 
missense mutation R306C, neuronal activity fails to induce MeCP2 T308
phosphorylation, suggesting that the loss of T308 phosphorylation might
contribute to RTT. Consistent with this possibility, the mutation of MeCP2 T308A 
in mice leads to a decrease in the induction of a subset of activity-regulated
genes and to RTT-like symptoms. These findings indicate that the
activity-dependent phosphorylation of MeCP2 at T308 regulates the interaction of 
MeCP2 with the NCoR complex, and that RTT in humans may be due, in part, to the
loss of activity-dependent MeCP2 T308 phosphorylation and a disruption of the
phosphorylation-regulated interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR complex.

Carbon catabolite repression of the maltose transporter revealed by X-ray
crystallography.

Efficient carbon utilization is critical to the survival of microorganisms in
competitive environments. To optimize energy usage, bacteria have developed an
integrated control system to preferentially uptake carbohydrates that support
rapid growth. The availability of a preferred carbon source, such as glucose,
represses the synthesis and activities of proteins necessary for the transport
and metabolism of secondary carbon sources. This regulatory phenomenon is defined
as carbon catabolite repression. In enteric bacteria, the key player of carbon
catabolite repression is a component of the glucose-specific phosphotransferase
system, enzyme IIA (EIIA(Glc)). It is known that unphosphorylated EIIA(Glc) binds
to and inhibits a variety of transporters when glucose is available. However,
understanding the underlying molecular mechanism has been hindered by the
complete absence of structures for any EIIA(Glc)-transporter complexes. Here we
present the 3.9 Å crystal structure of Escherichia coli EIIA(Glc) in complex with
the maltose transporter, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The structure
shows that two EIIA(Glc) molecules bind to the cytoplasmic ATPase subunits,
stabilizing the transporter in an inward-facing conformation and preventing the
structural rearrangements necessary for ATP hydrolysis. We also show that the
half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of the full-length EIIA(Glc) and an
amino-terminal truncation mutant differ by 60-fold, consistent with the
hypothesis that the amino-terminal region, disordered in the crystal structure,
functions as a membrane anchor to increase the effective EIIA(Glc) concentration 
at the membrane. Together these data suggest a model of how the central
regulatory protein EIIA(Glc) allosterically inhibits maltose uptake in E. coli.

Characterization and implications of intradecadal variations in length of day.

UK. holme@liv.ac.uk

Variations in Earth's rotation (defined in terms of length of day) arise from
external tidal torques, or from an exchange of angular momentum between the solid
Earth and its fluid components. On short timescales (annual or shorter) the
non-tidal component is dominated by the atmosphere, with small contributions from
the ocean and hydrological system. On decadal timescales, the dominant
contribution is from angular momentum exchange between the solid mantle and fluid
outer core. Intradecadal periods have been less clear and have been characterized
by signals with a wide range of periods and varying amplitudes, including a peak 
at about 6 years (refs 2-4). Here, by working in the time domain rather than the 
frequency domain, we show a clear partition of the non-atmospheric component into
only three components: a decadally varying trend, a 5.9-year period oscillation, 
and jumps at times contemporaneous with geomagnetic jerks. The nature of the
jumps in length of day leads to a fundamental change in what class of phenomena
may give rise to the jerks, and provides a strong constraint on electrical
conductivity of the lower mantle, which can in turn constrain its structure and
composition.

Metal-free oxidation of aromatic carbon-hydrogen bonds through a reverse-rebound 
mechanism.

Methods for carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond oxidation have a fundamental role in
synthetic organic chemistry, providing functionality that is required in the
final target molecule or facilitating subsequent chemical transformations.
Several approaches to oxidizing aliphatic C-H bonds have been described,
drastically simplifying the synthesis of complex molecules. However, the
selective oxidation of aromatic C-H bonds under mild conditions, especially in
the context of substituted arenes with diverse functional groups, remains a
challenge. The direct hydroxylation of arenes was initially achieved through the 
use of strong Brønsted or Lewis acids to mediate electrophilic aromatic
substitution reactions with super-stoichiometric equivalents of oxidants,
significantly limiting the scope of the reaction. Because the products of these
reactions are more reactive than the starting materials, over-oxidation is
frequently a competitive process. Transition-metal-catalysed C-H oxidation of
arenes with or without directing groups has been developed, improving on the
acid-mediated process; however, precious metals are required. Here we demonstrate
that phthaloyl peroxide functions as a selective oxidant for the transformation
of arenes to phenols under mild conditions. Although the reaction proceeds
through a radical mechanism, aromatic C-H bonds are selectively oxidized in
preference to activated Csp3-H bonds. Notably, a wide array of functional groups 
are compatible with this reaction, and this method is therefore well suited for
late-stage transformations of advanced synthetic intermediates. Quantum
mechanical calculations indicate that this transformation proceeds through a
novel addition-abstraction mechanism, a kind of 'reverse-rebound' mechanism as
distinct from the common oxygen-rebound mechanism observed for metal-oxo
oxidants. These calculations also identify the origins of the experimentally
observed aryl selectivity.

The ability to confine light is important both scientifically and
technologically. Many light confinement methods exist, but they all achieve
confinement with materials or systems that forbid outgoing waves. These systems
can be implemented by metallic mirrors, by photonic band-gap materials, by highly
disordered media (Anderson localization) and, for a subset of outgoing waves, by 
translational symmetry (total internal reflection) or by rotational or reflection
symmetry. Exceptions to these examples exist only in theoretical proposals. Here 
we predict and show experimentally that light can be perfectly confined in a
patterned dielectric slab, even though outgoing waves are allowed in the
surrounding medium. Technically, this is an observation of an 'embedded
eigenvalue'--namely, a bound state in a continuum of radiation modes--that is not
due to symmetry incompatibility. Such a bound state can exist stably in a general
class of geometries in which all of its radiation amplitudes vanish
simultaneously as a result of destructive interference. This method to trap
electromagnetic waves is also applicable to electronic and mechanical waves.

'Debris disks' around young stars (analogues of the Kuiper Belt in our Solar
System) show a variety of non-trivial structures attributed to planetary
perturbations and used to constrain the properties of those planets. However,
these analyses have largely ignored the fact that some debris disks are found to 
contain small quantities of gas, a component that all such disks should contain
at some level. Several debris disks have been measured with a dust-to-gas ratio
of about unity, at which the effect of hydrodynamics on the structure of the disk
cannot be ignored. Here we report linear and nonlinear modelling that shows that 
dust-gas interactions can produce some of the key patterns attributed to planets.
We find a robust clumping instability that organizes the dust into narrow,
eccentric rings, similar to the Fomalhaut debris disk. The conclusion that such
disks might contain planets is not necessarily required to explain these systems.

RNA-binding proteins are key regulators of gene expression, yet only a small
fraction have been functionally characterized. Here we report a systematic
analysis of the RNA motifs recognized by RNA-binding proteins, encompassing 205
distinct genes from 24 diverse eukaryotes. The sequence specificities of
RNA-binding proteins display deep evolutionary conservation, and the recognition 
preferences for a large fraction of metazoan RNA-binding proteins can thus be
inferred from their RNA-binding domain sequence. The motifs that we identify in
vitro correlate well with in vivo RNA-binding data. Moreover, we can associate
them with distinct functional roles in diverse types of post-transcriptional
regulation, enabling new insights into the functions of RNA-binding proteins both
in normal physiology and in human disease. These data provide an unprecedented
overview of RNA-binding proteins and their targets, and constitute an invaluable 
resource for determining post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in
eukaryotes.

Cell-surface receptors frequently use scaffold proteins to recruit cytoplasmic
targets, but the rationale for this is uncertain. Activated receptor tyrosine
kinases, for example, engage scaffolds such as Shc1 that contain phosphotyrosine 
(pTyr)-binding (PTB) domains. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, here we show 
that mammalian Shc1 responds to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation through
multiple waves of distinct phosphorylation events and protein interactions. After
stimulation, Shc1 rapidly binds a group of proteins that activate pro-mitogenic
or survival pathways dependent on recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor to Shc1 pTyr
sites. Akt-mediated feedback phosphorylation of Shc1 Ser 29 then recruits the
Ptpn12 tyrosine phosphatase. This is followed by a sub-network of proteins
involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, trafficking and signal termination that 
binds Shc1 with delayed kinetics, largely through the SgK269 pseudokinase/adaptor
protein. Ptpn12 acts as a switch to convert Shc1 from pTyr/Grb2-based signalling 
to SgK269-mediated pathways that regulate cell invasion and morphogenesis. The
Shc1 scaffold therefore directs the temporal flow of signalling information after
EGF stimulation.

Shor's quantum factoring algorithm exponentially outperforms known classical
methods. Previous experimental implementations have used simplifications
dependent on knowing the factors in advance. However, as we show here, all
composite numbers admit simplification of the algorithm to a circuit equivalent
to flipping coins. The difficulty of a particular experiment therefore depends on
the level of simplification chosen, not the size of the number factored. Valid
implementations should not make use of the answer sought.

Climate targets are designed to inform policies that would limit the magnitude
and impacts of climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases and other substances. The target that is currently recognized by most world
governments places a limit of two degrees Celsius on the global mean warming
since preindustrial times. This would require large sustained reductions in
carbon dioxide emissions during the twenty-first century and beyond. Such a
global temperature target, however, is not sufficient to control many other
quantities, such as transient sea level rise, ocean acidification and net primary
production on land. Here, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity 
(EMIC) in an observation-informed Bayesian approach, we show that allowable
carbon emissions are substantially reduced when multiple climate targets are set.
We take into account uncertainties in physical and carbon cycle model parameters,
radiative efficiencies, climate sensitivity and carbon cycle feedbacks along with
a large set of observational constraints. Within this framework, we explore a
broad range of economically feasible greenhouse gas scenarios from the integrated
assessment community to determine the likelihood of meeting a combination of
specific global and regional targets under various assumptions. For any given
likelihood of meeting a set of such targets, the allowable cumulative emissions
are greatly reduced from those inferred from the temperature target alone.
Therefore, temperature targets alone are unable to comprehensively limit the
risks from anthropogenic emissions.

We have taken the first steps towards a complete reconstruction of the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulatory network based on ChIP-Seq and combined this
reconstruction with system-wide profiling of messenger RNAs, proteins,
metabolites and lipids during hypoxia and re-aeration. Adaptations to hypoxia are
thought to have a prominent role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Using ChIP-Seq 
combined with expression data from the induction of the same factors, we have
reconstructed a draft regulatory network based on 50 transcription factors. This 
network model revealed a direct interconnection between the hypoxic response,
lipid catabolism, lipid anabolism and the production of cell wall lipids. As a
validation of this model, in response to oxygen availability we observe
substantial alterations in lipid content and changes in gene expression and
metabolites in corresponding metabolic pathways. The regulatory network reveals
transcription factors underlying these changes, allows us to computationally
predict expression changes, and indicates that Rv0081 is a regulatory hub.

Phosphoinositides serve crucial roles in cell physiology, ranging from cell
signalling to membrane traffic. Among the seven eukaryotic phosphoinositides the 
best studied species is phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which 
is concentrated at the plasma membrane where, among other functions, it is
required for the nucleation of endocytic clathrin-coated pits. No
phosphatidylinositol other than PI(4,5)P2 has been implicated in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis, whereas the subsequent endosomal stages of the
endocytic pathway are dominated by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphates(PI(3)P). How
phosphatidylinositol conversion from PI(4,5)P2-positive endocytic intermediates
to PI(3)P-containing endosomes is achieved is unclear. Here we show that
formation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) by class II
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase C2α (PI(3)K C2α) spatiotemporally controls
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Depletion of PI(3,4)P2 or PI(3)K C2α impairs the
maturation of late-stage clathrin-coated pits before fission. Timed formation of 
PI(3,4)P2 by PI(3)K C2α is required for selective enrichment of the BAR domain
protein SNX9 at late-stage endocytic intermediates. These findings provide a
mechanistic framework for the role of PI(3,4)P2 in endocytosis and unravel a
novel discrete function of PI(3,4)P2 in a central cell physiological process.

The variant antigen Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(PfEMP1), which is expressed on the surface of P. falciparum-infected red blood
cells, is a critical virulence factor for malaria. Each parasite has 60
antigenically distinct var genes that each code for a different PfEMP1 protein.
During infection the clonal parasite population expresses only one gene at a time
before switching to the expression of a new variant antigen as an immune-evasion 
mechanism to avoid the host antibody response. The mechanism by which 59 of the
60 var genes are silenced remains largely unknown. Here we show that knocking out
the P. falciparum variant-silencing SET gene (here termed PfSETvs), which encodes
an orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster ASH1 and controls histone H3 lysine 36
trimethylation (H3K36me3) on var genes, results in the transcription of virtually
all var genes in the single parasite nuclei and their expression as proteins on
the surface of individual infected red blood cells. PfSETvs-dependent H3K36me3 is
present along the entire gene body, including the transcription start site, to
silence var genes. With low occupancy of PfSETvs at both the transcription start 
site of var genes and the intronic promoter, expression of var genes coincides
with transcription of their corresponding antisense long noncoding RNA. These
results uncover a previously unknown role of PfSETvs-dependent H3K36me3 in
silencing var genes in P. falciparum that might provide a general mechanism by
which orthologues of PfSETvs repress gene expression in other eukaryotes. PfSETvs
knockout parasites expressing all PfEMP1 proteins may also be applied to the
development of a malaria vaccine.

The STIM1-ORAI1 pathway of store-operated Ca(2+) entry is an essential component 
of cellular Ca(2+) signalling. STIM1 senses depletion of intracellular Ca(2+)
stores in response to physiological stimuli, and relocalizes within the
endoplasmic reticulum to plasma-membrane-apposed junctions, where it recruits and
gates open plasma membrane ORAI1 Ca(2+) channels. Here we use a genome-wide RNA
interference screen in HeLa cells to identify filamentous septin proteins as
crucial regulators of store-operated Ca(2+) entry. Septin filaments and
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (also known as PtdIns(4,5)P2) rearrange
locally at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane junctions before and during
formation of STIM1-ORAI1 clusters, facilitating STIM1 targeting to these
junctions and promoting the stable recruitment of ORAI1. Septin rearrangement at 
junctions is required for PtdIns(4,5)P2 reorganization and efficient STIM1-ORAI1 
communication. Septins are known to demarcate specialized membrane regions such
as dendritic spines, the yeast bud and the primary cilium, and to serve as
membrane diffusion barriers and/or signalling hubs in cellular processes such as 
vesicle trafficking, cell polarity and cytokinesis. Our data show that septins
also organize the highly localized plasma membrane domains that are important in 
STIM1-ORAI1 signalling, and indicate that septins may organize membrane
microdomains relevant to other signalling processes.

Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a
comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and
progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched
tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes
in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we 
describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size
increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current
analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible
genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), 
suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. 
We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide
a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply
MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover
extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types,
which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation 
frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication
timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational
heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the
apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly
associated with cancer.

Scientific ocean drilling has revealed a deep biosphere of widespread microbial
life in sub-seafloor sediment. Microbial metabolism in the marine subsurface
probably has an important role in global biogeochemical cycles, but deep
biosphere activities are not well understood. Here we describe and analyse the
first sub-seafloor metatranscriptomes from anaerobic Peru Margin sediment up to
159 metres below the sea floor, represented by over 1 billion complementary DNA
(cDNA) sequence reads. Anaerobic metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and
lipids seem to be the dominant metabolic processes, and profiles of dissimilatory
sulfite reductase (dsr) transcripts are consistent with pore-water sulphate
concentration profiles. Moreover, transcripts involved in cell division increase 
as a function of microbial cell concentration, indicating that increases in
sub-seafloor microbial abundance are a function of cell division across all three
domains of life. These data support calculations and models of sub-seafloor
microbial metabolism and represent the first holistic picture of deep biosphere
activities.

The tips of mammalian digits can regenerate after amputation, like those of
amphibians. It is unknown why this capacity is limited to the area associated
with the nail. Here we show that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside in the proximal
nail matrix and that the mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are coupled
directly with their ability to orchestrate digit regeneration. Early nail
progenitors undergo Wnt-dependent differentiation into the nail. After
amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and also for
attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth, leading to the
regeneration of the digit. Amputations proximal to the Wnt-active nail
progenitors result in failure to regenerate the nail or digit. Nevertheless,
β-catenin stabilization in the NSC region induced their regeneration. These
results establish a link between NSC differentiation and digit regeneration, and 
suggest that NSCs may have the potential to contribute to the development of
novel treatments for amputees.

Coccolithophores have influenced the global climate for over 200 million years.
These marine phytoplankton can account for 20 per cent of total carbon fixation
in some systems. They form blooms that can occupy hundreds of thousands of square
kilometres and are distinguished by their elegantly sculpted calcium carbonate
exoskeletons (coccoliths), rendering them visible from space. Although
coccolithophores export carbon in the form of organic matter and calcite to the
sea floor, they also release CO2 in the calcification process. Hence, they have a
complex influence on the carbon cycle, driving either CO2 production or uptake,
sequestration and export to the deep ocean. Here we report the first haptophyte
reference genome, from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain CCMP1516, and
sequences from 13 additional isolates. Our analyses reveal a pan genome (core
genes plus genes distributed variably between strains) probably supported by an
atypical complement of repetitive sequence in the genome. Comparisons across
strains demonstrate that E. huxleyi, which has long been considered a single
species, harbours extensive genome variability reflected in different metabolic
repertoires. Genome variability within this species complex seems to underpin its
capacity both to thrive in habitats ranging from the equator to the subarctic and
to form large-scale episodic blooms under a wide variety of environmental
conditions.

The mammalian gut ecosystem has considerable influence on host physiology, but
the mechanisms that sustain this complex environment in the face of different
stresses remain obscure. Perturbations to the gut ecosystem, such as through
antibiotic treatment or diet, are at present interpreted at the level of
bacterial phylogeny. Less is known about the contributions of the abundant
population of phages to this ecological network. Here we explore the phageome as 
a potential genetic reservoir for bacterial adaptation by sequencing murine
faecal phage populations following antibiotic perturbation. We show that
antibiotic treatment leads to the enrichment of phage-encoded genes that confer
resistance via disparate mechanisms to the administered drug, as well as genes
that confer resistance to antibiotics unrelated to the administered drug, and we 
demonstrate experimentally that phages from treated mice provide aerobically
cultured naive microbiota with increased resistance. Systems-wide analyses
uncovered post-treatment phage-encoded processes related to host colonization and
growth adaptation, indicating that the phageome becomes broadly enriched for
functionally beneficial genes under stress-related conditions. We also show that 
antibiotic treatment expands the interactions between phage and bacterial
species, leading to a more highly connected phage-bacterial network for gene
exchange. Our work implicates the phageome in the emergence of multidrug
resistance, and indicates that the adaptive capacity of the phageome may
represent a community-based mechanism for protecting the gut microflora,
preserving its functional robustness during antibiotic stress.

Investigations of a variety of continental rifts and margins worldwide have
revealed that a considerable volume of melt can intrude into the crust during
continental breakup, modifying its composition and thermal structure. However, it
is unclear whether the cause of voluminous melt production at volcanic rifts is
primarily increased mantle temperature or plate thinning. Also disputed is the
extent to which plate stretching or thinning is uniform or varies with depth with
the entire continental lithospheric mantle potentially being removed before plate
rupture. Here we show that the extensive magmatism during rifting along the
southern Red Sea rift in Afar, a unique region of sub-aerial transition from
continental to oceanic rifting, is driven by deep melting of hotter-than-normal
asthenosphere. Petrogenetic modelling shows that melts are predominantly
generated at depths greater than 80 kilometres, implying the existence of a thick
upper thermo-mechanical boundary layer in a rift system approaching the point of 
plate rupture. Numerical modelling of rift development shows that when breakup
occurs at the slow extension rates observed in Afar, the survival of a thick
plate is an inevitable consequence of conductive cooling of the lithosphere, even
when the underlying asthenosphere is hot. Sustained magmatic activity during
rifting in Afar thus requires persistently high mantle temperatures, which would 
allow melting at high pressure beneath the thick plate. If extensive plate
thinning does occur during breakup it must do so abruptly at a late stage,
immediately before the formation of the new ocean basin.

Quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic vacuum are responsible for physical
effects such as the Casimir force and the radiative decay of atoms, and set
fundamental limits on the sensitivity of measurements. Entanglement between
photons can produce correlations that result in a reduction of these fluctuations
below the ordinary vacuum level, allowing measurements that surpass the standard 
quantum limit in sensitivity. The effects of such 'squeezed states' of light on
matter were first considered in a prediction of the radiative decay rates of
atoms in squeezed vacuum. Despite efforts to demonstrate such effects in
experiments with natural atoms, a direct quantitative observation of this
prediction has remained elusive. Here we report a twofold reduction of the
transverse radiative decay rate of a superconducting artificial atom coupled to
continuum squeezed vacuum. The artificial atom is effectively a two-level system 
formed by the strong interaction between a superconducting circuit and a
microwave-frequency cavity. A Josephson parametric amplifier is used to generate 
quadrature-squeezed electromagnetic vacuum. The observed twofold reduction in the
decay rate of the atom allows the transverse coherence time, T2, to exceed the
ordinary vacuum decay limit, 2T1. We demonstrate that the measured radiative
decay dynamics can be used to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of the
itinerant squeezed state. Our results confirm a canonical prediction of quantum
optics and should enable new studies of the quantum light-matter interaction.

Global resurfacing of Mercury 4.0-4.1 billion years ago by heavy bombardment and 
volcanism.

The most heavily cratered terrains on Mercury have been estimated to be about 4
billion years (Gyr) old, but this was based on images of only about 45 per cent
of the surface; even older regions could have existed in the unobserved portion. 
These terrains have a lower density of craters less than 100 km in diameter than 
does the Moon, an observation attributed to preferential resurfacing on Mercury. 
Here we report global crater statistics of Mercury's most heavily cratered
terrains on the entire surface. Applying a recent model for early lunar crater
chronology and an updated dynamical extrapolation to Mercury, we find that the
oldest surfaces were emplaced just after the start of the Late Heavy Bombardment 
(LHB) about 4.0-4.1 Gyr ago. Mercury's global record of large impact basins,
which has hitherto not been dated, yields a similar surface age. This agreement
implies that resurfacing was global and was due to volcanism, as previously
suggested. This activity ended during the tail of the LHB, within about 300-400
million years after the emplacement of the oldest terrains on Mercury. These
findings suggest that persistent volcanism could have been aided by the surge of 
basin-scale impacts during this bombardment.

Hydrogenases are the most active molecular catalysts for hydrogen production and 
uptake, and could therefore facilitate the development of new types of fuel cell.
In [FeFe]-hydrogenases, catalysis takes place at a unique di-iron centre (the
[2Fe] subsite), which contains a bridging dithiolate ligand, three CO ligands and
two CN(-) ligands. Through a complex multienzymatic biosynthetic process, this
[2Fe] subsite is first assembled on a maturation enzyme, HydF, and then delivered
to the apo-hydrogenase for activation. Synthetic chemistry has been used to
prepare remarkably similar mimics of that subsite, but it has failed to reproduce
the natural enzymatic activities thus far. Here we show that three synthetic
mimics (containing different bridging dithiolate ligands) can be loaded onto
bacterial Thermotoga maritima HydF and then transferred to apo-HydA1, one of the 
hydrogenases of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae. Full activation of HydA1 was
achieved only when using the HydF hybrid protein containing the mimic with an
azadithiolate bridge, confirming the presence of this ligand in the active site
of native [FeFe]-hydrogenases. This is an example of controlled metalloenzyme
activation using the combination of a specific protein scaffold and active-site
synthetic analogues. This simple methodology provides both new mechanistic and
structural insight into hydrogenase maturation and a unique tool for producing
recombinant wild-type and variant [FeFe]-hydrogenases, with no requirement for
the complete maturation machinery.

The rich fossil record of equids has made them a model for evolutionary
processes. Here we present a 1.12-times coverage draft genome from a horse bone
recovered from permafrost dated to approximately 560-780 thousand years before
present (kyr BP). Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined
so far by almost an order of magnitude. For comparison, we sequenced the genome
of a Late Pleistocene horse (43 kyr BP), and modern genomes of five domestic
horse breeds (Equus ferus caballus), a Przewalski's horse (E. f. przewalskii) and
a donkey (E. asinus). Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to 
all contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5 million years
before present (Myr BP), twice the conventionally accepted time to the most
recent common ancestor of the genus Equus. We also find that horse population
size fluctuated multiple times over the past 2 Myr, particularly during periods
of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and domestic horse 
populations diverged 38-72 kyr BP, and find no evidence of recent admixture
between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski's horse investigated. This
supports the contention that Przewalski's horses represent the last surviving
wild horse population. We find similar levels of genetic variation among
Przewalski's and domestic populations, indicating that the former are genetically
viable and worthy of conservation efforts. We also find evidence for continuous
selection on the immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally,
we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate from neutrality
and show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski's horse. Such
regions could correspond to loci selected early during domestication.

Most stars and their planets form in open clusters. Over 95 per cent of such
clusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubic
parsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apart
within a few hundred million years. Older open clusters have survived by virtue
of being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) when they 
formed. Such clusters represent a stellar environment very different from the
birthplace of the Sun and other planet-hosting field stars. So far more than 800 
planets have been found around Sun-like stars in the field. The field planets are
usually the size of Neptune or smaller. In contrast, only four planets have been 
found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with masses similar to or greater than
that of Jupiter. Here we report observations of the transits of two Sun-like
stars by planets smaller than Neptune in the billion-year-old open cluster
NGC6811. This demonstrates that small planets can form and survive in a dense
cluster environment, and implies that the frequency and properties of planets in 
open clusters are consistent with those of planets around field stars in the
Galaxy.

Obesity has become more prevalent in most developed countries over the past few
decades, and is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for several common
types of cancer. As the worldwide obesity epidemic has shown no signs of abating,
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated cancer is
urgently needed. Although several events were proposed to be involved in
obesity-associated cancer, the exact molecular mechanisms that integrate these
events have remained largely unclear. Here we show that senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) has crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity
induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of
deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut bacterial metabolite known to cause DNA damage. The
enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs), which in turn secretes various inflammatory and tumour-promoting
factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to
chemical carcinogen. Notably, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria
efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also
observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs,
indicating that the DCA-SASP axis in HSCs has key roles in obesity-associated HCC
development. Moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area
of HCC arising in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, indicating that a 
similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated 
HCC development in humans as well. These findings provide valuable new insights
into the development of obesity-associated cancer and open up new possibilities
for its control.

Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include
alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and
the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than
400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly
mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this
pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was
associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative
analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling
complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other
pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift,
involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and
PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the
glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and
altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10.
Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC
that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the
opportunities for disease treatment.

53BP1 (also called TP53BP1) is a chromatin-associated factor that promotes
immunoglobulin class switching and DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair by
non-homologous end joining. To accomplish its function in DNA repair, 53BP1
accumulates at DSB sites downstream of the RNF168 ubiquitin ligase. How ubiquitin
recruits 53BP1 to break sites remains unknown as its relocalization involves
recognition of histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) methylation by its Tudor domain. Here we
elucidate how vertebrate 53BP1 is recruited to the chromatin that flanks DSB
sites. We show that 53BP1 recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated
H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys 15 (H2AK15ub), the latter being a
product of RNF168 action on chromatin. 53BP1 binds to nucleosomes minimally as a 
dimer using its previously characterized methyl-lysine-binding Tudor domain and a
carboxy-terminal extension, termed the ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR)
motif, which interacts with the epitope formed by H2AK15ub and its surrounding
residues on the H2A tail. 53BP1 is therefore a bivalent histone modification
reader that recognizes a histone 'code' produced by DSB signalling.

Many feeding behaviours are the result of stereotyped, organized sequences of
motor patterns. These patterns have been the subject of neuroethological studies,
such as electrophysiological characterization of neurons governing prey capture
in toads. However, technical limitations have prevented detailed study of the
functional role of these neurons, a common problem for vertebrate organisms.
Complexities involved in studies of whole-animal behaviour can be resolved in
Drosophila, in which remote activation of brain cells by genetic means enables us
to examine the nervous system in freely moving animals to identify neurons that
govern a specific behaviour, and then to repeatedly target and manipulate these
neurons to characterize their function. Here we show neurons that generate the
feeding motor program in Drosophila. We carried out an unbiased screen using
remote neuronal activation and identified a critical pair of brain cells that
induces the entire feeding sequence when activated. These 'feeding neurons' (here
abbreviated to Fdg neurons for brevity) are also essential for normal feeding as 
their suppression or ablation eliminates sugar-induced feeding behaviour.
Activation of a single Fdg neuron induces asymmetric feeding behaviour and
ablation of a single Fdg neuron distorts the sugar-induced feeding behaviour to
become asymmetric, indicating the direct role of these neurons in shaping
motor-program execution. Furthermore, recording neuronal activity and calcium
imaging simultaneously during feeding behaviour reveals that the Fdg neurons
respond to food presentation, but only in starved flies. Our results demonstrate 
that Fdg neurons operate firmly within the sensorimotor watershed, downstream of 
sensory and metabolic cues and at the top of the feeding motor hierarchy, to
execute the decision to feed.

ZFP36L2 is required for self-renewal of early burst-forming unit erythroid
progenitors.

Stem cells and progenitors in many lineages undergo self-renewing divisions, but 
the extracellular and intracellular proteins that regulate this process are
largely unknown. Glucocorticoids stimulate red blood cell formation by promoting 
self-renewal of early burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) progenitors. Here we
show that the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L2 is a transcriptional target of the
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in BFU-Es and is required for BFU-E self-renewal.
ZFP36L2 is normally downregulated during erythroid differentiation from the BFU-E
stage, but its expression is maintained by all tested GR agonists that stimulate 
BFU-E self-renewal, and the GR binds to several potential enhancer regions of
ZFP36L2. Knockdown of ZFP36L2 in cultured BFU-E cells did not affect the rate of 
cell division but disrupted glucocorticoid-induced BFU-E self-renewal, and
knockdown of ZFP36L2 in transplanted erythroid progenitors prevented expansion of
erythroid lineage progenitors normally seen following induction of anaemia by
phenylhydrazine treatment. ZFP36L2 preferentially binds to messenger RNAs that
are induced or maintained at high expression levels during terminal erythroid
differentiation and negatively regulates their expression levels. ZFP36L2
therefore functions as part of a molecular switch promoting BFU-E self-renewal
and a subsequent increase in the total numbers of colony-forming unit-erythroid
(CFU-E) progenitors and erythroid cells that are generated.

The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells presents a challenge to
normal developmental processes. The low efficiency and heterogeneity of most
methods have hindered understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms
promoting, and roadblocks preventing, efficient reprogramming. Although several
intermediate populations have been described, it has proved difficult to
characterize the rare, asynchronous transition from these intermediate stages to 
iPS cells. The rapid expansion of minor reprogrammed cells in the heterogeneous
population can also obscure investigation of relevant transition processes.
Understanding the biological mechanisms essential for successful iPS cell
generation requires both accurate capture of cells undergoing the reprogramming
process and identification of the associated global gene expression changes. Here
we demonstrate that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, reprogramming follows an
orderly sequence of stage transitions, marked by changes in the cell-surface
markers CD44 and ICAM1, and a Nanog-enhanced green fluorescent protein
(Nanog-eGFP) reporter. RNA-sequencing analysis of these populations demonstrates 
two waves of pluripotency gene upregulation, and unexpectedly, transient
upregulation of several epidermis-related genes, demonstrating that reprogramming
is not simply the reversal of the normal developmental processes. This novel
high-resolution analysis enables the construction of a detailed reprogramming
route map, and the improved understanding of the reprogramming process will lead 
to new reprogramming strategies.

Facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) is a conserved histone chaperone that 
reorganizes nucleosomes and ensures chromatin integrity during DNA transcription,
replication and repair. Key to the broad functions of FACT is its recognition of 
histones H2A-H2B (ref. 2). However, the structural basis for how histones H2A-H2B
are recognized and how this integrates with the other functions of FACT,
including the recognition of histones H3-H4 and other nuclear factors, is
unknown. Here we reveal the crystal structure of the evolutionarily conserved
FACT chaperone domain Spt16M from Chaetomium thermophilum, in complex with the
H2A-H2B heterodimer. A novel 'U-turn' motif scaffolded onto a Rtt106-like module 
embraces the α1 helix of H2B. Biochemical and in vivo assays validate the
structure and dissect the contribution of histone tails and H3-H4 towards Spt16M 
binding. Furthermore, we report the structure of the FACT heterodimerization
domain that connects FACT to replicative polymerases. Our results show that
Spt16M makes several interactions with histones, which we suggest allow the
module to invade the nucleosome gradually and block the strongest interaction of 
H2B with DNA. FACT would thus enhance 'nucleosome breathing' by re-organizing the
first 30 base pairs of nucleosomal histone-DNA contacts. Our snapshot of the
engagement of the chaperone with H2A-H2B and the structures of all globular FACT 
domains enable the high-resolution analysis of the vital chaperoning functions of
FACT, shedding light on how the complex promotes the activity of enzymes that
require nucleosome reorganization.

Influenza viruses pose a significant threat to the public and are a burden on
global health systems. Each year, influenza vaccines must be rapidly produced to 
match circulating viruses, a process constrained by dated technology and
vulnerable to unexpected strains emerging from humans and animal reservoirs. Here
we use knowledge of protein structure to design self-assembling nanoparticles
that elicit broader and more potent immunity than traditional influenza vaccines.
The viral haemagglutinin was genetically fused to ferritin, a protein that
naturally forms nanoparticles composed of 24 identical polypeptides.
Haemagglutinin was inserted at the interface of adjacent subunits so that it
spontaneously assembled and generated eight trimeric viral spikes on its surface.
Immunization with this influenza nanoparticle vaccine elicited haemagglutination 
inhibition antibody titres more than tenfold higher than those from the licensed 
inactivated vaccine. Furthermore, it elicited neutralizing antibodies to two
highly conserved vulnerable haemagglutinin structures that are targets of
universal vaccines: the stem and the receptor binding site on the head.
Antibodies elicited by a 1999 haemagglutinin-nanoparticle vaccine neutralized
H1N1 viruses from 1934 to 2007 and protected ferrets from an unmatched 2007 H1N1 
virus challenge. This structure-based, self-assembling synthetic nanoparticle
vaccine improves the potency and breadth of influenza virus immunity, and it
provides a foundation for building broader vaccine protection against emerging
influenza viruses and other pathogens.

Eukaryotic Ca(2+) regulation involves sequestration into intracellular
organelles, and expeditious Ca(2+) release into the cytosol is a hallmark of key 
signalling transduction pathways. Bulk removal of Ca(2+) after such signalling
events is accomplished by members of the Ca(2+):cation (CaCA) superfamily. The
CaCA superfamily includes the Na(+)/Ca(2+) (NCX) and Ca(2+)/H(+) (CAX)
antiporters, and in mammals the NCX and related proteins constitute families SLC8
and SLC24, and are responsible for the re-establishment of Ca(2+) resting
potential in muscle cells, neuronal signalling and Ca(2+) reabsorption in the
kidney. The CAX family members maintain cytosolic Ca(2+) homeostasis in plants
and fungi during steep rises in intracellular Ca(2+) due to environmental
changes, or following signal transduction caused by events such as hyperosmotic
shock, hormone response and response to mating pheromones. The cytosol-facing
conformations within the CaCA superfamily are unknown, and the transport
mechanism remains speculative. Here we determine a crystal structure of the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar Ca(2+)/H(+) exchanger (Vcx1) at 2.3 Å
resolution in a cytosol-facing, substrate-bound conformation. Vcx1 is the first
structure, to our knowledge, within the CAX family, and it describes the key
cytosol-facing conformation of the CaCA superfamily, providing the structural
basis for a novel alternating access mechanism by which the CaCA superfamily
performs high-throughput Ca(2+) transport across membranes.

Gene expression differs among individuals and populations and is thought to be a 
major determinant of phenotypic variation. Although variation and genetic loci
responsible for RNA expression levels have been analysed extensively in human
populations, our knowledge is limited regarding the differences in human protein 
abundance and the genetic basis for this difference. Variation in messenger RNA
expression is not a perfect surrogate for protein expression because the latter
is influenced by an array of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and,
empirically, the correlation between protein and mRNA levels is generally modest.
Here we used isobaric tag-based quantitative mass spectrometry to determine
relative protein levels of 5,953 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 95
diverse individuals genotyped in the HapMap Project. We found that protein levels
are heritable molecular phenotypes that exhibit considerable variation between
individuals, populations and sexes. Levels of specific sets of proteins involved 
in the same biological process covary among individuals, indicating that these
processes are tightly regulated at the protein level. We identified cis-pQTLs
(protein quantitative trait loci), including variants not detected by previous
transcriptome studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of high-throughput
human proteome quantification that, when integrated with DNA variation and
transcriptome information, adds a new dimension to the characterization of gene
expression regulation.

Elastic energy storage in the shoulder and the evolution of high-speed throwing
in Homo.

Some primates, including chimpanzees, throw objects occasionally, but only humans
regularly throw projectiles with high speed and accuracy. Darwin noted that the
unique throwing abilities of humans, which were made possible when bipedalism
emancipated the arms, enabled foragers to hunt effectively using projectiles.
However, there has been little consideration of the evolution of throwing in the 
years since Darwin made his observations, in part because of a lack of evidence
of when, how and why hominins evolved the ability to generate high-speed throws. 
Here we use experimental studies of humans throwing projectiles to show that our 
throwing capabilities largely result from several derived anatomical features
that enable elastic energy storage and release at the shoulder. These features
first appear together approximately 2 million years ago in the species Homo
erectus. Taking into consideration archaeological evidence suggesting that
hunting activity intensified around this time, we conclude that selection for
throwing as a means to hunt probably had an important role in the evolution of
the genus Homo.

Viscous convection within the mantle is linked to tectonic plate motions and
deforms Earth's surface across wide areas. Such close links between surface
geology and deep mantle dynamics presumably operated throughout Earth's history, 
but are difficult to investigate for past times because the history of mantle
flow is poorly known. Here we show that the time dependence of global-scale
mantle flow can be deduced from the net behaviour of surface plate motions. In
particular, we tracked the geographic locations of net convergence and divergence
for harmonic degrees 1 and 2 by computing the dipole and quadrupole moments of
plate motions from tectonic reconstructions extended back to the early Mesozoic
era. For present-day plate motions, we find dipole convergence in eastern Asia
and quadrupole divergence in both central Africa and the central Pacific. These
orientations are nearly identical to the dipole and quadrupole orientations of
underlying mantle flow, which indicates that these 'net characteristics' of plate
motions reveal deeper flow patterns. The positions of quadrupole divergence have 
not moved significantly during the past 250 million years, which suggests
long-term stability of mantle upwelling beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean.
These upwelling locations are positioned above two compositionally and
seismologically distinct regions of the lowermost mantle, which may organize
global mantle flow as they remain stationary over geologic time.

by rivers.

An important challenge in geomorphology is the reconciliation of the high fluvial
incision rates observed in tectonically active mountain ranges with the long-term
preservation of significant mountain-range relief in ancient, tectonically
inactive orogenic belts. River bedrock erosion and sediment transport are widely 
recognized to be the principal controls on the lifespan of mountain ranges. But
the factors controlling the rate of erosion and the reasons why they seem to vary
significantly as a function of tectonic activity remain controversial. Here we
use computational simulations to show that the key to understanding variations in
the rate of erosion between tectonically active and inactive mountain ranges may 
relate to a bidirectional coupling between bedrock river incision and landslides.
Whereas fluvial incision steepens surrounding hillslopes and increases landslide 
frequency, landsliding affects fluvial erosion rates in two fundamentally
distinct ways. On the one hand, large landslides overwhelm the river transport
capacity and cause upstream build up of sediment that protects the river bed from
further erosion. On the other hand, in delivering abrasive agents to the streams,
landslides help accelerate fluvial erosion. Our models illustrate how this
coupling has fundamentally different implications for rates of fluvial incision
in active and inactive mountain ranges. The coupling therefore provides a
plausible physical explanation for the preservation of significant mountain-range
relief in old orogenic belts, up to several hundred million years after tectonic 
activity has effectively ceased.

The application of novel technologies to silicon electronics has been intensively
studied with a view to overcoming the physical limitations of Moore's law, that
is, the observation that the number of components on integrated chips tends to
double every two years. For example, silicon devices have enormous potential for 
photonic integrated circuits on chips compatible with complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor devices, with various key elements having been
demonstrated in the past decade. In particular, a focus on the exploitation of
the Raman effect has added active optical functionality to pure silicon,
culminating in the realization of a continuous-wave all-silicon laser. This
achievement is an important step towards silicon photonics, but the desired
miniaturization to micrometre dimensions and the reduction of the threshold for
laser action to microwatt powers have yet to be achieved: such lasers remain
limited to centimetre-sized cavities with thresholds higher than 20 milliwatts,
even with the assistance of reverse-biased p-i-n diodes. Here we demonstrate a
continuous-wave Raman silicon laser using a photonic-crystal, high-quality-factor
nanocavity without any p-i-n diodes, yielding a device with a cavity size of less
than 10 micrometres and an unprecedentedly low lasing threshold of 1 microwatt.
Our nanocavity design exploits the principle that the strength of light-matter
interactions is proportional to the ratio of quality factor to the cavity volume 
and allows drastic enhancement of the Raman gain beyond that predicted
theoretically. Such a device may make it possible to construct practical silicon 
lasers and amplifiers for large-scale integration in photonic circuits.

Low-mass white-dwarf stars are the remnants of disrupted red-giant stars in
binary millisecond pulsars and other exotic binary star systems. Some low-mass
white dwarfs cool rapidly, whereas others stay bright for millions of years
because of stable fusion in thick surface hydrogen layers. This dichotomy is not 
well understood, so the potential use of low-mass white dwarfs as independent
clocks with which to test the spin-down ages of pulsars or as probes of the
extreme environments in which low-mass white dwarfs form cannot fully be
exploited. Here we report precise mass and radius measurements for the precursor 
to a low-mass white dwarf. We find that only models in which this disrupted
red-giant star has a thick hydrogen envelope can match the strong constraints
provided by our data. Very cool low-mass white dwarfs must therefore have lost
their thick hydrogen envelopes by irradiation from pulsar companions or by
episodes of unstable hydrogen fusion (shell flashes). We also find that this
low-mass white-dwarf precursor is a type of pulsating star not hitherto seen. The
observed pulsation frequencies are sensitive to internal processes that determine
whether this star will undergo shell flashes.

Human outer subventricular zone (OSVZ) neural progenitors and Drosophila type II 
neuroblasts both generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that populate
the adult cerebral cortex or central complex, respectively. It is unknown whether
INPs simply expand or also diversify neural cell types. Here we show that
Drosophila INPs sequentially generate distinct neural subtypes, that INPs
sequentially express Dichaete, Grainy head and Eyeless transcription factors, and
that these transcription factors are required for the production of distinct
neural subtypes. Moreover, parental type II neuroblasts also sequentially express
transcription factors and generate different neuronal/glial progeny over time,
providing a second temporal identity axis. We conclude that neuroblast and INP
temporal patterning axes act together to generate increased neural diversity
within the adult central complex; OSVZ progenitors may use similar mechanisms to 
increase neural diversity in the human brain.

In the Drosophila optic lobes, the medulla processes visual information coming
from inner photoreceptors R7 and R8 and from lamina neurons. It contains
approximately 40,000 neurons belonging to more than 70 different types. Here we
describe how precise temporal patterning of neural progenitors generates these
different neural types. Five transcription factors-Homothorax, Eyeless, Sloppy
paired, Dichaete and Tailless-are sequentially expressed in a temporal cascade in
each of the medulla neuroblasts as they age. Loss of Eyeless, Sloppy paired or
Dichaete blocks further progression of the temporal sequence. We provide evidence
that this temporal sequence in neuroblasts, together with Notch-dependent binary 
fate choice, controls the diversification of the neuronal progeny. Although a
temporal sequence of transcription factors had been identified in Drosophila
embryonic neuroblasts, our work illustrates the generality of this strategy, with
different sequences of transcription factors being used in different contexts.

Despite current treatment regimens, heart failure remains the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in the developed world due to the limited capacity of
adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes to divide and replace ventricular
myocardium lost from ischaemia-induced infarct. Hence there is great interest to 
identify potential cellular sources and strategies to generate new ventricular
myocardium. Past studies have shown that fish and amphibians and early postnatal 
mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes can proliferate to help regenerate injured
ventricles; however, recent studies have suggested that additional endogenous
cellular sources may contribute to this overall ventricular regeneration. Here we
have developed, in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), a combination of fluorescent
reporter transgenes, genetic fate-mapping strategies and a ventricle-specific
genetic ablation system to discover that differentiated atrial cardiomyocytes can
transdifferentiate into ventricular cardiomyocytes to contribute to zebrafish
cardiac ventricular regeneration. Using in vivo time-lapse and confocal imaging, 
we monitored the dynamic cellular events during atrial-to-ventricular
cardiomyocyte transdifferentiation to define intermediate cardiac reprogramming
stages. We observed that Notch signalling becomes activated in the atrial
endocardium following ventricular ablation, and discovered that inhibiting Notch 
signalling blocked the atrial-to-ventricular transdifferentiation and cardiac
regeneration. Overall, these studies not only provide evidence for the plasticity
of cardiac lineages during myocardial injury, but more importantly reveal an
abundant new potential cardiac resident cellular source for cardiac ventricular
regeneration.

The generation, distribution and control of entanglement across quantum networks 
is one of the main goals of quantum information science. In previous studies,
hyperfine ground states of single atoms or atomic ensembles have been entangled
with spontaneously emitted light. The probabilistic character of the spontaneous 
emission process leads to long entanglement generation times, limiting realized
network implementations to just two nodes. The success probability for
atom-photon entanglement protocols can be increased by confining a single atom in
a high-finesse optical cavity. Alternatively, quantum networks with superior
scaling properties could be achieved using entanglement between light fields and 
atoms in quantum superpositions of the ground and highly excited (Rydberg)
electronic states. Here we report the generation of such entanglement. The
dephasing of the optical atomic coherence is inhibited by state-insensitive
confinement of both the ground and Rydberg states of an ultracold atomic gas in
an optical lattice. Our results pave the way for functional, many-node quantum
networks capable of deterministic quantum logic operations between long-lived
atomic memories.

Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a vascular dysplasia, mainly localized
within the brain and affecting up to 0.5% of the human population. CCM lesions
are formed by enlarged and irregular blood vessels that often result in cerebral 
haemorrhages. CCM is caused by loss-of-function mutations in one of three genes, 
namely CCM1 (also known as KRIT1), CCM2 (OSM) and CCM3 (PDCD10), and occurs in
both sporadic and familial forms. Recent studies have investigated the cause of
vascular dysplasia and fragility in CCM, but the in vivo functions of this
ternary complex remain unclear. Postnatal deletion of any of the three Ccm genes 
in mouse endothelium results in a severe phenotype, characterized by multiple
brain vascular malformations that are markedly similar to human CCM lesions.
Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) has been described in different
pathologies, and it is defined as the acquisition of mesenchymal- and
stem-cell-like characteristics by the endothelium. Here we show that
endothelial-specific disruption of the Ccm1 gene in mice induces EndMT, which
contributes to the development of vascular malformations. EndMT in CCM1-ablated
endothelial cells is mediated by the upregulation of endogenous BMP6 that, in
turn, activates the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) signalling pathway. Inhibitors of the TGF-β and BMP pathway prevent
EndMT both in vitro and in vivo and reduce the number and size of vascular
lesions in CCM1-deficient mice. Thus, increased TGF-β and BMP signalling, and the
consequent EndMT of CCM1-null endothelial cells, are crucial events in the onset 
and progression of CCM disease. These studies offer novel therapeutic
opportunities for this severe, and so far incurable, pathology.

Unusual architecture of the p7 channel from hepatitis C virus.

The hepatitis C virus (HCV) has developed a small membrane protein, p7, which
remarkably can self-assemble into a large channel complex that selectively
conducts cations. We wanted to examine the structural solution that the viroporin
adopts in order to achieve selective cation conduction, because p7 has no
homology with any of the known prokaryotic or eukaryotic channel proteins. The
activity of p7 can be inhibited by amantadine and rimantadine, which are potent
blockers of the influenza M2 channel and licensed drugs against influenza
infections. The adamantane derivatives have been used in HCV clinical trials, but
large variation in drug efficacy among the various HCV genotypes has been
difficult to explain without detailed molecular structures. Here we determine the
structures of this HCV viroporin as well as its drug-binding site using the
latest nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technologies. The structure exhibits an
unusual mode of hexameric assembly, where the individual p7 monomers, i, not only
interact with their immediate neighbours, but also reach farther to associate
with the i+2 and i+3 monomers, forming a sophisticated, funnel-like architecture.
The structure also points to a mechanism of cation selection: an
asparagine/histidine ring that constricts the narrow end of the funnel serves as 
a broad cation selectivity filter, whereas an arginine/lysine ring that defines
the wide end of the funnel may selectively allow cation diffusion into the
channel. Our functional investigation using whole-cell channel recording shows
that these residues are critical for channel activity. NMR measurements of the
channel-drug complex revealed six equivalent hydrophobic pockets between the
peripheral and pore-forming helices to which amantadine or rimantadine binds, and
compound binding specifically to this position may allosterically inhibit cation 
conduction by preventing the channel from opening. Our data provide a molecular
explanation for p7-mediated cation conductance and its inhibition by adamantane
derivatives.

Sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in host blood
vessels is a key triggering event in the pathogenesis of severe childhood
malaria, which is responsible for about one million deaths every year.
Sequestration is mediated by specific interactions between members of the P.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family and receptors on the
endothelial lining. Severe childhood malaria is associated with expression of
specific PfEMP1 subtypes containing domain cassettes (DCs) 8 and 13 (ref. 3), but
the endothelial receptor for parasites expressing these proteins was unknown.
Here we identify endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which mediates the
cytoprotective effects of activated protein C, as the endothelial receptor for
DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1. We show that EPCR binding is mediated through the
amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDRα1) of DC8 and group A
PfEMP1 subfamilies, and that CIDRα1 interferes with protein C binding to EPCR.
This PfEMP1 adhesive property links P. falciparum cytoadhesion to a host receptor
involved in anticoagulation and endothelial cytoprotective pathways, and has
implications for understanding malaria pathology and the development of new
malaria interventions.

Rev-Erb-α and Rev-Erb-β are nuclear receptors that regulate the expression of
genes involved in the control of circadian rhythm, metabolism and inflammatory
responses. Rev-Erbs function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting nuclear 
receptor co-repressor (NCoR)-HDAC3 complexes to Rev-Erb response elements in
enhancers and promoters of target genes, but the molecular basis for
cell-specific programs of repression is not known. Here we present evidence that 
in mouse macrophages Rev-Erbs regulate target gene expression by inhibiting the
functions of distal enhancers that are selected by macrophage-lineage-determining
factors, thereby establishing a macrophage-specific program of repression.
Remarkably, the repressive functions of Rev-Erbs are associated with their
ability to inhibit the transcription of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs).
Furthermore, targeted degradation of eRNAs at two enhancers subject to negative
regulation by Rev-Erbs resulted in reduced expression of nearby messenger RNAs,
suggesting a direct role of these eRNAs in enhancer function. By precisely
defining eRNA start sites using a modified form of global run-on sequencing that 
quantifies nascent 5' ends, we show that transfer of full enhancer activity to a 
target promoter requires both the sequences mediating transcription-factor
binding and the specific sequences encoding the eRNA transcript. These studies
provide evidence for a direct role of eRNAs in contributing to enhancer functions
and suggest that Rev-Erbs act to suppress gene expression at a distance by
repressing eRNA transcription.

The functional importance of gene enhancers in regulated gene expression is well 
established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, 
and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained
unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer
activation. Here we report that in human breast cancer cells 17β-oestradiol
(E2)-bound oestrogen receptor α (ER-α) causes a global increase in eRNA
transcription on enhancers adjacent to E2-upregulated coding genes. These induced
eRNAs, as functional transcripts, seem to exert important roles for the observed 
ligand-dependent induction of target coding genes, increasing the strength of
specific enhancer-promoter looping initiated by ER-α binding. Cohesin, present on
many ER-α-regulated enhancers even before ligand treatment, apparently
contributes to E2-dependent gene activation, at least in part by stabilizing
E2/ER-α/eRNA-induced enhancer-promoter looping. Our data indicate that eRNAs are 
likely to have important functions in many regulated programs of gene
transcription.

Through their functional diversification, distinct lineages of CD4(+) T cells can
act to either drive or constrain immune-mediated pathology. Transcription factors
are critical in the generation of cellular diversity, and negative regulators
antagonistic to alternate fates often act in conjunction with positive regulators
to stabilize lineage commitment. Genetic polymorphisms within a single locus
encoding the transcription factor BACH2 are associated with numerous autoimmune
and allergic diseases including asthma, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease,
vitiligo, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Although these associations
point to a shared mechanism underlying susceptibility to diverse immune-mediated 
diseases, a function for BACH2 in the maintenance of immune homeostasis has not
been established. Here, by studying mice in which the Bach2 gene is disrupted, we
define BACH2 as a broad regulator of immune activation that stabilizes
immunoregulatory capacity while repressing the differentiation programs of
multiple effector lineages in CD4(+) T cells. BACH2 was required for efficient
formation of regulatory (Treg) cells and consequently for suppression of lethal
inflammation in a manner that was Treg-cell-dependent. Assessment of the
genome-wide function of BACH2, however, revealed that it represses genes
associated with effector cell differentiation. Consequently, its absence during
Treg polarization resulted in inappropriate diversion to effector lineages. In
addition, BACH2 constrained full effector differentiation within TH1, TH2 and
TH17 cell lineages. These findings identify BACH2 as a key regulator of CD4(+)
T-cell differentiation that prevents inflammatory disease by controlling the
balance between tolerance and immunity.

Female mosquitoes of some species are generalists and will blood-feed on a
variety of vertebrate hosts, whereas others display marked host preference.
Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti have evolved a strong preference for humans, 
making them dangerously efficient vectors of malaria and Dengue haemorrhagic
fever. Specific host odours probably drive this strong preference because other
attractive cues, including body heat and exhaled carbon dioxide (CO2), are common
to all warm-blooded hosts. Insects sense odours via several chemosensory receptor
families, including the odorant receptors (ORs), membrane proteins that form
heteromeric odour-gated ion channels comprising a variable ligand-selective
subunit and an obligate co-receptor called Orco (ref. 6). Here we use zinc-finger
nucleases to generate targeted mutations in the orco gene of A. aegypti to
examine the contribution of Orco and the odorant receptor pathway to mosquito
host selection and sensitivity to the insect repellent DEET
(N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). orco mutant olfactory sensory neurons have greatly 
reduced spontaneous activity and lack odour-evoked responses. Behaviourally, orco
mutant mosquitoes have severely reduced attraction to honey, an odour cue related
to floral nectar, and do not respond to human scent in the absence of CO2.
However, in the presence of CO2, female orco mutant mosquitoes retain strong
attraction to both human and animal hosts, but no longer strongly prefer humans. 
orco mutant females are attracted to human hosts even in the presence of DEET,
but are repelled upon contact, indicating that olfactory- and contact-mediated
effects of DEET are mechanistically distinct. We conclude that the odorant
receptor pathway is crucial for an anthropophilic vector mosquito to discriminate
human from non-human hosts and to be effectively repelled by volatile DEET.

Allostery is an intrinsic property of many globular proteins and enzymes that is 
indispensable for cellular regulatory and feedback mechanisms. Recent theoretical
and empirical observations indicate that allostery is also manifest in
intrinsically disordered proteins, which account for a substantial proportion of 
the proteome. Many intrinsically disordered proteins are promiscuous binders that
interact with multiple partners and frequently function as molecular hubs in
protein interaction networks. The adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein is
a prime example of a molecular hub intrinsically disordered protein. E1A can
induce marked epigenetic reprogramming of the cell within hours after infection, 
through interactions with a diverse set of partners that include key host
regulators such as the general transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein
(CBP), its paralogue p300, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb; also called RB1).
Little is known about the allosteric effects at play in E1A-CBP-pRb interactions,
or more generally in hub intrinsically disordered protein interaction networks.
Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to
study coupled binding and folding processes in the ternary E1A system. The low
concentrations used in these high-sensitivity experiments proved to be essential 
for these studies, which are challenging owing to a combination of E1A
aggregation propensity and high-affinity binding interactions. Our data revealed 
that E1A-CBP-pRb interactions have either positive or negative cooperativity,
depending on the available E1A interaction sites. This striking cooperativity
switch enables fine-tuning of the thermodynamic accessibility of the ternary
versus binary E1A complexes, and may permit a context-specific tuning of
associated downstream signalling outputs. Such a modulation of allosteric
interactions is probably a common mechanism in molecular hub intrinsically
disordered protein function.

On being heated, ice melts into liquid water. Although in practice this process
tends to be heterogeneous, it can occur homogeneously inside bulk ice. The
thermally induced homogeneous melting of solids is fairly well understood, and
involves the formation and growth of melting nuclei. But in the case of water,
resilient hydrogen bonds render ice melting more complex. We know that the first 
defects appearing during homogeneous ice melting are pairs of five- and
seven-membered rings, which appear and disappear repeatedly and randomly in space
and time in the crystalline ice structure. However, the accumulation of these
defects to form an aggregate is nearly additive in energy, and results in a steep
free energy increase that suppresses further growth. Here we report molecular
dynamics simulations of homogeneous ice melting that identify as a crucial first 
step not the formation but rather the spatial separation of a defect pair. We
find that once it is separated, the defect pair--either an interstitial (I) and a
vacancy (V) defect pair (a Frenkel pair), or an L and a D defect pair (a Bjerrum 
pair)--is entropically stabilized, or 'entangled'. In this state, defects with
threefold hydrogen-bond coordination persist and grow, and thereby prepare the
system for subsequent rapid melting.

The properties of exotic nuclei on the verge of existence play a fundamental part
in our understanding of nuclear interactions. Exceedingly neutron-rich nuclei
become sensitive to new aspects of nuclear forces. Calcium, with its doubly magic
isotopes (40)Ca and (48)Ca, is an ideal test for nuclear shell evolution, from
the valley of stability to the limits of existence. With a closed proton shell,
the calcium isotopes mark the frontier for calculations with three-nucleon forces
from chiral effective field theory. Whereas predictions for the masses of (51)Ca 
and (52)Ca have been validated by direct measurements, it is an open question as 
to how nuclear masses evolve for heavier calcium isotopes. Here we report the
mass determination of the exotic calcium isotopes (53)Ca and (54)Ca, using the
multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer of ISOLTRAP at CERN. The
measured masses unambiguously establish a prominent shell closure at neutron
number N = 32, in excellent agreement with our theoretical calculations. These
results increase our understanding of neutron-rich matter and pin down the subtle
components of nuclear forces that are at the forefront of theoretical
developments constrained by quantum chromodynamics.

Volcanism on Mars controlled by early oxidation of the upper mantle.

Detailed information about the chemical composition and evolution of Mars has
been derived principally from the SNC (shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite)
meteorites, which are genetically related igneous rocks of Martian origin. They
are chemically and texturally similar to terrestrial basalts and cumulates,
except that they have higher concentrations of iron and volatile elements such as
phosphorus and chlorine and lower concentrations of nickel and other chalcophile 
(sulphur-loving) elements. Most Martian meteorites have relatively young
crystallization ages (1.4 billion years to 180 million years ago) and are
considered to be derived from young, lightly cratered volcanic regions, such as
the Tharsis plateau. Surface rocks from the Gusev crater analysed by the Spirit
rover are much older (about 3.7 billion years old) and exhibit marked
compositional differences from the meteorites. Although also basaltic in
composition, the surface rocks are richer in nickel and sulphur and have lower
manganese/iron ratios than the meteorites. This has led to doubts that Mars can
be described adequately using the 'SNC model'. Here we show, however, that the
differences between the compositions of meteorites and surface rocks can be
explained by differences in the oxygen fugacity during melting of the same
sulphur-rich mantle. This ties the sources of Martian meteorites to those of the 
surface rocks through an early (>3.7 billion years ago) oxidation of the
uppermost mantle that had less influence on the deeper regions, which produce the
more recent volcanic rocks.

Every holographic video display is built on a spatial light modulator, which
directs light by diffraction to form points in three-dimensional space. The
modulators currently used for holographic video displays are challenging to use
for several reasons: they have relatively low bandwidth, high cost, low
diffraction angle, poor scalability, and the presence of quantization noise,
unwanted diffractive orders and zero-order light. Here we present modulators for 
holographic video displays based on anisotropic leaky-mode couplers, which have
the potential to address all of these challenges. These modulators can be
fabricated simply, monolithically and at low cost. Additionally, these modulators
are capable of new functionalities, such as wavelength division multiplexing for 
colour display. We demonstrate three enabling properties of particular
interest-polarization rotation, enlarged angular diffraction, and frequency
domain colour filtering-and suggest that this technology can be used as a
platform for low-cost, high-performance holographic video displays.

The amount of ice present in mixed-phase clouds, which contain both supercooled
liquid water droplets and ice particles, affects cloud extent, lifetime, particle
size and radiative properties. The freezing of cloud droplets can be catalysed by
the presence of aerosol particles known as ice nuclei. One of the most important 
ice nuclei is thought to be mineral dust aerosol from arid regions. It is
generally assumed that clay minerals, which contribute approximately two-thirds
of the dust mass, dominate ice nucleation by mineral dust, and many experimental 
studies have therefore focused on these materials. Here we use an established
droplet-freezing technique to show that feldspar minerals dominate ice nucleation
by mineral dusts under mixed-phase cloud conditions, despite feldspar being a
minor component of dust emitted from arid regions. We also find that clay
minerals are relatively unimportant ice nuclei. Our results from a global aerosol
model study suggest that feldspar ice nuclei are globally distributed and that
feldspar particles may account for a large proportion of the ice nuclei in
Earth's atmosphere that contribute to freezing at temperatures below about
-15 °C.

Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has infected more than 60 million people
and caused nearly 30 million deaths worldwide, ultimately the consequence of
cytolytic infection of CD4(+) T cells. In humans and in macaque models, most of
these cells contain viral DNA and are rapidly eliminated at the peak of viraemia,
yet the mechanism by which HIV-1 induces helper T-cell death has not been
defined. Here we show that virus-induced cell killing is triggered by viral
integration. Infection by wild-type HIV-1, but not an integrase-deficient mutant,
induced the death of activated primary CD4 lymphocytes. Similarly, raltegravir, a
pharmacologic integrase inhibitor, abolished HIV-1-induced cell killing both in
cell culture and in CD4(+) T cells from acutely infected subjects. The mechanism 
of killing during viral integration involved the activation of DNA-dependent
protein kinase (DNA-PK), a central integrator of the DNA damage response, which
caused phosphorylation of p53 and histone H2AX. Pharmacological inhibition of
DNA-PK abolished cell death during HIV-1 infection in vitro, suggesting that
processes which reduce DNA-PK activation in CD4 cells could facilitate the
formation of latently infected cells that give rise to reservoirs in vivo. We
propose that activation of DNA-PK during viral integration has a central role in 
CD4(+) T-cell depletion, raising the possibility that integrase inhibitors and
interventions directed towards DNA-PK may improve T-cell survival and immune
function in infected individuals.

Cytosolic DNA arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections is a
powerful pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that leads to innate immune
host defence by the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines.
Recognition of cytosolic DNA by the recently discovered cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP)
synthase (cGAS) induces the production of cGAMP to activate the stimulator of
interferon genes (STING). Here we report the crystal structure of cGAS alone and 
in complex with DNA, ATP and GTP along with functional studies. Our results
explain the broad DNA sensing specificity of cGAS, show how cGAS catalyses
dinucleotide formation and indicate activation by a DNA-induced structural
switch. cGAS possesses a remarkable structural similarity to the antiviral
cytosolic double-stranded RNA sensor 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthase (OAS1), but
contains a unique zinc thumb that recognizes B-form double-stranded DNA. Our
results mechanistically unify dsRNA and dsDNA innate immune sensing by OAS1 and
cGAS nucleotidyl transferases.

Detection of cytoplasmic DNA represents one of the most fundamental mechanisms of
the innate immune system to sense the presence of microbial pathogens. Moreover, 
erroneous detection of endogenous DNA by the same sensing mechanisms has an
important pathophysiological role in certain sterile inflammatory conditions. The
endoplasmic-reticulum-resident protein STING is critically required for the
initiation of type I interferon signalling upon detection of cytosolic DNA of
both exogenous and endogenous origin. Next to its pivotal role in DNA sensing,
STING also serves as a direct receptor for the detection of cyclic dinucleotides,
which function as second messenger molecules in bacteria. DNA recognition,
however, is triggered in an indirect fashion that depends on a recently
characterized cytoplasmic nucleotidyl transferase, termed cGAMP synthase (cGAS), 
which upon interaction with DNA synthesizes a dinucleotide molecule that in turn 
binds to and activates STING. We here show in vivo and in vitro that the
cGAS-catalysed reaction product is distinct from previously characterized cyclic 
dinucleotides. Using a combinatorial approach based on mass spectrometry,
enzymatic digestion, NMR analysis and chemical synthesis we demonstrate that cGAS
produces a cyclic GMP-AMP dinucleotide, which comprises a 2'-5' and a 3'-5'
phosphodiester linkage >Gp(2'-5')Ap(3'-5')>. We found that the presence of this
2'-5' linkage was required to exert potent activation of human STING. Moreover,
we show that cGAS first catalyses the synthesis of a linear 2'-5'-linked
dinucleotide, which is then subject to cGAS-dependent cyclization in a second
step through a 3'-5' phosphodiester linkage. This 13-membered ring structure
defines a novel class of second messenger molecules, extending the family of
2'-5'-linked antiviral biomolecules.

Many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and
polyglutamine diseases, share a common pathogenic mechanism: the abnormal
accumulation of disease-causing proteins, due to either the mutant protein's
resistance to degradation or overexpression of the wild-type protein. We have
developed a strategy to identify therapeutic entry points for such
neurodegenerative disorders by screening for genetic networks that influence the 
levels of disease-driving proteins. We applied this approach, which integrates
parallel cell-based and Drosophila genetic screens, to spinocerebellar ataxia
type 1 (SCA1), a disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ataxin 1
(ATXN1). Our approach revealed that downregulation of several components of the
RAS-MAPK-MSK1 pathway decreases ATXN1 levels and suppresses neurodegeneration in 
Drosophila and mice. Importantly, pharmacological inhibitors of components of
this pathway also decrease ATXN1 levels, suggesting that these components
represent new therapeutic targets in mitigating SCA1. Collectively, these data
reveal new therapeutic entry points for SCA1 and provide a proof-of-principle for
tackling other classes of intractable neurodegenerative diseases.

The recent discovery of small paravian theropod dinosaurs with well-preserved
feathers in the Middle-Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning Province
(northeastern China) has challenged the pivotal position of Archaeopteryx,
regarded from its discovery to be the most basal bird. Removing Archaeopteryx
from the base of Avialae to nest within Deinonychosauria implies that typical
bird flight, powered by the forelimbs only, either evolved at least twice, or was
subsequently lost or modified in some deinonychosaurians. Here we describe the
complete skeleton of a new paravian from the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning
Province, China. Including this new taxon in a comprehensive phylogenetic
analysis for basal Paraves does the following: (1) it recovers it as the
basal-most avialan; (2) it confirms the avialan status of Archaeopteryx; (3) it
places Troodontidae as the sister-group to Avialae; (4) it supports a single
origin of powered flight within Paraves; and (5) it implies that the early
diversification of Paraves and Avialae took place in the Middle-Late Jurassic
period.

A complex interaction of signalling events, including the Wnt pathway, regulates 
sprouting of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature during angiogenesis.
Here we show that two distinct mutations in the (uro)chordate-specific gumby
(also called Fam105b) gene cause an embryonic angiogenic phenotype in gumby mice.
Gumby interacts with disheveled 2 (DVL2), is expressed in canonical
Wnt-responsive endothelial cells and encodes an ovarian tumour domain class of
deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves linear ubiquitin linkages. A crystal
structure of gumby in complex with linear diubiquitin reveals how the identified 
mutations adversely affect substrate binding and catalytic function in line with 
the severity of their angiogenic phenotypes. Gumby interacts with HOIP (also
called RNF31), a key component of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex, and
decreases linear ubiquitination and activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription. 
This work provides support for the biological importance of linear
(de)ubiquitination in angiogenesis, craniofacial and neural development and in
modulating Wnt signalling.

Neutrophil recruitment from blood to extravascular sites of sterile or infectious
tissue damage is a hallmark of early innate immune responses, and the molecular
events leading to cell exit from the bloodstream have been well defined. Once
outside the vessel, individual neutrophils often show extremely coordinated
chemotaxis and cluster formation reminiscent of the swarming behaviour of
insects. The molecular players that direct this response at the single-cell and
population levels within the complexity of an inflamed tissue are unknown. Using 
two-photon intravital microscopy in mouse models of sterile injury and infection,
we show a critical role for intercellular signal relay among neutrophils mediated
by the lipid leukotriene B4, which acutely amplifies local cell death signals to 
enhance the radius of highly directed interstitial neutrophil recruitment.
Integrin receptors are dispensable for long-distance migration, but have a
previously unappreciated role in maintaining dense cellular clusters when
congregating neutrophils rearrange the collagenous fibre network of the dermis to
form a collagen-free zone at the wound centre. In this newly formed environment, 
integrins, in concert with neutrophil-derived leukotriene B4 and other
chemoattractants, promote local neutrophil interaction while forming a tight
wound seal. This wound seal has borders that cease to grow in kinetic concert
with late recruitment of monocytes and macrophages at the edge of the displaced
collagen fibres. Together, these data provide an initial molecular map of the
factors that contribute to neutrophil swarming in the extravascular space of a
damaged tissue. They reveal how local events are propagated over large-range
distances, and how auto-signalling produces coordinated, self-organized
neutrophil-swarming behaviour that isolates the wound or infectious site from
surrounding viable tissue.

Neurons in the prefrontal cortex exhibit diverse behavioural correlates, an
observation that has been attributed to cell-type diversity. To link identified
neuron types with network and behavioural functions, we recorded from the two
largest genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes, the perisomatically
targeting parvalbumin (PV) and the dendritically targeting somatostatin (SOM)
neurons in anterior cingulate cortex of mice performing a reward foraging task.
Here we show that PV and a subtype of SOM neurons form functionally homogeneous
populations showing a double dissociation between both their inhibitory effects
and behavioural correlates. Out of several events pertaining to behaviour, a
subtype of SOM neurons selectively responded at reward approach, whereas PV
neurons responded at reward leaving and encoded preceding stay duration. These
behavioural correlates of PV and SOM neurons defined a behavioural epoch and a
decision variable important for foraging (whether to stay or to leave), a crucial
function attributed to the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, PV neurons
could fire in millisecond synchrony, exerting fast and powerful inhibition on
principal cell firing, whereas the inhibitory effect of SOM neurons on firing
output was weak and more variable, consistent with the idea that they
respectively control the outputs of, and inputs to, principal neurons. These
results suggest a connection between the circuit-level function of different
interneuron types in regulating the flow of information and the behavioural
functions served by the cortical circuits. Moreover, these observations bolster
the hope that functional response diversity during behaviour can in part be
explained by cell-type diversity.

Traditional culture-based methods have incompletely defined the microbial
landscape of common recalcitrant human fungal skin diseases, including athlete's 
foot and toenail infections. Skin protects humans from invasion by pathogenic
microorganisms and provides a home for diverse commensal microbiota. Bacterial
genomic sequence data have generated novel hypotheses about species and community
structures underlying human disorders. However, microbial diversity is not
limited to bacteria; microorganisms such as fungi also have major roles in
microbial community stability, human health and disease. Genomic methodologies to
identify fungal species and communities have been limited compared with those
that are available for bacteria. Fungal evolution can be reconstructed with
phylogenetic markers, including ribosomal RNA gene regions and other highly
conserved genes. Here we sequenced and analysed fungal communities of 14 skin
sites in 10 healthy adults. Eleven core-body and arm sites were dominated by
fungi of the genus Malassezia, with only species-level classifications revealing 
fungal-community composition differences between sites. By contrast, three foot
sites--plantar heel, toenail and toe web--showed high fungal diversity.
Concurrent analysis of bacterial and fungal communities demonstrated that
physiologic attributes and topography of skin differentially shape these two
microbial communities. These results provide a framework for future investigation
of the contribution of interactions between pathogenic and commensal fungal and
bacterial communities to the maintainenace of human health and to disease
pathogenesis.

Stellar archaeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies formed rapidly about
ten billion years ago with star-formation rates of above several hundred solar
masses per year. Their progenitors are probably the submillimetre bright galaxies
at redshifts z greater than 2. Although the mean molecular gas mass (5 × 10(10)
solar masses) of the submillimetre bright galaxies can explain the formation of
typical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form elliptical galaxies that
already have stellar masses above 2 × 10(11) solar masses at z ≈ 2. Here we
report multi-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two
massive submillimetre bright galaxies at z = 2.3. The system is seen to be
forming stars at a rate of 2,000 solar masses per year. The star-formation
efficiency is an order of magnitude greater than that of normal galaxies, so the 
gas reservoir will be exhausted and star formation will be quenched in only
around 200 million years. At a projected separation of 19 kiloparsecs, the two
massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passive elliptical galaxy with a
stellar mass of about 4 × 10(11) solar masses. We conclude that gas-rich major
galaxy mergers with intense star formation can form the most massive elliptical
galaxies by z ≈ 1.5.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that has critical roles in gene
silencing, development and genome integrity. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation is
established by DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) and targeted by
24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through a pathway termed
RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). This pathway requires two plant-specific RNA
polymerases: Pol-IV, which functions to initiate siRNA biogenesis, and Pol-V,
which functions to generate scaffold transcripts that recruit downstream RdDM
factors. To understand the mechanisms controlling Pol-IV targeting we
investigated the function of SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1), a
Pol-IV-interacting protein. Here we show that SHH1 acts upstream in the RdDM
pathway to enable siRNA production from a large subset of the most active RdDM
targets, and that SHH1 is required for Pol-IV occupancy at these same loci. We
also show that the SHH1 SAWADEE domain is a novel chromatin-binding module that
adopts a unique tandem Tudor-like fold and functions as a dual lysine reader,
probing for both unmethylated K4 and methylated K9 modifications on the histone 3
(H3) tail. Finally, we show that key residues within both lysine-binding pockets 
of SHH1 are required in vivo to maintain siRNA and DNA methylation levels as well
as Pol-IV occupancy at RdDM targets, demonstrating a central role for methylated 
H3K9 binding in SHH1 function and providing the first insights into the mechanism
of Pol-IV targeting. Given the parallels between methylation systems in plants
and mammals, a further understanding of this early targeting step may aid our
ability to control the expression of endogenous and newly introduced genes, which
has broad implications for agriculture and gene therapy.

Water has been thought to affect the dynamical processes in the Earth's interior 
to a great extent. In particular, experimental deformation results suggest that
even only a few tens of parts per million of water by weight enhances the creep
rates in olivine by orders of magnitude. However, those deformation studies have 
limitations, such as considering only a limited range of water concentrations and
very high stresses, which might affect the results. Rock deformation can also be 
understood as an effect of silicon self-diffusion, because the creep rates of
minerals at temperatures as high as those in the Earth's interior are limited by 
self-diffusion of the slowest species. Here we experimentally determine the
silicon self-diffusion coefficient DSi in forsterite at 8 GPa and 1,600 K to
1,800 K as a function of water content CH2O from less than 1 to about 800 parts
per million of water by weight, yielding the relationship, DSi ≈ (CH2O)(1/3).
This exponent is strikingly lower than that obtained by deformation experiments
(1.2; ref. 7). The high nominal creep rates in the deformation studies under wet 
conditions may be caused by excess grain boundary water. We conclude that the
effect of water on upper-mantle rheology is very small. Hence, the smooth motion 
of the Earth's tectonic plates cannot be caused by mineral hydration in the
asthenosphere. Also, water cannot cause the viscosity minimum zone in the upper
mantle. And finally, the dominant mechanism responsible for hotspot immobility
cannot be water content differences between their source and surrounding regions.

Heat dissipation in atomic-scale junctions.

Atomic and single-molecule junctions represent the ultimate limit to the
miniaturization of electrical circuits. They are also ideal platforms for testing
quantum transport theories that are required to describe charge and energy
transfer in novel functional nanometre-scale devices. Recent work has
successfully probed electric and thermoelectric phenomena in atomic-scale
junctions. However, heat dissipation and transport in atomic-scale devices remain
poorly characterized owing to experimental challenges. Here we use
custom-fabricated scanning probes with integrated nanoscale thermocouples to
investigate heat dissipation in the electrodes of single-molecule ('molecular')
junctions. We find that if the junctions have transmission characteristics that
are strongly energy dependent, this heat dissipation is asymmetric--that is,
unequal between the electrodes--and also dependent on both the bias polarity and 
the identity of the majority charge carriers (electrons versus holes). In
contrast, junctions consisting of only a few gold atoms ('atomic junctions')
whose transmission characteristics show weak energy dependence do not exhibit
appreciable asymmetry. Our results unambiguously relate the electronic
transmission characteristics of atomic-scale junctions to their heat dissipation 
properties, establishing a framework for understanding heat dissipation in a
range of mesoscopic systems where transport is elastic--that is, without exchange
of energy in the contact region. We anticipate that the techniques established
here will enable the study of Peltier effects at the atomic scale, a field that
has been barely explored experimentally despite interesting theoretical
predictions. Furthermore, the experimental advances described here are also
expected to enable the study of heat transport in atomic and molecular
junctions--an important and challenging scientific and technological goal that
has remained elusive.

Although the cheetah is recognised as the fastest land animal, little is known
about other aspects of its notable athleticism, particularly when hunting in the 
wild. Here we describe and use a new tracking collar of our own design,
containing a combination of Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial
measurement units, to capture the locomotor dynamics and outcome of 367
predominantly hunting runs of five wild cheetahs in Botswana. A remarkable top
speed of 25.9 m s(-1) (58 m.p.h. or 93 km h(-1)) was recorded, but most cheetah
hunts involved only moderate speeds. We recorded some of the highest measured
values for lateral and forward acceleration, deceleration and body-mass-specific 
power for any terrestrial mammal. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed
locomotor information on the hunting dynamics of a large cursorial predator in
its natural habitat.

G-protein-gated inward rectifier K(+) (GIRK) channels allow neurotransmitters,
through G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation, to control cellular electrical
excitability. In cardiac and neuronal cells this control regulates heart rate and
neural circuit activity, respectively. Here we present the 3.5 Å resolution
crystal structure of the mammalian GIRK2 channel in complex with βγ G-protein
subunits, the central signalling complex that links G-protein-coupled receptor
stimulation to K(+) channel activity. Short-range atomic and long-range
electrostatic interactions stabilize four βγ G-protein subunits at the interfaces
between four K(+) channel subunits, inducing a pre-open state of the channel. The
pre-open state exhibits a conformation that is intermediate between the closed
conformation and the open conformation of the constitutively active mutant. The
resultant structural picture is compatible with 'membrane delimited' activation
of GIRK channels by G proteins and the characteristic burst kinetics of channel
gating. The structures also permit a conceptual understanding of how the
signalling lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and intracellular
Na(+) ions participate in multi-ligand regulation of GIRK channels.

Electronic properties such as current flow are generally independent of the
electron's spin angular momentum, an internal degree of freedom possessed by
quantum particles. The spin Hall effect, first proposed 40 years ago, is an
unusual class of phenomena in which flowing particles experience orthogonally
directed, spin-dependent forces--analogous to the conventional Lorentz force that
gives the Hall effect, but opposite in sign for two spin states. Spin Hall
effects have been observed for electrons flowing in spin-orbit-coupled materials 
such as GaAs and InGaAs (refs 2, 3) and for laser light traversing dielectric
junctions. Here we observe the spin Hall effect in a quantum-degenerate Bose gas,
and use the resulting spin-dependent Lorentz forces to realize a cold-atom spin
transistor. By engineering a spatially inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling field
for our quantum gas, we explicitly introduce and measure the requisite
spin-dependent Lorentz forces, finding them to be in excellent agreement with our
calculations. This 'atomtronic' transistor behaves as a type of
velocity-insensitive adiabatic spin selector, with potential application in
devices such as magnetic or inertial sensors. In addition, such techniques for
creating and measuring the spin Hall effect are clear prerequisites for
engineering topological insulators and detecting their associated quantized spin 
Hall effects in quantum gases. As implemented, our system realizes a
laser-actuated analogue to the archetypal semiconductor spintronic device, the
Datta-Das spin transistor.

A temporal cloak at telecommunication data rate.

Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA.

Through advances in metamaterials--artificially engineered media with exotic
properties, including negative refractive index--the once fanciful invisibility
cloak has now assumed a prominent place in scientific research. By extending
these concepts to the temporal domain, investigators have recently described a
cloak which hides events in time by creating a temporal gap in a probe beam that 
is subsequently closed up; any interaction which takes place during this hole in 
time is not detected. However, these results are limited to isolated events that 
fill a tiny portion of the temporal period, giving a fractional cloaking window
of only about 10(-4) per cent at a repetition rate of 41 kilohertz (ref.
15)--which is much too low for applications such as optical communications. Here 
we demonstrate another technique for temporal cloaking, which operates at
telecommunication data rates and, by exploiting temporal self-imaging through the
Talbot effect, hides optical data from a receiver. We succeed in cloaking 46 per 
cent of the entire time axis and conceal pseudorandom digital data at a rate of
12.7 gigabits per second. This potential to cloak real-world messages introduces 
temporal cloaking into the sphere of practical application, with immediate
ramifications in secure communications.

Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that controls the
pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells have largely focused on the roles of
transcription, chromatin and non-coding RNA regulators. Alternative splicing
represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in regulating
ES-cell pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here we identify
the muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and
direct negative regulators of a large program of cassette exon alternative
splicing events that are differentially regulated between ES cells and other cell
types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated cells causes switching to an 
ES-cell-like alternative splicing pattern for approximately half of these events,
whereas overexpression of MBNL proteins in ES cells promotes
differentiated-cell-like alternative splicing patterns. Among the MBNL-regulated 
events is an ES-cell-specific alternative splicing switch in the forkhead family 
transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency. Consistent with a central 
and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in pluripotency, their knockdown
significantly enhances the expression of key pluripotency genes and the formation
of induced pluripotent stem cells during somatic cell reprogramming.

DNA damage activates a signalling network that blocks cell-cycle progression,
recruits DNA repair factors and/or triggers senescence or programmed cell death. 
Alterations in chromatin structure are implicated in the initiation and
propagation of the DNA damage response. Here we further investigate the role of
chromatin structure in the DNA damage response by monitoring
ionizing-radiation-induced signalling and response events with a high-content
multiplex RNA-mediated interference screen of chromatin-modifying and
-interacting genes. We discover that an isoform of Brd4, a bromodomain and
extra-terminal (BET) family member, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of DNA
damage response signalling by recruiting the condensin II chromatin remodelling
complex to acetylated histones through bromodomain interactions. Loss of this
isoform results in relaxed chromatin structure, rapid cell-cycle checkpoint
recovery and enhanced survival after irradiation, whereas functional gain of this
isoform compacted chromatin, attenuated DNA damage response signalling and
enhanced radiation-induced lethality. These data implicate Brd4, previously known
for its role in transcriptional control, as an insulator of chromatin that can
modulate the signalling response to DNA damage.

Defining mechanisms by which Plasmodium virulence is regulated is central to
understanding the pathogenesis of human malaria. Serial blood passage of
Plasmodium through rodents, primates or humans increases parasite virulence,
suggesting that vector transmission regulates Plasmodium virulence within the
mammalian host. In agreement, disease severity can be modified by vector
transmission, which is assumed to 'reset' Plasmodium to its original character.
However, direct evidence that vector transmission regulates Plasmodium virulence 
is lacking. Here we use mosquito transmission of serially blood passaged (SBP)
Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi to interrogate regulation of parasite virulence.
Analysis of SBP P. c. chabaudi before and after mosquito transmission
demonstrates that vector transmission intrinsically modifies the asexual
blood-stage parasite, which in turn modifies the elicited mammalian immune
response, which in turn attenuates parasite growth and associated pathology.
Attenuated parasite virulence associates with modified expression of the pir
multi-gene family. Vector transmission of Plasmodium therefore regulates gene
expression of probable variant antigens in the erythrocytic cycle, modifies the
elicited mammalian immune response, and thus regulates parasite virulence. These 
results place the mosquito at the centre of our efforts to dissect mechanisms of 
protective immunity to malaria for the development of an effective vaccine.

The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is the final stage of nuclear burning for
low-mass stars. Although Milky Way globular clusters are now known to harbour (at
least) two generations of stars, they still provide relatively homogeneous
samples of stars that are used to constrain stellar evolution theory. It is
predicted by stellar models that the majority of cluster stars with masses around
the current turn-off mass (that is, the mass of the stars that are currently
leaving the main sequence phase) will evolve through the AGB phase. Here we
report that all of the second-generation stars in the globular cluster NGC
6752--70 per cent of the cluster population--fail to reach the AGB phase. Through
spectroscopic abundance measurements, we found that every AGB star in our sample 
has a low sodium abundance, indicating that they are exclusively first-generation
stars. This implies that many clusters cannot reliably be used for star counts to
test stellar evolution timescales if the AGB population is included. We have no
clear explanation for this observation.

The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has critical roles in immune signalling,
but how mutations in SHP-1 cause inflammatory disease in humans remains poorly
defined. Mice homozygous for the Tyr208Asn amino acid substitution in the carboxy
terminus of SHP-1 (referred to as Ptpn6(spin) mice) spontaneously develop a
severe inflammatory syndrome that resembles neutrophilic dermatosis in humans and
is characterized by persistent footpad swelling and suppurative inflammation.
Here we report that receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)-regulated interleukin
(IL)-1α production by haematopoietic cells critically mediates chronic
inflammatory disease in Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas inflammasome signalling and
IL-1β-mediated events are dispensable. IL-1α was also crucial for exacerbated
inflammatory responses and unremitting tissue damage upon footpad microabrasion
of Ptpn6(spin) mice. Notably, pharmacological and genetic blockade of the kinase 
RIP1 protected against wound-induced inflammation and tissue damage in
Ptpn6(spin) mice, whereas RIP3 deletion failed to do so. Moreover, RIP1-mediated 
inflammatory cytokine production was attenuated by NF-κB and ERK inhibition.
Together, our results indicate that wound-induced tissue damage and chronic
inflammation in Ptpn6(spin) mice are critically dependent on RIP1-mediated IL-1α 
production, whereas inflammasome signalling and RIP3-mediated necroptosis are
dispensable. Thus, we have unravelled a novel inflammatory circuit in which
RIP1-mediated IL-1α secretion in response to deregulated SHP-1 activity triggers 
an inflammatory destructive disease that proceeds independently of inflammasomes 
and programmed necrosis.

Early-life dietary transitions reflect fundamental aspects of primate evolution
and are important determinants of health in contemporary human populations.
Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates; early weaning can
have detrimental health effects but enables shorter inter-birth intervals, which 
influences population growth. Uncovering early-life dietary history in fossils is
hampered by the absence of prospectively validated biomarkers that are not
modified during fossilization. Here we show that large dietary shifts in early
life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues. Teeth from human
children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories,
demonstrate that barium (Ba) distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions
from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process. We also
document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which
shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven
months of supplementation. After this point, Ba levels in enamel returned to
baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at
1.2 years of age. Integration of Ba spatial distributions and histological
mapping of tooth formation enables novel studies of the evolution of human life
history, dietary ontogeny in wild primates, and human health investigations
through accurate reconstructions of breastfeeding history.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants of
modest-effect size at hundreds of loci for common autoimmune diseases; however, a
substantial fraction of heritability remains unexplained, to which rare variants 
may contribute. To discover rare variants and test them for association with a
phenotype, most studies re-sequence a small initial sample size and then genotype
the discovered variants in a larger sample set. This approach fails to analyse a 
large fraction of the rare variants present in the entire sample set. Here we
perform simultaneous amplicon-sequencing-based variant discovery and genotyping
for coding exons of 25 GWAS risk genes in 41,911 UK residents of white European
origin, comprising 24,892 subjects with six autoimmune disease phenotypes and
17,019 controls, and show that rare coding-region variants at known loci have a
negligible role in common autoimmune disease susceptibility. These results do not
support the rare-variant synthetic genome-wide-association hypothesis (in which
unobserved rare causal variants lead to association detected at common tag
variants). Many known autoimmune disease risk loci contain multiple,
independently associated, common and low-frequency variants, and so genes at
these loci are a priori stronger candidates for harbouring rare coding-region
variants than other genes. Our data indicate that the missing heritability for
common autoimmune diseases may not be attributable to the rare coding-region
variant portion of the allelic spectrum, but perhaps, as others have proposed,
may be a result of many common-variant loci of weak effect.

Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly
homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in
gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional 
consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically
measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic
profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here 
we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of
mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find 
extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA
abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ
hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes
are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very
highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns
demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of 
the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known
maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key 
regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable,
yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we
show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon
feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our
study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering
functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most frequent birth defect, affecting 0.8% 
of live births. Many cases occur sporadically and impair reproductive fitness,
suggesting a role for de novo mutations. Here we compare the incidence of de novo
mutations in 362 severe CHD cases and 264 controls by analysing exome sequencing 
of parent-offspring trios. CHD cases show a significant excess of
protein-altering de novo mutations in genes expressed in the developing heart,
with an odds ratio of 7.5 for damaging (premature termination, frameshift, splice
site) mutations. Similar odds ratios are seen across the main classes of severe
CHD. We find a marked excess of de novo mutations in genes involved in the
production, removal or reading of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, or
ubiquitination of H2BK120, which is required for H3K4 methylation. There are also
two de novo mutations in SMAD2, which regulates H3K27 methylation in the
embryonic left-right organizer. The combination of both activating (H3K4
methylation) and inactivating (H3K27 methylation) chromatin marks characterizes
'poised' promoters and enhancers, which regulate expression of key developmental 
genes. These findings implicate de novo point mutations in several hundreds of
genes that collectively contribute to approximately 10% of severe CHD.

Adult stem cells undergo asymmetric cell division to self-renew and give rise to 
differentiated cells that comprise mature tissue. Sister chromatids may be
distinguished and segregated nonrandomly in asymmetrically dividing stem cells,
although the underlying mechanism and the purpose it may serve remain elusive.
Here we develop the CO-FISH (chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ
hybridization) technique with single-chromosome resolution and show that sister
chromatids of X and Y chromosomes, but not autosomes, are segregated nonrandomly 
during asymmetric divisions of Drosophila male germline stem cells. This provides
the first direct evidence, to our knowledge, that two sister chromatids
containing identical genetic information can be distinguished and segregated
nonrandomly during asymmetric stem-cell divisions. We further show that the
centrosome, SUN-KASH nuclear envelope proteins and Dnmt2 (also known as Mt2) are 
required for nonrandom sister chromatid segregation. Our data indicate that the
information on X and Y chromosomes that enables nonrandom segregation is primed
during gametogenesis in the parents. Moreover, we show that sister chromatid
segregation is randomized in germline stem cell overproliferation and
dedifferentiated germline stem cells. We propose that nonrandom sister chromatid 
segregation may serve to transmit distinct information carried on two sister
chromatids to the daughters of asymmetrically dividing stem cells.

Understanding the growth rate of the continental crust through time is a
fundamental issue in Earth sciences. The isotopic signatures of noble gases in
the silicate Earth (mantle, crust) and in the atmosphere afford exceptional
insight into the evolution through time of these geochemical reservoirs. However,
no data for the compositions of these reservoirs exists for the distant past, and
temporal exchange rates between Earth's interior and its surface are severely
under-constrained owing to a lack of samples preserving the original signature of
the atmosphere at the time of their formation. Here, we report the analysis of
argon in Archaean (3.5-billion-year-old) hydrothermal quartz. Noble gases are
hosted in primary fluid inclusions containing a mixture of Archaean freshwater
and hydrothermal fluid. Our analysis reveals Archaean atmospheric argon with a
(40)Ar/(36)Ar value of 143 ± 24, lower than the present-day value of 298.6 (for
which (40)Ar has been produced by the radioactive decay of the potassium isotope 
(40)K, with a half-life of 1.25 billion years; (36)Ar is primordial in origin).
This ratio is consistent with an early development of the felsic crust, which
might have had an important role in climate variability during the first half of 
Earth's history.

Visualizing individual molecules with chemical recognition is a longstanding
target in catalysis, molecular nanotechnology and biotechnology. Molecular
vibrations provide a valuable 'fingerprint' for such identification. Vibrational 
spectroscopy based on tip-enhanced Raman scattering allows us to access the
spectral signals of molecular species very efficiently via the strong localized
plasmonic fields produced at the tip apex. However, the best spatial resolution
of the tip-enhanced Raman scattering imaging is still limited to 3-15 nanometres,
which is not adequate for resolving a single molecule chemically. Here we
demonstrate Raman spectral imaging with spatial resolution below one nanometre,
resolving the inner structure and surface configuration of a single molecule.
This is achieved by spectrally matching the resonance of the nanocavity plasmon
to the molecular vibronic transitions, particularly the downward transition
responsible for the emission of Raman photons. This matching is made possible by 
the extremely precise tuning capability provided by scanning tunnelling
microscopy. Experimental evidence suggests that the highly confined and broadband
nature of the nanocavity plasmon field in the tunnelling gap is essential for
ultrahigh-resolution imaging through the generation of an efficient
double-resonance enhancement for both Raman excitation and Raman emission. Our
technique not only allows for chemical imaging at the single-molecule level, but 
also offers a new way to study the optical processes and photochemistry of a
single molecule.

Close to optimal doping, the copper oxide superconductors show 'strange metal'
behaviour, suggestive of strong fluctuations associated with a quantum critical
point. Such a critical point requires a line of classical phase transitions
terminating at zero temperature near optimal doping inside the superconducting
'dome'. The underdoped region of the temperature-doping phase diagram from which 
superconductivity emerges is referred to as the 'pseudogap' because evidence
exists for partial gapping of the conduction electrons, but so far there is no
compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap is a distinct phase
or a continuous evolution of physical properties on cooling. Here we report that 
the pseudogap in YBa2Cu3O6+δ is a distinct phase, bounded by a line of phase
transitions. The doping dependence of this line is such that it terminates at
zero temperature inside the superconducting dome. From this we conclude that
quantum criticality drives the strange metallic behaviour and therefore
superconductivity in the copper oxide superconductors.

Reconstructing the earliest phases of primate evolution has been impeded by gaps 
in the fossil record, so that disagreements persist regarding the palaeobiology
and phylogenetic relationships of the earliest primates. Here we report the
discovery of a nearly complete and partly articulated skeleton of a primitive
haplorhine primate from the early Eocene of China, about 55 million years ago,
the oldest fossil primate of this quality ever recovered. Coupled with detailed
morphological examination using propagation phase contrast X-ray synchrotron
microtomography, our phylogenetic analysis based on total available evidence
indicates that this fossil is the most basal known member of the tarsiiform
clade. In addition to providing further support for an early dichotomy between
the strepsirrhine and haplorhine clades, this new primate further constrains the 
age of divergence between tarsiiforms and anthropoids. It also strengthens the
hypothesis that the earliest primates were probably diurnal, arboreal and
primarily insectivorous mammals the size of modern pygmy mouse lemurs.

Since the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment
Report, new observations of ice-sheet mass balance and improved computer
simulations of ice-sheet response to continuing climate change have been
published. Whereas Greenland is losing ice mass at an increasing pace, current
Antarctic ice loss is likely to be less than some recently published estimates.
It remains unclear whether East Antarctica has been gaining or losing ice mass
over the past 20 years, and uncertainties in ice-mass change for West Antarctica 
and the Antarctic Peninsula remain large. We discuss the past six years of
progress and examine the key problems that remain.

Cholesterol is a structural component of the cell and is indispensable for normal
cellular function, although its excess often leads to abnormal proliferation,
migration, inflammatory responses and/or cell death. To prevent cholesterol
overload, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate cholesterol efflux from
the cells to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and the apoA-I-containing high-density
lipoprotein (HDL). Maintaining efficient cholesterol efflux is essential for
normal cellular function. However, the role of cholesterol efflux in angiogenesis
and the identity of its local regulators are poorly understood. Here we show that
apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) accelerates cholesterol efflux from endothelial
cells to HDL and thereby regulates angiogenesis. AIBP- and HDL-mediated
cholesterol depletion reduces lipid rafts, interferes with VEGFR2 (also known as 
KDR) dimerization and signalling and inhibits vascular endothelial growth
factor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and mouse aortic neovascularization ex vivo.
Notably, Aibp, a zebrafish homologue of human AIBP, regulates the membrane lipid 
order in embryonic zebrafish vasculature and functions as a non-cell-autonomous
regulator of angiogenesis. aibp knockdown results in dysregulated
sprouting/branching angiogenesis, whereas forced Aibp expression inhibits
angiogenesis. Dysregulated angiogenesis is phenocopied in Abca1 (also known as
Abca1a) Abcg1-deficient embryos, and cholesterol levels are increased in
Aibp-deficient and Abca1 Abcg1-deficient embryos. Our findings demonstrate that
secreted AIBP positively regulates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells and 
that effective cholesterol efflux is critical for proper angiogenesis.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a result of complex gene-environment interactions, and
several risk factors have been identified, including age, family history, diet,
sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Statistical models that combine known risk
factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the
disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics
contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental
factors have greater influence. Recent evidence suggests the importance of the
gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been
linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 
145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe 
compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D,
and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified
T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose
tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like
metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have
major confounding effects. We also applied our model to a recently described
Chinese cohort and show that the discriminant metagenomic markers for T2D differ 
between the European and Chinese cohorts. Therefore, metagenomic predictive tools
for T2D should be specific for the age and geographical location of the
populations studied.

Human language, as well as birdsong, relies on the ability to arrange vocal
elements in new sequences. However, little is known about the ontogenetic origin 
of this capacity. Here we track the development of vocal combinatorial capacity
in three species of vocal learners, combining an experimental approach in zebra
finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with an analysis of natural development of vocal
transitions in Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and pre-lingual
human infants. We find a common, stepwise pattern of acquiring vocal transitions 
across species. In our first study, juvenile zebra finches were trained to
perform one song and then the training target was altered, prompting the birds to
swap syllable order, or insert a new syllable into a string. All birds solved
these permutation tasks in a series of steps, gradually approximating the target 
sequence by acquiring new pairwise syllable transitions, sometimes too slowly to 
accomplish the task fully. Similarly, in the more complex songs of Bengalese
finches, branching points and bidirectional transitions in song syntax were
acquired in a stepwise fashion, starting from a more restrictive set of vocal
transitions. The babbling of pre-lingual human infants showed a similar pattern: 
instead of a single developmental shift from reduplicated to variegated babbling 
(that is, from repetitive to diverse sequences), we observed multiple shifts,
where each new syllable type slowly acquired a diversity of pairwise transitions,
asynchronously over development. Collectively, these results point to a common
generative process that is conserved across species, suggesting that the
long-noted gap between perceptual versus motor combinatorial capabilities in
human infants may arise partly from the challenges in constructing new pairwise
vocal transitions.

The detection of DNA lesions within chromatin represents a critical step in
cellular responses to DNA damage. However, the regulatory mechanisms that couple 
chromatin sensing to DNA-damage signalling in mammalian cells are not well
understood. Here we show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein
acetyltransferase KAT5 (also known as TIP60) increases after DNA damage in a
manner that promotes KAT5 binding to the histone mark H3K9me3. This triggers
KAT5-mediated acetylation of the ATM kinase, promoting DNA-damage-checkpoint
activation and cell survival. We also establish that chromatin alterations can
themselves enhance KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and ATM-dependent signalling,
and identify the proto-oncogene c-Abl as a mediator of this modification. These
findings define KAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation as a key event in the sensing of
genomic and chromatin perturbations, and highlight a key role for c-Abl in such
processes.

Fusing left and right eye images into a single view is dependent on precise
ocular alignment, which relies on coordinated eye movements. During movements of 
the head this alignment is maintained by numerous reflexes. Although rodents
share with other mammals the key components of eye movement control, the
coordination of eye movements in freely moving rodents is unknown. Here we show
that movements of the two eyes in freely moving rats differ fundamentally from
the precisely controlled eye movements used by other mammals to maintain
continuous binocular fusion. The observed eye movements serve to keep the visual 
fields of the two eyes continuously overlapping above the animal during free
movement, but not continuously aligned. Overhead visual stimuli presented to rats
freely exploring an open arena evoke an immediate shelter-seeking behaviour, but 
are ineffective when presented beside the arena. We suggest that continuously
overlapping visual fields overhead would be of evolutionary benefit for predator 
detection by minimizing blind spots.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently characterized family of immune cells 
that have critical roles in cytokine-mediated regulation of intestinal epithelial
cell barrier integrity. Alterations in ILC responses are associated with multiple
chronic human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, implicating a role 
for ILCs in disease pathogenesis. Owing to an inability to target ILCs
selectively, experimental studies assessing ILC function have predominantly used 
mice lacking adaptive immune cells. However, in lymphocyte-sufficient hosts ILCs 
are vastly outnumbered by CD4(+) T cells, which express similar profiles of
effector cytokines. Therefore, the function of ILCs in the presence of adaptive
immunity and their potential to influence adaptive immune cell responses remain
unknown. To test this, we used genetic or antibody-mediated depletion strategies 
to target murine ILCs in the presence of an adaptive immune system. We show that 
loss of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-γt-positive (RORγt(+))
ILCs was associated with dysregulated adaptive immune cell responses against
commensal bacteria and low-grade systemic inflammation. Remarkably, ILC-mediated 
regulation of adaptive immune cells occurred independently of interleukin
(IL)-17A, IL-22 or IL-23. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling and functional
analyses revealed that RORγt(+) ILCs express major histocompatibility complex
class II (MHCII) and can process and present antigen. However, rather than
inducing T-cell proliferation, ILCs acted to limit commensal bacteria-specific
CD4(+) T-cell responses. Consistent with this, selective deletion of MHCII in
murine RORγt(+) ILCs resulted in dysregulated commensal bacteria-dependent CD4(+)
T-cell responses that promoted spontaneous intestinal inflammation. These data
identify that ILCs maintain intestinal homeostasis through MHCII-dependent
interactions with CD4(+) T cells that limit pathological adaptive immune cell
responses to commensal bacteria.

In response to tenacious stress signals, such as the unscheduled activation of
oncogenes, cells can mobilize tumour suppressor networks to avert the hazard of
malignant transformation. A large body of evidence indicates that
oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) acts as such a break, withdrawing cells from
the proliferative pool almost irreversibly, thus crafting a vital
pathophysiological mechanism that protects against cancer. Despite the widespread
contribution of OIS to the cessation of tumorigenic expansion in animal models
and humans, we have only just begun to define the underlying mechanism and
identify key players. Although deregulation of metabolism is intimately linked to
the proliferative capacity of cells, and senescent cells are thought to remain
metabolically active, little has been investigated in detail about the role of
cellular metabolism in OIS. Here we show, by metabolic profiling and functional
perturbations, that the mitochondrial gatekeeper pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is 
a crucial mediator of senescence induced by BRAF(V600E), an oncogene commonly
mutated in melanoma and other cancers. BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence was
accompanied by simultaneous suppression of the PDH-inhibitory enzyme pyruvate
dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and induction of the PDH-activating enzyme pyruvate
dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2). The resulting combined activation of PDH
enhanced the use of pyruvate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, causing increased
respiration and redox stress. Abrogation of OIS, a rate-limiting step towards
oncogenic transformation, coincided with reversion of these processes. Further
supporting a crucial role of PDH in OIS, enforced normalization of either PDK1 or
PDP2 expression levels inhibited PDH and abrogated OIS, thereby licensing
BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma development. Finally, depletion of PDK1 eradicated
melanoma subpopulations resistant to targeted BRAF inhibition, and caused
regression of established melanomas. These results reveal a mechanistic
relationship between OIS and a key metabolic signalling axis, which may be
exploited therapeutically.

Superfluidity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon occurring in systems as diverse
as liquid helium and neutron stars. It occurs below a critical temperature and
leads to peculiar behaviour such as frictionless flow, the formation of quantized
vortices and quenching of the moment of inertia. Ultracold atomic gases offer
control of interactions and external confinement, providing unique opportunities 
to explore superfluid phenomena. Many such (finite-temperature) phenomena can be 
explained in terms of a two-fluid mixture comprising a normal component, which
behaves like an ordinary fluid, and a superfluid component with zero viscosity
and zero entropy. The two-component nature of a superfluid is manifest in 'second
sound', an entropy wave in which the superfluid and the non-superfluid components
oscillate with opposite phases (as opposed to ordinary 'first sound', where they 
oscillate in phase). Here we report the observation of second sound in an
ultracold Fermi gas with resonant interactions. The speed of second sound depends
explicitly on the value of the superfluid fraction, a quantity that is sensitive 
to the spectrum of elementary excitations. Our measurements allow us to extract
the temperature dependence of the superfluid fraction, a previously inaccessible 
quantity that will provide a benchmark for theories of strongly interacting
quantum gases.

Collective behaviour, arising from local interactions, allows groups to respond
to changing conditions. Long-term studies have shown that the traits of
individual mammals and birds are associated with their reproductive success, but 
little is known about the evolutionary ecology of collective behaviour in natural
populations. An ant colony operates without central control, regulating its
activity through a network of local interactions. This work shows that variation 
among harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) colonies in collective response to
changing conditions is related to variation in colony lifetime reproductive
success in the production of offspring colonies. Desiccation costs are high for
harvester ants foraging in the desert. More successful colonies tend to forage
less when conditions are dry, and show relatively stable foraging activity when
conditions are more humid. Restraint from foraging does not compromise a colony's
long-term survival; colonies that fail to forage at all on many days survive as
long, over the colony's 20-30-year lifespan, as those that forage more regularly.
Sensitivity to conditions in which to reduce foraging activity may be
transmissible from parent to offspring colony. These results indicate that
natural selection is shaping the collective behaviour that regulates foraging
activity, and that the selection pressure, related to climate, may grow stronger 
if the current drought in their habitat persists.

The identification of novel metabolites and the characterization of their
biological functions are major challenges in biology. X-ray crystallography can
reveal unanticipated ligands that persist through purification and
crystallization. These adventitious protein-ligand complexes provide insights
into new activities, pathways and regulatory mechanisms. We describe a new
metabolite, carboxy-S-adenosyl-l-methionine (Cx-SAM), its biosynthetic pathway
and its role in transfer RNA modification. The structure of CmoA, a member of the
SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily, revealed a ligand consistent with
Cx-SAM in the catalytic site. Mechanistic analyses showed an unprecedented role
for prephenate as the carboxyl donor and the involvement of a unique ylide
intermediate as the carboxyl acceptor in the CmoA-mediated conversion of SAM to
Cx-SAM. A second member of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase superfamily, CmoB,
recognizes Cx-SAM and acts as a carboxymethyltransferase to convert
5-hydroxyuridine into 5-oxyacetyl uridine at the wobble position of multiple
tRNAs in Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in expanded codon-recognition
properties. CmoA and CmoB represent the first documented synthase and transferase
for Cx-SAM. These findings reveal new functional diversity in the SAM-dependent
methyltransferase superfamily and expand the metabolic and biological
contributions of SAM-based biochemistry. These discoveries highlight the value of
structural genomics approaches in identifying ligands within the context of their
physiologically relevant macromolecular binding partners, and in revealing their 
functions.

It has been argued that the evolution of plant genome size is principally
unidirectional and increasing owing to the varied action of whole-genome
duplications (WGDs) and mobile element proliferation. However, extreme genome
size reductions have been reported in the angiosperm family tree. Here we report 
the sequence of the 82-megabase genome of the carnivorous bladderwort plant
Utricularia gibba. Despite its tiny size, the U. gibba genome accommodates a
typical number of genes for a plant, with the main difference from other plant
genomes arising from a drastic reduction in non-genic DNA. Unexpectedly, we
identified at least three rounds of WGD in U. gibba since common ancestry with
tomato (Solanum) and grape (Vitis). The compressed architecture of the U. gibba
genome indicates that a small fraction of intergenic DNA, with few or no active
retrotransposons, is sufficient to regulate and integrate all the processes
required for the development and reproduction of a complex organism.

Retroviral capsid proteins are conserved structurally but assemble into different
morphologies. The mature human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid is best
described by a 'fullerene cone' model, in which hexamers of the capsid protein
are linked to form a hexagonal surface lattice that is closed by incorporating 12
capsid-protein pentamers. HIV-1 capsid protein contains an amino-terminal domain 
(NTD) comprising seven α-helices and a β-hairpin, a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD)
comprising four α-helices, and a flexible linker with a 310-helix connecting the 
two structural domains. Structures of the capsid-protein assembly units have been
determined by X-ray crystallography; however, structural information regarding
the assembled capsid and the contacts between the assembly units is incomplete.
Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a tubular HIV-1
capsid-protein assembly at 8 Å resolution and the three-dimensional structure of 
a native HIV-1 core by cryo-electron tomography. The structure of the tubular
assembly shows, at the three-fold interface, a three-helix bundle with critical
hydrophobic interactions. Mutagenesis studies confirm that hydrophobic residues
in the centre of the three-helix bundle are crucial for capsid assembly and
stability, and for viral infectivity. The cryo-electron-microscopy structures
enable modelling by large-scale molecular dynamics simulation, resulting in
all-atom models for the hexamer-of-hexamer and pentamer-of-hexamer elements as
well as for the entire capsid. Incorporation of pentamers results in closer
trimer contacts and induces acute surface curvature. The complete atomic HIV-1
capsid model provides a platform for further studies of capsid function and for
targeted pharmacological intervention.

Understanding the origins of the diversity in terrestrial planets is a
fundamental goal in Earth and planetary sciences. In the Solar System, Venus has 
a similar size and bulk composition to those of Earth, but it lacks water.
Because a richer variety of exoplanets is expected to be discovered, prediction
of their atmospheres and surface environments requires a general framework for
planetary evolution. Here we show that terrestrial planets can be divided into
two distinct types on the basis of their evolutionary history during
solidification from the initially hot molten state expected from the standard
formation model. Even if, apart from their orbits, they were identical just after
formation, the solidified planets can have different characteristics. A type I
planet, which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star,
solidifies within several million years. If the planet acquires water during
formation, most of this water is retained and forms the earliest oceans. In
contrast, on a type II planet, which is formed inside the critical distance, a
magma ocean can be sustained for longer, even with a larger initial amount of
water. Its duration could be as long as 100 million years if the planet is formed
together with a mass of water comparable to the total inventory of the modern
Earth. Hydrodynamic escape desiccates type II planets during the slow
solidification process. Although Earth is categorized as type I, it is not clear 
which type Venus is because its orbital distance is close to the critical
distance. However, because the dryness of the surface and mantle predicted for
type II planets is consistent with the characteristics of Venus, it may be
representative of type II planets. Also, future observations may have a chance to
detect not only terrestrial exoplanets covered with water ocean but also those
covered with magma ocean around a young star.

Persistent export of 231Pa from the deep central Arctic Ocean over the past
35,000 years.

The Arctic Ocean has an important role in Earth's climate, both through surface
processes such as sea-ice formation and transport, and through the production and
export of waters at depth that contribute to the global thermohaline circulation.
Deciphering the deep Arctic Ocean's palaeo-oceanographic history is a crucial
part of understanding its role in climatic change. Here we show that sedimentary 
ratios of the radionuclides thorium-230 ((230)Th) and protactinium-231 ((231)Pa),
which are produced in sea water and removed by particle scavenging on timescales 
of decades to centuries, respectively, record consistent evidence for the export 
of (231)Pa from the deep Arctic and may indicate continuous deep-water exchange
between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans throughout the past 35,000 years. Seven
well-dated box-core records provide a comprehensive overview of (231)Pa and
(230)Th burial in Arctic sediments during glacial, deglacial and interglacial
conditions. Sedimentary (231)Pa/(230)Th ratios decrease nearly linearly with
increasing water depth above the core sites, indicating efficient particle
scavenging in the upper water column and greater influence of removal by lateral 
transport at depth. Although the measured (230)Th burial is in balance with its
production in Arctic sea water, integrated depth profiles for all time intervals 
reveal a deficit in (231)Pa burial that can be balanced only by lateral export in
the water column. Because no enhanced sink for (231)Pa has yet been found in the 
Arctic, our records suggest that deep-water exchange through the Fram strait may 
export (231)Pa. Such export may have continued for the past 35,000 years,
suggesting a century-scale replacement time for deep waters in the Arctic Ocean
since the most recent glaciation and a persistent contribution of Arctic waters
to the global ocean circulation.

Magnetars are neutron stars with X-ray and soft γ-ray outbursts thought to be
powered by intense internal magnetic fields. Like conventional neutron stars in
the form of radio pulsars, magnetars exhibit 'glitches' during which angular
momentum is believed to be transferred between the solid outer crust and the
superfluid component of the inner crust. The several hundred observed glitches in
radio pulsars and magnetars have involved a sudden spin-up (increase in the
angular velocity) of the star, presumably because the interior superfluid was
rotating faster than the crust. Here we report X-ray timing observations of the
magnetar 1E 2259+586 (ref. 8), which exhibited a clear 'anti-glitch'--a sudden
spin-down. We show that this event, like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches,
was accompanied by multiple X-ray radiative changes and a significant spin-down
rate change. Such behaviour is not predicted by models of neutron star spin-down 
and, if of internal origin, is suggestive of differential rotation in the
magnetar, supporting the need for a rethinking of glitch theory for all neutron
stars.

BAF complexes facilitate decatenation of DNA by topoisomerase IIα.

Recent exon-sequencing studies of human tumours have revealed that subunits of
BAF (mammalian SWI/SNF) complexes are mutated in more than 20% of all human
malignancies, but the mechanisms involved in tumour suppression are unclear. BAF 
chromatin-remodelling complexes are polymorphic assemblies that use energy
provided by ATP hydrolysis to regulate transcription through the control of
chromatin structure and the placement of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)
across the genome. Several proteins dedicated to this multisubunit complex,
including BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4) and BAF250a (also known as ARID1A), are
mutated at frequencies similar to those of recognized tumour suppressors. In
particular, the core ATPase BRG1 is mutated in 5-10% of childhood
medulloblastomas and more than 15% of Burkitt's lymphomas. Here we show a
previously unknown function of BAF complexes in decatenating newly replicated
sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during
mitosis. We find that deletion of Brg1 in mouse cells, as well as the expression 
of BRG1 point mutants identified in human tumours, leads to anaphase bridge
formation (in which sister chromatids are linked by catenated strands of DNA) and
a G2/M-phase block characteristic of the decatenation checkpoint. Endogenous BAF 
complexes interact directly with endogenous topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) through
BAF250a and are required for the binding of TOP2A to approximately 12,000 sites
across the genome. Our results demonstrate that TOP2A chromatin binding is
dependent on the ATPase activity of BRG1, which is compromised in oncogenic BRG1 
mutants. These studies indicate that the ability of TOP2A to prevent DNA
entanglement at mitosis requires BAF complexes and suggest that this activity
contributes to the role of BAF subunits as tumour suppressors.

The KRAS oncogene product is considered a major target in anticancer drug
discovery. However, direct interference with KRAS signalling has not yet led to
clinically useful drugs. Correct localization and signalling by farnesylated KRAS
is regulated by the prenyl-binding protein PDEδ, which sustains the spatial
organization of KRAS by facilitating its diffusion in the cytoplasm. Here we
report that interfering with binding of mammalian PDEδ to KRAS by means of small 
molecules provides a novel opportunity to suppress oncogenic RAS signalling by
altering its localization to endomembranes. Biochemical screening and subsequent 
structure-based hit optimization yielded inhibitors of the KRAS-PDEδ interaction 
that selectively bind to the prenyl-binding pocket of PDEδ with nanomolar
affinity, inhibit oncogenic RAS signalling and suppress in vitro and in vivo
proliferation of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells that are dependent 
on oncogenic KRAS. Our findings may inspire novel drug discovery efforts aimed at
the development of drugs targeting oncogenic RAS.

Conifers have dominated forests for more than 200 million years and are of huge
ecological and economic importance. Here we present the draft assembly of the
20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any
gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the >100
times smaller genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, and there is no evidence of a
recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large
genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse
set of long-terminal repeat transposable elements, possibly owing to the lack of 
an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris,
Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that 
the transposable element diversity is shared among extant conifers. Expression of
24-nucleotide small RNAs, previously implicated in transposable element
silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further
identify numerous long (>10,000 base pairs) introns, gene-like fragments,
uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs and short RNAs. This opens up new genomic
avenues for conifer forestry and breeding.

The importance of mixed selectivity in complex cognitive tasks.

Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of
multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous,
seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural
activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a 
role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the
PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about 
all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of
neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover,
mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized
responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by
readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear
selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of
high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is
predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings
recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily
interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed 
selectivity neurons.

A central goal of synthetic biology is to achieve multi-signal integration and
processing in living cells for diagnostic, therapeutic and biotechnology
applications. Digital logic has been used to build small-scale circuits, but
other frameworks may be needed for efficient computation in the resource-limited 
environments of cells. Here we demonstrate that synthetic analog gene circuits
can be engineered to execute sophisticated computational functions in living
cells using just three transcription factors. Such synthetic analog gene circuits
exploit feedback to implement logarithmically linear sensing, addition,
ratiometric and power-law computations. The circuits exhibit Weber's law
behaviour as in natural biological systems, operate over a wide dynamic range of 
up to four orders of magnitude and can be designed to have tunable transfer
functions. Our circuits can be composed to implement higher-order functions that 
are well described by both intricate biochemical models and simple mathematical
functions. By exploiting analog building-block functions that are already
naturally present in cells, this approach efficiently implements arithmetic
operations and complex functions in the logarithmic domain. Such circuits may
lead to new applications for synthetic biology and biotechnology that require
complex computations with limited parts, need wide-dynamic-range biosensing or
would benefit from the fine control of gene expression.

Apes and Old World monkeys are prominent components of modern African and Asian
ecosystems, yet the earliest phases of their evolutionary history have remained
largely undocumented. The absence of crown catarrhine fossils older than
∼20 million years (Myr) has stood in stark contrast to molecular divergence
estimates of ∼25-30 Myr for the split between Cercopithecoidea (Old World
monkeys) and Hominoidea (apes), implying long ghost lineages for both clades.
Here we describe the oldest known fossil 'ape', represented by a partial mandible
preserving dental features that place it with 'nyanzapithecine' stem hominoids.
Additionally, we report the oldest stem member of the Old World monkey clade,
represented by a lower third molar. Both specimens were recovered from a
precisely dated 25.2-Myr-old stratum in the Rukwa Rift, a segment of the western 
branch of the East African Rift in Tanzania. These finds extend the fossil record
of apes and Old World monkeys well into the Oligocene epoch of Africa, suggesting
a possible link between diversification of crown catarrhines and changes in the
African landscape brought about by previously unrecognized tectonic activity in
the East African rift system.

Superlattices have attracted great interest because their use may make it
possible to modify the spectra of two-dimensional electron systems and,
ultimately, create materials with tailored electronic properties. In previous
studies (see, for example, refs 1-8), it proved difficult to realize
superlattices with short periodicities and weak disorder, and most of their
observed features could be explained in terms of cyclotron orbits commensurate
with the superlattice. Evidence for the formation of superlattice minibands
(forming a fractal spectrum known as Hofstadter's butterfly) has been limited to 
the observation of new low-field oscillations and an internal structure within
Landau levels. Here we report transport properties of graphene placed on a boron 
nitride substrate and accurately aligned along its crystallographic directions.
The substrate's moiré potential acts as a superlattice and leads to profound
changes in the graphene's electronic spectrum. Second-generation Dirac points
appear as pronounced peaks in resistivity, accompanied by reversal of the Hall
effect. The latter indicates that the effective sign of the charge carriers
changes within graphene's conduction and valence bands. Strong magnetic fields
lead to Zak-type cloning of the third generation of Dirac points, which are
observed as numerous neutrality points in fields where a unit fraction of the
flux quantum pierces the superlattice unit cell. Graphene superlattices such as
this one provide a way of studying the rich physics expected in incommensurable
quantum systems and illustrate the possibility of controllably modifying the
electronic spectra of two-dimensional atomic crystals by varying their
crystallographic alignment within van der Waals heterostuctures.

superlattices.

Electrons moving through a spatially periodic lattice potential develop a
quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two dimensions, 
electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized energy
spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. When subject to
both a magnetic field and a periodic electrostatic potential, two-dimensional
systems of electrons exhibit a self-similar recursive energy spectrum. Known as
Hofstadter's butterfly, this complex spectrum results from an interplay between
the characteristic lengths associated with the two quantizing fields, and is one 
of the first quantum fractals discovered in physics. In the decades since its
prediction, experimental attempts to study this effect have been limited by
difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical atomic lattices (with 
periodicities of less than one nanometre) require unfeasibly large magnetic
fields to reach the commensurability condition, and in artificially engineered
structures (with periodicities greater than about 100 nanometres) the
corresponding fields are too small to overcome disorder completely. Here we
demonstrate that moiré superlattices arising in bilayer graphene coupled to
hexagonal boron nitride provide a periodic modulation with ideal length scales of
the order of ten nanometres, enabling unprecedented experimental access to the
fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall features associated with the
fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers, and report
evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of a Hofstadter spectrum in
bilayer graphene means that it is possible to investigate emergent behaviour
within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal degrees of
freedom.

Long-term warming restructures Arctic tundra without changing net soil carbon
storage.

High latitudes contain nearly half of global soil carbon, prompting interest in
understanding how the Arctic terrestrial carbon balance will respond to rising
temperatures. Low temperatures suppress the activity of soil biota, retarding
decomposition and nitrogen release, which limits plant and microbial growth.
Warming initially accelerates decomposition, increasing nitrogen availability,
productivity and woody-plant dominance. However, these responses may be
transitory, because coupled abiotic-biotic feedback loops that alter
soil-temperature dynamics and change the structure and activity of soil
communities, can develop. Here we report the results of a two-decade summer
warming experiment in an Alaskan tundra ecosystem. Warming increased plant
biomass and woody dominance, indirectly increased winter soil temperature,
homogenized the soil trophic structure across horizons and suppressed
surface-soil-decomposer activity, but did not change total soil carbon or
nitrogen stocks, thereby increasing net ecosystem carbon storage. Notably, the
strongest effects were in the mineral horizon, where warming increased decomposer
activity and carbon stock: a 'biotic awakening' at depth.

Macropinocytosis is a highly conserved endocytic process by which extracellular
fluid and its contents are internalized into cells through large, heterogeneous
vesicles known as macropinosomes. Oncogenic Ras proteins have been shown to
stimulate macropinocytosis but the functional contribution of this uptake
mechanism to the transformed phenotype remains unknown. Here we show that
Ras-transformed cells use macropinocytosis to transport extracellular protein
into the cell. The internalized protein undergoes proteolytic degradation,
yielding amino acids including glutamine that can enter central carbon
metabolism. Accordingly, the dependence of Ras-transformed cells on free
extracellular glutamine for growth can be suppressed by the macropinocytic uptake
of protein. Consistent with macropinocytosis representing an important route of
nutrient uptake in tumours, its pharmacological inhibition compromises the growth
of Ras-transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts. These results identify
macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which cancer cells support their unique
metabolic needs and point to the possible exploitation of this process in the
design of anticancer therapies.

Mineral nitrogen in nature is often found in the form of nitrate (NO3(-)).
Numerous microorganisms evolved to assimilate nitrate and use it as a major
source of mineral nitrogen uptake. Nitrate, which is central in nitrogen
metabolism, is first reduced to nitrite (NO2(-)) through a two-electron reduction
reaction. The accumulation of cellular nitrite can be harmful because nitrite can
be reduced to the cytotoxic nitric oxide. Instead, nitrite is rapidly removed
from the cell by channels and transporters, or reduced to ammonium or dinitrogen 
through the action of assimilatory enzymes. Despite decades of effort no
structure is currently available for any nitrate transport protein and the
mechanism by which nitrate is transported remains largely unknown. Here we report
the structure of a bacterial nitrate/nitrite transport protein, NarK, from
Escherichia coli, with and without substrate. The structures reveal a positively 
charged substrate-translocation pathway lacking protonatable residues, suggesting
that NarK functions as a nitrate/nitrite exchanger and that protons are unlikely 
to be co-transported. Conserved arginine residues comprise the substrate-binding 
pocket, which is formed by association of helices from the two halves of NarK.
Key residues that are important for substrate recognition and transport are
identified and related to extensive mutagenesis and functional studies. We
propose that NarK exchanges nitrate for nitrite by a rocker switch mechanism
facilitated by inter-domain hydrogen bond networks.

The ability of signalling proteins to traverse tissues containing tightly packed 
cells is of fundamental importance for cell specification and tissue development;
however, how this is achieved at a cellular level remains poorly understood. For 
more than a century, the vertebrate limb bud has served as a model for studying
cell signalling during embryonic development. Here we optimize single-cell
real-time imaging to delineate the cellular mechanisms for how signalling
proteins, such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), that possess membrane-bound covalent
lipid modifications traverse long distances within the vertebrate limb bud in
vivo. By directly imaging SHH ligand production under native regulatory control
in chick (Gallus gallus) embryos, our findings show that SHH is unexpectedly
produced in the form of a particle that remains associated with the cell via long
cytoplasmic extensions that span several cell diameters. We show that these
cellular extensions are a specialized class of actin-based filopodia with novel
cytoskeletal features that have not been previously described. Notably, particles
containing SHH travel along these extensions with a net anterograde movement
within the field of SHH cell signalling. We further show that in SHH-responding
cells, specific subsets of SHH co-receptors, including cell adhesion molecule
downregulated by oncogenes (CDO) and brother of CDO (BOC), actively distribute
and co-localize in specific micro-domains within filopodial extensions, far from 
the cell body. Stabilized interactions are formed between filopodia containing
SHH ligand and those containing co-receptors over a long range. These results
suggest that contact-mediated release propagated by specialized filopodia
contributes to the delivery of SHH at a distance. Together, these studies
identify an important mode of communication between cells that considerably
extends our understanding of ligand movement and reception during vertebrate
tissue patterning.

Weakened stratospheric quasibiennial oscillation driven by increased tropical
mean upwelling.

The zonal wind in the tropical stratosphere switches between prevailing
easterlies and westerlies with a period of about 28 months. In the lowermost
stratosphere, the vertical structure of this quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) is
linked to the mean upwelling, which itself is a key factor in determining
stratospheric composition. Evidence for changes in the QBO have until now been
equivocal, raising questions as to the extent of stratospheric circulation
changes in a global warming context. Here we report an analysis of
near-equatorial radiosonde observations for 1953-2012, and reveal a long-term
trend of weakening amplitude in the zonal wind QBO in the tropical lower
stratosphere. The trend is particularly notable at the 70-hectopascal pressure
level (an altitude of about 19 kilometres), where the QBO amplitudes dropped by
roughly one-third over the period. This trend is also apparent in the global
warming simulations of the four models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) that realistically simulate the QBO. The weakening is
most reasonably explained as resulting from a trend of increased mean tropical
upwelling in the lower stratosphere. Almost all comprehensive climate models have
projected an intensifying tropical upwelling in global warming scenarios, but
attempts to estimate changes in the upwelling by using observational data have
yielded ambiguous, inconclusive or contradictory results. Our discovery of a
weakening trend in the lower-stratosphere QBO amplitude provides strong support
for the existence of a long-term trend of enhanced upwelling near the tropical
tropopause.

Chirality plays a fundamental part in the activity of biological molecules and
broad classes of chemical reactions, but detecting and quantifying it remains
challenging. The spectroscopic methods of choice are usually circular dichroism
and vibrational circular dichroism, methods that are forbidden in the electric
dipole approximation. The resultant weak effects produce weak signals, and thus
require high sample densities. In contrast, nonlinear techniques probing
electric-dipole-allowed effects have been used for sensitive chiral analyses of
liquid samples. Here we extend this class of approaches by carrying out nonlinear
resonant phase-sensitive microwave spectroscopy of gas phase samples in the
presence of an adiabatically switched non-resonant orthogonal electric field; we 
use this technique to map the enantiomer-dependent sign of an electric dipole
Rabi frequency onto the phase of emitted microwave radiation. We outline
theoretically how this results in a sensitive and species-selective method for
determining the chirality of cold gas-phase molecules, and implement it
experimentally to distinguish between the S and R enantiomers of 1,2-propanediol 
and their racemic mixture. This technique produces a large and definitive
signature of chirality, and has the potential to determine the chirality of
multiple species in a mixture.

All-angle negative refraction and active flat lensing of ultraviolet light.

and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, USA.

Decades ago, Veselago predicted that a material with simultaneously negative
electric and magnetic polarization responses would yield a 'left-handed' medium
in which light propagates with opposite phase and energy velocities--a condition 
described by a negative refractive index. He proposed that a flat slab of
left-handed material possessing an isotropic refractive index of -1 could act
like an imaging lens in free space. Left-handed materials do not occur naturally,
and it has only recently become possible to achieve a left-handed response using 
metamaterials, that is, electromagnetic structures engineered on subwavelength
scales to elicit tailored polarization responses. So far, left-handed responses
have typically been implemented using resonant metamaterials composed of periodic
arrays of unit cells containing inductive-capacitive resonators and conductive
wires. Negative refractive indices that are isotropic in two or three dimensions 
at microwave frequencies have been achieved in resonant metamaterials with
centimetre-scale features. Scaling the left-handed response to higher
frequencies, such as infrared or visible, has been done by shrinking critical
dimensions to submicrometre scales by means of top-down nanofabrication. This
miniaturization has, however, so far been achieved at the cost of reduced
unit-cell symmetry, yielding a refractive index that is negative along only one
axis. Moreover, lithographic scaling limits have so far precluded the fabrication
of resonant metamaterials with left-handed responses at frequencies beyond the
visible. Here we report the experimental implementation of a bulk metamaterial
with a left-handed response to ultraviolet light. The structure, based on stacked
plasmonic waveguides, yields an omnidirectional left-handed response for
transverse magnetic polarization characterized by a negative refractive index. By
engineering the structure to have a refractive index close to -1 over a broad
angular range, we achieve Veselago flat lensing, in free space, of arbitrarily
shaped, two-dimensional objects beyond the near field. We further demonstrate
active, all-optical modulation of the image transferred by the flat lens.

The idea of 'frozen-in' magnetic field lines for ideal plasmas is useful to
explain diverse astrophysical phenomena, for example the shedding of excess
angular momentum from protostars by twisting of field lines frozen into the
interstellar medium. Frozen-in field lines, however, preclude the rapid changes
in magnetic topology observed at high conductivities, as in solar flares.
Microphysical plasma processes are a proposed explanation of the observed high
rates, but it is an open question whether such processes can rapidly reconnect
astrophysical flux structures much greater in extent than several thousand ion
gyroradii. An alternative explanation is that turbulent Richardson advection
brings field lines implosively together from distances far apart to separations
of the order of gyroradii. Here we report an analysis of a simulation of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at high conductivity that exhibits Richardson
dispersion. This effect of advection in rough velocity fields, which appear
non-differentiable in space, leads to line motions that are completely
indeterministic or 'spontaneously stochastic', as predicted in analytical
studies. The turbulent breakdown of standard flux freezing at scales greater than
the ion gyroradius can explain fast reconnection of very large-scale flux
structures, both observed (solar flares and coronal mass ejections) and predicted
(the inner heliosheath, accretion disks, γ-ray bursts and so on). For laminar
plasma flows with smooth velocity fields or for low turbulence intensity,
stochastic flux freezing reduces to the usual frozen-in condition.

Shear-driven dynamo waves at high magnetic Reynolds number.

Astrophysical magnetic fields often display remarkable organization, despite
being generated by dynamo action driven by turbulent flows at high conductivity. 
An example is the eleven-year solar cycle, which shows spatial coherence over the
entire solar surface. The difficulty in understanding the emergence of this
large-scale organization is that whereas at low conductivity (measured by the
magnetic Reynolds number, Rm) dynamo fields are well organized, at high Rm their 
structure is dominated by rapidly varying small-scale fluctuations. This arises
because the smallest scales have the highest rate of strain, and can amplify
magnetic field most efficiently. Therefore most of the effort to find flows whose
large-scale dynamo properties persist at high Rm has been frustrated. Here we
report high-resolution simulations of a dynamo that can generate organized fields
at high Rm; indeed, the generation mechanism, which involves the interaction
between helical flows and shear, only becomes effective at large Rm. The shear
does not enhance generation at large scales, as is commonly thought; instead it
reduces generation at small scales. The solution consists of propagating dynamo
waves, whose existence was postulated more than 60 years ago and which have since
been used to model the solar cycle.

Longevity is regulated by a network of closely linked metabolic systems. We used 
a combination of mouse population genetics and RNA interference in Caenorhabditis
elegans to identify mitochondrial ribosomal protein S5 (Mrps5) and other
mitochondrial ribosomal proteins as metabolic and longevity regulators. MRP
knockdown triggers mitonuclear protein imbalance, reducing mitochondrial
respiration and activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Specific 
antibiotics targeting mitochondrial translation and ethidium bromide (which
impairs mitochondrial DNA transcription) pharmacologically mimic mrp knockdown
and extend worm lifespan by inducing mitonuclear protein imbalance, a
stoichiometric imbalance between nuclear and mitochondrially encoded proteins.
This mechanism was also conserved in mammalian cells. In addition, resveratrol
and rapamycin, longevity compounds acting on different molecular targets,
similarly induced mitonuclear protein imbalance, the mitochondrial unfolded
protein response and lifespan extension in C. elegans. Collectively these data
demonstrate that MRPs represent an evolutionarily conserved protein family that
ties the mitochondrial ribosome and mitonuclear protein imbalance to the
mitochondrial unfolded protein response, an overarching longevity pathway across 
many species.

Diacylglycerol kinase catalyses the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of
diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid for use in shuttling water-soluble components
to membrane-derived oligosaccharide and lipopolysaccharide in the cell envelope
of Gram-negative bacteria. For half a century, this 121-residue kinase has served
as a model for investigating membrane protein enzymology, folding, assembly and
stability. Here we present crystal structures for three functional forms of this 
unique and paradigmatic kinase, one of which is wild type. These reveal a
homo-trimeric enzyme with three transmembrane helices and an amino-terminal
amphiphilic helix per monomer. Bound lipid substrate and docked ATP identify the 
putative active site that is of the composite, shared site type. The crystal
structures rationalize extensive biochemical and biophysical data on the enzyme. 
They are, however, at variance with a published solution NMR model in that domain
swapping, a key feature of the solution form, is not observed in the crystal
structures.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase is the prototypical member of the Pif1
DNA helicase family, which is conserved from bacteria to humans. Here we show
that exceptionally potent G-quadruplex unwinding is conserved among Pif1
helicases. Moreover, Pif1 helicases from organisms separated by more than 3
billion years of evolution suppressed DNA damage at G-quadruplex motifs in yeast.
The G-quadruplex-induced damage generated in the absence of Pif1 helicases led to
new genetic and epigenetic changes. Furthermore, when expressed in yeast, human
PIF1 suppressed both G-quadruplex-associated DNA damage and telomere lengthening.

Most herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) reactivations in humans are subclinical and
associated with rapid expansion and containment of virus. Previous studies have
shown that CD8(+) T cells persist in genital skin and mucosa at the
dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ)--the portal of neuronal release of reactivating
virus--for prolonged time periods after herpes lesions are cleared. The phenotype
and function of this persistent CD8(+) T-cell population remain unknown. Here,
using cell-type-specific laser capture microdissection, transcriptional profiling
and T-cell antigen receptor β-chain (TCRβ) genotyping on sequential genital skin 
biopsies, we show that CD8αα(+) T cells are the dominant resident population of
DEJ CD8(+) T cells that persist at the site of previous HSV-2 reactivation.
CD8αα(+) T cells located at the DEJ lack chemokine-receptor expression required
for lymphocyte egress and recirculation, express gene signatures of T-cell
activation and antiviral activity, and produce cytolytic granules during clinical
and virological quiescent time periods. Sequencing of the TCR β-chain repertoire 
reveals that the DEJ CD8αα(+) T cells are oligoclonal with diverse usage of TCR
variable-β genes, which differ from those commonly described for
mucosa-associated invariant T cells and natural killer T cells. Dominant
clonotypes are shown to overlap among multiple recurrences over a period of
two-and-a-half years. Episodes of rapid asymptomatic HSV-2 containment were also 
associated with a high CD8 effector-to-target ratio and focal enrichment of
CD8αα(+) T cells. These studies indicate that DEJ CD8αα(+) T cells are
tissue-resident cells that seem to have a fundamental role in immune surveillance
and in initial containment of HSV-2 reactivation in human peripheral tissue.
Elicitation of CD8αα(+) T cells may be a critical component for developing
effective vaccines against skin and mucosal infections.

Laminopathies, caused by mutations in the LMNA gene encoding the nuclear envelope
proteins lamins A and C, represent a diverse group of diseases that include
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM),
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and Hutchison-Gilford progeria syndrome. Most
LMNA mutations affect skeletal and cardiac muscle by mechanisms that remain
incompletely understood. Loss of structural function and altered interaction of
mutant lamins with (tissue-specific) transcription factors have been proposed to 
explain the tissue-specific phenotypes. Here we report in mice that
lamin-A/C-deficient (Lmna(-/-)) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells have impaired 
nuclear translocation and downstream signalling of the mechanosensitive
transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukaemia 1 (MKL1), a myocardin family
member that is pivotal in cardiac development and function. Altered
nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of MKL1 was caused by altered actin dynamics in
Lmna(-/-) and Lmna(N195K/N195K) mutant cells. Ectopic expression of the nuclear
envelope protein emerin, which is mislocalized in Lmna mutant cells and also
linked to EDMD and DCM, restored MKL1 nuclear translocation and rescued actin
dynamics in mutant cells. These findings present a novel mechanism that could
provide insight into the disease aetiology for the cardiac phenotype in many
laminopathies, whereby lamin A/C and emerin regulate gene expression through
modulation of nuclear and cytoskeletal actin polymerization.

The proteasomal ATPase ring, comprising Rpt1-Rpt6, associates with the heptameric
α-ring of the proteasome core particle (CP) in the mature proteasome, with the
Rpt carboxy-terminal tails inserting into pockets of the α-ring. Rpt ring
assembly is mediated by four chaperones, each binding a distinct Rpt subunit.
Here we report that the base subassembly of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
proteasome, which includes the Rpt ring, forms a high-affinity complex with the
CP. This complex is subject to active dissociation by the chaperones Hsm3, Nas6
and Rpn14. Chaperone-mediated dissociation was abrogated by a non-hydrolysable
ATP analogue, indicating that chaperone action is coupled to nucleotide
hydrolysis by the Rpt ring. Unexpectedly, synthetic Rpt tail peptides bound
α-pockets with poor specificity, except for Rpt6, which uniquely bound the
α2/α3-pocket. Although the Rpt6 tail is not visualized within an α-pocket in
mature proteasomes, it inserts into the α2/α3-pocket in the base-CP complex and
is important for complex formation. Thus, the Rpt-CP interface is reconfigured
when the lid complex joins the nascent proteasome to form the mature holoenzyme.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is used as a parameter of osteoporosis.
Genome-wide association studies of BMD have hitherto focused on BMD as a
quantitative trait, yielding common variants of small effects that contribute to 
the population diversity in BMD. Here we use BMD as a dichotomous trait,
searching for variants that may have a direct effect on the risk of
pathologically low BMD rather than on the regulation of BMD in the healthy
population. Through whole-genome sequencing of Icelandic individuals, we found a 
rare nonsense mutation within the leucine-rich-repeat-containing
G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) gene (c.376C>T) that is strongly associated
with low BMD, and with osteoporotic fractures. This mutation leads to termination
of LGR4 at position 126 and fully disrupts its function. The c.376C>T mutation is
also associated with electrolyte imbalance, late onset of menarche and reduced
testosterone levels, as well as an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of
the skin and biliary tract cancer. Interestingly, the phenotype of carriers of
the c.376C>T mutation overlaps that of Lgr4 mutant mice.

Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a diffusible axonal chemorepellent that has an
important role in axon guidance. Previous studies have demonstrated that
Sema3a(-/-) mice have multiple developmental defects due to abnormal neuronal
innervations. Here we show in mice that Sema3A is abundantly expressed in bone,
and cell-based assays showed that Sema3A affected osteoblast differentiation in a
cell-autonomous fashion. Accordingly, Sema3a(-/-) mice had a low bone mass due to
decreased bone formation. However, osteoblast-specific Sema3A-deficient mice
(Sema3acol1(-/-) and Sema3aosx(-/-) mice) had normal bone mass, even though the
expression of Sema3A in bone was substantially decreased. In contrast, mice
lacking Sema3A in neurons (Sema3asynapsin(-/-) and Sema3anestin(-/-) mice) had
low bone mass, similar to Sema3a(-/-) mice, indicating that neuron-derived Sema3A
is responsible for the observed bone abnormalities independent of the local
effect of Sema3A in bone. Indeed, the number of sensory innervations of
trabecular bone was significantly decreased in Sema3asynapsin(-/-) mice, whereas 
sympathetic innervations of trabecular bone were unchanged. Moreover, ablating
sensory nerves decreased bone mass in wild-type mice, whereas it did not reduce
the low bone mass in Sema3anestin(-/-) mice further, supporting the essential
role of the sensory nervous system in normal bone homeostasis. Finally, neuronal 
abnormalities in Sema3a(-/-) mice, such as olfactory development, were identified
in Sema3asynasin(-/-) mice, demonstrating that neuron-derived Sema3A contributes 
to the abnormal neural development seen in Sema3a(-/-) mice, and indicating that 
Sema3A produced in neurons regulates neural development in an autocrine manner.
This study demonstrates that Sema3A regulates bone remodelling indirectly by
modulating sensory nerve development, but not directly by acting on osteoblasts.

The microRNA miR-235 couples blast-cell quiescence to the nutritional state.

The coordination of stem- and blast-cell behaviours, such as self-renewal,
differentiation and quiescence, with physiological changes underlies growth,
regeneration and tissue homeostasis. Germline stem and somatic blast cells in
newly hatched Caenorhabditis elegans larvae can suspend postembryonic
development, which consists of diverse cellular events such as migration,
proliferation and differentiation, until the nutritional state becomes favourable
(termed L1 diapause). Although previous studies showed that the
insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway regulates this 
developmental quiescence, the detailed mechanism by which the IIS pathway enables
these multipotent cells to respond to nutrient availability is unknown. Here we
show in C. elegans that the microRNA (miRNA) miR-235, a sole orthologue of
mammalian miR-92 from the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster, acts in the hypodermis and
glial cells to arrest postembryonic developmental events in both neuroblasts and 
mesoblasts. Expression of mir-235 persists during L1 diapause, and decreases upon
feeding in a manner dependent on the IIS pathway. Upregulation of one of the
miR-235 targets, nhr-91, which encodes an orthologue of mammalian germ cell
nuclear factor, is responsible for defects caused by loss of the miRNA. Our
findings establish a novel role of a miR-92 orthologue in coupling blast-cell
behaviours to the nutritional state.

The neural pathways by which information about the acoustic world reaches the
auditory cortex are well characterized, but how auditory representations are
transformed into motor commands is not known. Here we use a perceptual
decision-making task in rats to study this transformation. We demonstrate the
role of corticostriatal projection neurons in auditory decisions by manipulating 
the activity of these neurons in rats performing an auditory
frequency-discrimination task. Targeted channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated
stimulation of corticostriatal neurons during the task biased decisions in the
direction predicted by the frequency tuning of the stimulated neurons, whereas
archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)-mediated inactivation biased decisions in the opposite
direction. Striatal projections are widespread in cortex and may provide a
general mechanism for the control of motor decisions by sensory cortex.

There is a pressing need to develop alternatives to annual influenza vaccines and
antiviral agents licensed for mitigating influenza infection. Previous studies
reported that acute lung injury caused by chemical or microbial insults is
secondary to the generation of host-derived, oxidized phospholipid that potently 
stimulates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent inflammation. Subsequently, we
reported that Tlr4(-/-) mice are highly refractory to influenza-induced
lethality, and proposed that therapeutic antagonism of TLR4 signalling would
protect against influenza-induced acute lung injury. Here we report that
therapeutic administration of Eritoran (also known as E5564)-a potent,
well-tolerated, synthetic TLR4 antagonist-blocks influenza-induced lethality in
mice, as well as lung pathology, clinical symptoms, cytokine and oxidized
phospholipid expression, and decreases viral titres. CD14 and TLR2 are also
required for Eritoran-mediated protection, and CD14 directly binds Eritoran and
inhibits ligand binding to MD2. Thus, Eritoran blockade of TLR signalling
represents a novel therapeutic approach for inflammation associated with
influenza, and possibly other infections.

Many species are critically dependent on olfaction for survival. In the main
olfactory system of mammals, odours are detected by sensory neurons that express 
a large repertoire of canonical odorant receptors and a much smaller repertoire
of trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Odours are encoded in a
combinatorial fashion across glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb, with each
glomerulus corresponding to a specific receptor. The degree to which individual
receptor genes contribute to odour perception is unclear. Here we show that
genetic deletion of the olfactory Taar gene family, or even a single Taar gene
(Taar4), eliminates the aversion that mice display to low concentrations of
volatile amines and to the odour of predator urine. Our findings identify a role 
for the TAARs in olfaction, namely, in the high-sensitivity detection of innately
aversive odours. In addition, our data reveal that aversive amines are
represented in a non-redundant fashion, and that individual main olfactory
receptor genes can contribute substantially to odour perception.

An ambitious goal in biology is to understand the behaviour of cells during
development by imaging-in vivo and with subcellular resolution-changes of the
embryonic structure. Important morphogenetic movements occur throughout
embryogenesis, but in particular during gastrulation when a series of dramatic,
coordinated cell movements drives the reorganization of a simple ball or sheet of
cells into a complex multi-layered organism. In Xenopus laevis, the South African
clawed frog and also in zebrafish, cell and tissue movements have been studied in
explants, in fixed embryos, in vivo using fluorescence microscopy or microscopic 
magnetic resonance imaging. None of these methods allows cell behaviours to be
observed with micrometre-scale resolution throughout the optically opaque, living
embryo over developmental time. Here we use non-invasive in vivo, time-lapse
X-ray microtomography, based on single-distance phase contrast and combined with 
motion analysis, to examine the course of embryonic development. We demonstrate
that this powerful four-dimensional imaging technique provides high-resolution
views of gastrulation processes in wild-type X. laevis embryos, including vegetal
endoderm rotation, archenteron formation, changes in the volumes of cavities
within the porous interstitial tissue between archenteron and blastocoel,
migration/confrontation of mesendoderm and closure of the blastopore.
Differential flow analysis separates collective from relative cell motion to
assign propulsion mechanisms. Moreover, digitally determined volume balances
confirm that early archenteron inflation occurs through the uptake of external
water. A transient ectodermal ridge, formed in association with the confrontation
of ventral and head mesendoderm on the blastocoel roof, is identified. When
combined with perturbation experiments to investigate molecular and biomechanical
underpinnings of morphogenesis, our technique should help to advance our
understanding of the fundamentals of development.

Marine fishes and invertebrates respond to ocean warming through distribution
shifts, generally to higher latitudes and deeper waters. Consequently, fisheries 
should be affected by 'tropicalization' of catch (increasing dominance of
warm-water species). However, a signature of such climate-change effects on
global fisheries catch has so far not been detected. Here we report such an
index, the mean temperature of the catch (MTC), that is calculated from the
average inferred temperature preference of exploited species weighted by their
annual catch. Our results show that, after accounting for the effects of fishing 
and large-scale oceanographic variability, global MTC increased at a rate of 0.19
degrees Celsius per decade between 1970 and 2006, and non-tropical MTC increased 
at a rate of 0.23 degrees Celsius per decade. In tropical areas, MTC increased
initially because of the reduction in the proportion of subtropical species
catches, but subsequently stabilized as scope for further tropicalization of
communities became limited. Changes in MTC in 52 large marine ecosystems,
covering the majority of the world's coastal and shelf areas, are significantly
and positively related to regional changes in sea surface temperature. This study
shows that ocean warming has already affected global fisheries in the past four
decades, highlighting the immediate need to develop adaptation plans to minimize 
the effect of such warming on the economy and food security of coastal
communities, particularly in tropical regions.

Fluids trapped as inclusions within minerals can be billions of years old and
preserve a record of the fluid chemistry and environment at the time of
mineralization. Aqueous fluids that have had a similar residence time at mineral 
interfaces and in fractures (fracture fluids) have not been previously
identified. Expulsion of fracture fluids from basement systems with low
connectivity occurs through deformation and fracturing of the brittle crust. The 
fractal nature of this process must, at some scale, preserve pockets of
interconnected fluid from the earliest crustal history. In one such system, 2.8
kilometres below the surface in a South African gold mine, extant
chemoautotrophic microbes have been identified in fluids isolated from the
photosphere on timescales of tens of millions of years. Deep fracture fluids with
similar chemistry have been found in a mine in the Timmins, Ontario, area of the 
Canadian Precambrian Shield. Here we show that excesses of (124)Xe, (126)Xe and
(128)Xe in the Timmins mine fluids can be linked to xenon isotope changes in the 
ancient atmosphere and used to calculate a minimum mean residence time for this
fluid of about 1.5 billion years. Further evidence of an ancient fluid system is 
found in (129)Xe excesses that, owing to the absence of any identifiable mantle
input, are probably sourced in sediments and extracted by fluid migration
processes operating during or shortly after mineralization at around 2.64 billion
years ago. We also provide closed-system radiogenic noble-gas ((4)He, (21)Ne,
(40)Ar, (136)Xe) residence times. Together, the different noble gases show that
ancient pockets of water can survive the crustal fracturing process and remain in
the crust for billions of years.

Conventional semiconductor laser emission relies on stimulated emission of
photons, which sets stringent requirements on the minimum amount of energy
necessary for its operation. In comparison, exciton-polaritons in strongly
coupled quantum well microcavities can undergo stimulated scattering that
promises more energy-efficient generation of coherent light by 'polariton
lasers'. Polariton laser operation has been demonstrated in optically pumped
semiconductor microcavities at temperatures up to room temperature, and such
lasers can outperform their weak-coupling counterparts in that they have a lower 
threshold density. Even though polariton diodes have been realized, electrically 
pumped polariton laser operation, which is essential for practical applications, 
has not been achieved until now. Here we present an electrically pumped polariton
laser based on a microcavity containing multiple quantum wells. To prove
polariton laser emission unambiguously, we apply a magnetic field and probe the
hybrid light-matter nature of the polaritons. Our results represent an important 
step towards the practical implementation of polaritonic light sources and
electrically injected condensates, and can be extended to room-temperature
operation using wide-bandgap materials.

The observed cloud-level atmospheric circulation on the outer planets of the
Solar System is dominated by strong east-west jet streams. The depth of these
winds is a crucial unknown in constraining their overall dynamics, energetics and
internal structures. There are two approaches to explaining the existence of
these strong winds. The first suggests that the jets are driven by shallow
atmospheric processes near the surface, whereas the second suggests that the
atmospheric dynamics extend deeply into the planetary interiors. Here we report
that on Uranus and Neptune the depth of the atmospheric dynamics can be revealed 
by the planets' respective gravity fields. We show that the measured fourth-order
gravity harmonic, J4, constrains the dynamics to the outermost 0.15 per cent of
the total mass of Uranus and the outermost 0.2 per cent of the total mass of
Neptune. This provides a stronger limit to the depth of the dynamical atmosphere 
than previously suggested, and shows that the dynamics are confined to a thin
weather layer no more than about 1,000 kilometres deep on both planets.

Bacterial biofilms are surface-associated, multicellular, morphologically complex
microbial communities. Biofilm-forming bacteria such as the opportunistic
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are phenotypically distinct from their
free-swimming, planktonic counterparts. Much work has focused on factors
affecting surface adhesion, and it is known that P. aeruginosa secretes the Psl
exopolysaccharide, which promotes surface attachment by acting as 'molecular
glue'. However, how individual surface-attached bacteria self-organize into
microcolonies, the first step in communal biofilm organization, is not well
understood. Here we identify a new role for Psl in early biofilm development
using a massively parallel cell-tracking algorithm to extract the motility
history of every cell on a newly colonized surface. By combining this technique
with fluorescent Psl staining and computer simulations, we show that P.
aeruginosa deposits a trail of Psl as it moves on a surface, which influences the
surface motility of subsequent cells that encounter these trails and thus
generates positive feedback. Both experiments and simulations indicate that the
web of secreted Psl controls the distribution of surface visit frequencies, which
can be approximated by a power law. This Pareto-type behaviour indicates that the
bacterial community self-organizes in a manner analogous to a capitalist economic
system, a 'rich-get-richer' mechanism of Psl accumulation that results in a small
number of 'elite' cells becoming extremely enriched in communally produced Psl.
Using engineered strains with inducible Psl production, we show that local Psl
concentrations determine post-division cell fates and that high local Psl
concentrations ultimately allow elite cells to serve as the founding population
for initial microcolony development.

Inferring ancient divergences requires genes with strong phylogenetic signals.

To tackle incongruence, the topological conflict between different gene trees,
phylogenomic studies couple concatenation with practices such as rogue taxon
removal or the use of slowly evolving genes. Phylogenomic analysis of 1,070
orthologues from 23 yeast genomes identified 1,070 distinct gene trees, which
were all incongruent with the phylogeny inferred from concatenation. Incongruence
severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny.
Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast
phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support
significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results
in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results
question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and
argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the
absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing
ancient divergences.

Molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is an electrometallurgical technique that enables
the direct production of metal in the liquid state from oxide feedstock, and
compared with traditional methods of extractive metallurgy offers both a
substantial simplification of the process and a significant reduction in energy
consumption. MOE is also considered a promising route for mitigation of CO2
emissions in steelmaking, production of metals free of carbon, and generation of 
oxygen for extra-terrestrial exploration. Until now, MOE has been demonstrated
using anode materials that are consumable (graphite for use with ferro-alloys and
titanium) or unaffordable for terrestrial applications (iridium for use with
iron). To enable metal production without process carbon, MOE requires an anode
material that resists depletion while sustaining oxygen evolution. The challenges
for iron production are threefold. First, the process temperature is in excess of
1,538 degrees Celsius (ref. 10). Second, under anodic polarization most metals
inevitably corrode in such conditions. Third, iron oxide undergoes spontaneous
reduction on contact with most refractory metals and even carbon. Here we show
that anodes comprising chromium-based alloys exhibit limited consumption during
iron extraction and oxygen evolution by MOE. The anode stability is due to the
formation of an electronically conductive solid solution of chromium(iii) and
aluminium oxides in the corundum structure. These findings make practicable
larger-scale evaluation of MOE for the production of steel, and potentially
provide a key material component enabling mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions 
while producing metal of superior metallurgical quality.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show differential expression across breast cancer subtypes,
and have both oncogenic and tumour-suppressive roles. Here we report the miRNA
expression profiles of 1,302 breast tumours with matching detailed clinical
annotation, long-term follow-up and genomic and messenger RNA expression data.
This provides a comprehensive overview of the quantity, distribution and
variation of the miRNA population and provides information on the extent to which
genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA
expression architecture, suggesting an important role for post-transcriptional
regulation. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the
miRNA landscape are characterized, revealing context-dependent interactions, for 
example with regards to cell adhesion and Wnt signalling. Notably, only
prognostic miRNA signatures derived from breast tumours devoid of somatic
copy-number aberrations (CNA-devoid) are consistently prognostic across several
other subtypes and can be validated in external cohorts. We then use a
data-driven approach to seek the effects of miRNAs associated with differential
co-expression of mRNAs, and find that miRNAs act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA
interactions rather than as on-off molecular switches. We demonstrate such an
important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of CNA-devoid breast cancers,
a common subtype in which the immune response is prominent. These findings
represent a new framework for studying the biology of miRNAs in human breast
cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are generated by two-step processing to yield small RNAs that 
negatively regulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
Deregulation of miRNAs has been linked to diverse pathological processes,
including cancer. Recent studies have also implicated miRNAs in the regulation of
cellular response to a spectrum of stresses, such as hypoxia, which is frequently
encountered in the poorly angiogenic core of a solid tumour. However, the
upstream regulators of miRNA biogenesis machineries remain obscure, raising the
question of how tumour cells efficiently coordinate and impose specificity on
miRNA expression and function in response to stresses. Here we show that
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is the product of a
well-characterized oncogene in human cancers, suppresses the maturation of
specific tumour-suppressor-like miRNAs in response to hypoxic stress through
phosphorylation of argonaute 2 (AGO2) at Tyr 393. The association between EGFR
and AGO2 is enhanced by hypoxia, leading to elevated AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation,
which in turn reduces the binding of Dicer to AGO2 and inhibits miRNA processing 
from precursor miRNAs to mature miRNAs. We also identify a long-loop structure in
precursor miRNAs as a critical regulatory element in phospho-Y393-AGO2-mediated
miRNA maturation. Furthermore, AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation mediates EGFR-enhanced
cell survival and invasiveness under hypoxia, and correlates with poorer overall 
survival in breast cancer patients. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized
function of EGFR in miRNA maturation and demonstrates how EGFR is likely to
function as a regulator of AGO2 through novel post-translational modification.
These findings suggest that modulation of miRNA biogenesis is important for
stress response in tumour cells and has potential clinical implications.

It is not known whether natural selection can encounter any given phenotype that 
can be produced by genetic variation. There has been a long-lasting debate about 
the processes that limit adaptation and, consequently, about how well adapted
phenotypes are. Here we examine how development may affect adaptation, by
decomposing the genotype-fitness map-the association between each genotype and
its fitness-into two: one mapping genotype to phenotype by means of a
computational model of organ development, and one mapping phenotype to fitness.
In the map of phenotype and fitness, the fitness of each individual is based on
the similarity between realized morphology and optimal morphology. We use three
different simulations to map phenotype to fitness, and these differ in the way in
which similarity is calculated: similarity is calculated for each trait (in terms
of each cell position individually), for a large or a small number of phenotypic 
landmarks (the 'many-traits' and 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps), and by
measuring the overall surface roughness of morphology (the 'roughness'
phenotype-fitness map). Evolution is simulated by applying the genotype-phenotype
map and one phenotype-fitness map to each individual in the population, as well
as random mutation and drift. We show that the complexity of the
genotype-phenotype map prevents substantial adaptation in some of the
phenotype-fitness maps: sustained adaptation is only possible using 'roughness'
or 'few-traits' phenotype-fitness maps. The results contribute developmental
understanding to the long-standing question of which aspects of phenotype can be 
effectively optimized by natural selection.

The smoothened (SMO) receptor, a key signal transducer in the hedgehog signalling
pathway, is responsible for the maintenance of normal embryonic development and
is implicated in carcinogenesis. It is classified as a class frizzled (class F)
G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), although the canonical hedgehog signalling
pathway involves the GLI transcription factors and the sequence similarity with
class A GPCRs is less than 10%. Here we report the crystal structure of the
transmembrane domain of the human SMO receptor bound to the small-molecule
antagonist LY2940680 at 2.5 Å resolution. Although the SMO receptor shares the
seven-transmembrane helical fold, most of the conserved motifs for class A GPCRs 
are absent, and the structure reveals an unusually complex arrangement of long
extracellular loops stabilized by four disulphide bonds. The ligand binds at the 
extracellular end of the seven-transmembrane-helix bundle and forms extensive
contacts with the loops.

Cell-surface-receptor binding by influenza viruses is a key determinant of their 
transmissibility, both from avian and animal species to humans as well as from
human to human. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses that are a threat to public 
health have been observed to acquire affinity for human receptors, and
transmissible-mutant-selection experiments have identified a virus that is
transmissible in ferrets, the generally accepted experimental model for influenza
in humans. Here, our quantitative biophysical measurements of the
receptor-binding properties of haemagglutinin (HA) from the transmissible mutant 
indicate a small increase in affinity for human receptor and a marked decrease in
affinity for avian receptor. From analysis of virus and HA binding data we have
derived an algorithm that predicts virus avidity from the affinity of individual 
HA-receptor interactions. It reveals that the transmissible-mutant virus has a
200-fold preference for binding human over avian receptors. The crystal structure
of the transmissible-mutant HA in complex with receptor analogues shows that it
has acquired the ability to bind human receptor in the same folded-back
conformation as seen for HA from the 1918, 1957 (ref. 4), 1968 (ref. 5) and 2009 
(ref. 6) pandemic viruses. This binding mode is substantially different from that
by which non-transmissible wild-type H5 virus HA binds human receptor. The
structure of the complex also explains how the change in preference from avian to
human receptors arises from the Gln226Leu substitution, which facilitates binding
to human receptor but restricts binding to avian receptor. Both features probably
contribute to the acquisition of transmissibility by this mutant virus.

Postnatal/adult neural stem cells (NSCs) within the rodent subventricular zone
(SVZ; also called subependymal zone) generate doublecortin (Dcx)(+) neuroblasts
that migrate and integrate into olfactory bulb circuitry. Continuous production
of neuroblasts is controlled by the SVZ microenvironmental niche. It is generally
thought that enhancing the neurogenic activities of endogenous NSCs may provide
needed therapeutic options for disease states and after brain injury. However,
SVZ NSCs can also differentiate into astrocytes. It remains unclear whether there
are conditions that favour astrogenesis over neurogenesis in the SVZ niche, and
whether astrocytes produced there have different properties compared with
astrocytes produced elsewhere in the brain. Here we show in mice that
SVZ-generated astrocytes express high levels of thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4), a
secreted homopentameric glycoprotein, in contrast to cortical astrocytes, which
express low levels of Thbs4. We found that localized photothrombotic/ischaemic
cortical injury initiates a marked increase in Thbs4(hi) astrocyte production
from the postnatal SVZ niche. Tamoxifen-inducible nestin-creER(tm)4 lineage
tracing demonstrated that it is these SVZ-generated Thbs4(hi) astrocytes, and not
Dcx(+) neuroblasts, that home-in on the injured cortex. This robust post-injury
astrogenic response required SVZ Notch activation modulated by Thbs4 via direct
Notch1 receptor binding and endocytosis to activate downstream signals, including
increased Nfia transcription factor expression important for glia production.
Consequently, Thbs4 homozygous knockout mice (Thbs4(KO/KO)) showed severe defects
in cortical-injury-induced SVZ astrogenesis, instead producing cells expressing
Dcx migrating from SVZ to the injury sites. These alterations in cellular
responses resulted in abnormal glial scar formation after injury, and
significantly increased microvascular haemorrhage into the brain parenchyma of
Thbs4(KO/KO) mice. Taken together, these findings have important implications for
post-injury applications of endogenous and transplanted NSCs in the therapeutic
setting, as well as disease states where Thbs family members have important
roles.

Obtaining high-resolution information from a complex system, while maintaining
the global perspective needed to understand system function, represents a key
challenge in biology. Here we address this challenge with a method (termed
CLARITY) for the transformation of intact tissue into a nanoporous
hydrogel-hybridized form (crosslinked to a three-dimensional network of
hydrophilic polymers) that is fully assembled but optically transparent and
macromolecule-permeable. Using mouse brains, we show intact-tissue imaging of
long-range projections, local circuit wiring, cellular relationships, subcellular
structures, protein complexes, nucleic acids and neurotransmitters. CLARITY also 
enables intact-tissue in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry with multiple
rounds of staining and de-staining in non-sectioned tissue, and antibody
labelling throughout the intact adult mouse brain. Finally, we show that CLARITY 
enables fine structural analysis of clinical samples, including non-sectioned
human tissue from a neuropsychiatric-disease setting, establishing a path for the
transmutation of human tissue into a stable, intact and accessible form suitable 
for probing structural and molecular underpinnings of physiological function and 
disease.

Over the past decade, ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet increased as a result
of both increased surface melting and ice discharge to the ocean. The latter is
controlled by the acceleration of ice flow and subsequent thinning of
fast-flowing marine-terminating outlet glaciers. Quantifying the future dynamic
contribution of such glaciers to sea-level rise (SLR) remains a major challenge
because outlet glacier dynamics are poorly understood. Here we present a glacier 
flow model that includes a fully dynamic treatment of marine termini. We use this
model to simulate behaviour of four major marine-terminating outlet glaciers,
which collectively drain about 22 per cent of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using
atmospheric and oceanic forcing from a mid-range future warming scenario that
predicts warming by 2.8 degrees Celsius by 2100, we project a contribution of 19 
to 30 millimetres to SLR from these glaciers by 2200. This contribution is
largely (80 per cent) dynamic in origin and is caused by several episodic
retreats past overdeepenings in outlet glacier troughs. After initial increases, 
however, dynamic losses from these four outlets remain relatively constant and
contribute to SLR individually at rates of about 0.01 to 0.06 millimetres per
year. These rates correspond to ice fluxes that are less than twice those of the 
late 1990s, well below previous upper bounds. For a more extreme future warming
scenario (warming by 4.5 degrees Celsius by 2100), the projected losses increase 
by more than 50 per cent, producing a cumulative SLR of 29 to 49 millimetres by
2200.

Spiral galaxies must acquire gas to maintain their observed level of star
formation beyond the next few billion years. A source of this material may be the
gas that resides between galaxies, but our understanding of the state and
distribution of this gas is incomplete. Radio observations of the Local Group of 
galaxies have revealed hydrogen gas extending from the disk of the galaxy M31 at 
least halfway to M33. This feature has been interpreted to be the neutral
component of a condensing intergalactic filament, which would be able to fuel
star formation in M31 and M33, but simulations suggest that such a feature could 
also result from an interaction between both galaxies within the past few billion
years (ref. 5). Here we report radio observations showing that about 50 per cent 
of this gas is composed of clouds, with the rest distributed in an extended,
diffuse component. The clouds have velocities comparable to those of M31 and M33,
and have properties suggesting that they are unrelated to other Local Group
objects. We conclude that the clouds are likely to be transient condensations of 
gas embedded in an intergalactic filament and are therefore a potential source of
fuel for future star formation in M31 and M33.

There is strong circumstantial evidence that certain heavy, unstable atomic
nuclei are 'octupole deformed', that is, distorted into a pear shape. This
contrasts with the more prevalent rugby-ball shape of nuclei with
reflection-symmetric, quadrupole deformations. The elusive octupole deformed
nuclei are of importance for nuclear structure theory, and also in searches for
physics beyond the standard model; any measurable electric-dipole moment (a
signature of the latter) is expected to be amplified in such nuclei. Here we
determine electric octupole transition strengths (a direct measure of octupole
correlations) for short-lived isotopes of radon and radium. Coulomb excitation
experiments were performed using accelerated beams of heavy, radioactive ions.
Our data on (220)Rn and (224)Ra show clear evidence for stronger octupole
deformation in the latter. The results enable discrimination between differing
theoretical approaches to octupole correlations, and help to constrain suitable
candidates for experimental studies of atomic electric-dipole moments that might 
reveal extensions to the standard model.

Ageing is a result of gradual and overall functional deteriorations across the
body; however, it is unknown whether an individual tissue primarily works to
mediate the ageing progress and control lifespan. Here we show that the
hypothalamus is important for the development of whole-body ageing in mice, and
that the underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated by IκB kinase-β
(IKK-β), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and related microglia-neuron immune crosstalk.
Several interventional models were developed showing that ageing retardation and 
lifespan extension are achieved in mice by preventing ageing-related hypothalamic
or brain IKK-β and NF-κB activation. Mechanistic studies further revealed that
IKK-β and NF-κB inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to mediate
ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline, and GnRH treatment amends
ageing-impaired neurogenesis and decelerates ageing. In conclusion, the
hypothalamus has a programmatic role in ageing development via
immune-neuroendocrine integration, and immune inhibition or GnRH restoration in
the hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies for optimizing lifespan
and combating ageing-related health problems.

Fermi liquid theory provides a remarkably powerful framework for the description 
of the conduction electrons in metals and their ordering phenomena, such as
superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin- and charge-density-wave order. A
different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin
configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be
destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero. Examples of 
such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either pointing 
inwards or outwards) and vortices. A central question concerns the nature of the 
metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct spin textures. Here
we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at the border of the
skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of magnetic order composed 
of topologically non-trivial vortices. When long-range magnetic order is
suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the skyrmion lattice--that
is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent magnetic flux associated with
the topological winding--is unaffected in sign or magnitude and becomes an
important characteristic of the metallic state. The regime of the topological
Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic field coincides thereby with
the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid resistivity.
The observation of this topological Hall signal in the regime of the NFL
resistivity suggests empirically that spin correlations with non-trivial
topological character may drive a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure
metals.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related
protein kinase, controls cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors 
and is frequently deregulated in cancer. Here we report co-crystal structures of 
a complex of truncated mTOR and mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8)
with an ATP transition state mimic and with ATP-site inhibitors. The structures
reveal an intrinsically active kinase conformation, with catalytic residues and a
catalytic mechanism remarkably similar to canonical protein kinases. The active
site is highly recessed owing to the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain and an
inhibitory helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR-activating mutations
map to the structural framework that holds these elements in place, indicating
that the kinase is controlled by restricted access. In vitro biochemistry shows
that the FRB domain acts as a gatekeeper, with its rapamycin-binding site
interacting with substrates to grant them access to the restricted active site.
Rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits the kinase by directly blocking substrate recruitment
and by further restricting active-site access. The structures also reveal
active-site residues and conformational changes that underlie inhibitor potency
and specificity.

Peripheral mechanisms preventing autoimmunity and maintaining tolerance to
commensal microbiota involve CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells generated 
in the thymus or extrathymically by induction of naive CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T cells.
Previous studies suggested that the T-cell receptor repertoires of thymic Treg
cells and induced Treg cells are biased towards self and non-self antigens,
respectively, but their relative contribution in controlling immunopathology,
such as colitis and other untoward inflammatory responses triggered by different 
types of antigens, remains unresolved. The intestine, and especially the colon,
is a particularly suitable organ to study this question, given the variety of
self-, microbiota- and food-derived antigens to which Treg cells and other T-cell
populations are exposed. Intestinal environments can enhance conversion to a
regulatory lineage and favour tolerogenic presentation of antigens to naive
CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that intestinal homeostasis depends on
microbiota-specific induced Treg cells. Here, to identify the origin and
antigen-specificity of intestinal Treg cells, we performed single-cell and
high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor repertoires of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) 
and CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T cells, and analysed their reactivity against specific
commensal species. We show that thymus-derived Treg cells constitute most Treg
cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, where their
repertoire is heavily influenced by the composition of the microbiota. Our
results suggest that thymic Treg cells, and not induced Treg cells, dominantly
mediate tolerance to antigens produced by intestinal commensals.

Whisking and sniffing are predominant aspects of exploratory behaviour in
rodents. Yet the neural mechanisms that generate and coordinate these and other
orofacial motor patterns remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use anatomical, 
behavioural, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools to show that whisking
and sniffing are coordinated by respiratory centres in the ventral medulla. We
delineate a distinct region in the ventral medulla that provides rhythmic input
to the facial motor neurons that drive protraction of the vibrissae. Neuronal
output from this region is reset at each inspiration by direct input from the
pre-Bötzinger complex, such that high-frequency sniffing has a one-to-one
relationship with whisking, whereas basal respiration is accompanied by
intervening whisks that occur between breaths. We conjecture that the respiratory
nuclei, which project to other premotor regions for oral and facial control,
function as a master clock for behaviours that coordinate with breathing.

Skeletal muscle arises from the fusion of precursor myoblasts into multinucleated
myofibres. Although conserved transcription factors and signalling proteins
involved in myogenesis have been identified, upstream regulators are less well
understood. Here we report an unexpected discovery that the membrane protein
BAI1, previously linked to recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, promotes
myoblast fusion. Endogenous BAI1 expression increased during myoblast fusion, and
BAI1 overexpression enhanced myoblast fusion by means of signalling through
ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 proteins. During myoblast fusion, a fraction of myoblasts
within the population underwent apoptosis and exposed phosphatidylserine, an
established ligand for BAI1 (ref. 3). Blocking apoptosis potently impaired
myoblast fusion, and adding back apoptotic myoblasts restored fusion.
Furthermore, primary human myoblasts could be induced to form myotubes by adding 
apoptotic myoblasts, even under normal growth conditions. Mechanistically,
apoptotic cells did not directly fuse with the healthy myoblasts, rather the
apoptotic cells induced a contact-dependent signalling with neighbours to promote
fusion among the healthy myoblasts. In vivo, myofibres from Bai1(-/-) mice are
smaller than those from wild-type littermates. Muscle regeneration after injury
was also impaired in Bai1(-/-)mice, highlighting a role for BAI1 in mammalian
myogenesis. Collectively, these data identify apoptotic cells as a new type of
cue that induces signalling via the phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1 to promote
fusion of healthy myoblasts, with important implications for muscle development
and repair.

A role for the Perlman syndrome exonuclease Dis3l2 in the Lin28-let-7 pathway.

    Nat Rev Cancer. 2013 Jun;13(6):377.

The pluripotency factor Lin28 blocks the expression of let-7 microRNAs in
undifferentiated cells during development, and functions as an oncogene in a
subset of cancers. Lin28 binds to let-7 precursor (pre-let-7) RNAs and recruits
3' terminal uridylyl transferases to selectively inhibit let-7 biogenesis.
Uridylated pre-let-7 is refractory to processing by Dicer, and is rapidly
degraded by an unknown RNase. Here we identify Dis3l2 as the 3'-5' exonuclease
responsible for the decay of uridylated pre-let-7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. 
Biochemical reconstitution assays show that 3' oligouridylation stimulates Dis3l2
activity in vitro, and knockdown of Dis3l2 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to
the stabilization of pre-let-7. Our study establishes 3' oligouridylation as an
RNA decay signal for Dis3l2, and identifies the first physiological RNA substrate
of this new exonuclease, which is mutated in the Perlman syndrome of fetal
overgrowth and causes a predisposition to Wilms' tumour development.

The neonatal mammalian heart is capable of substantial regeneration following
injury through cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, this regenerative capacity
is lost by postnatal day 7 and the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest 
remain unclear. The homeodomain transcription factor Meis1 is required for normal
cardiac development but its role in cardiomyocytes is unknown. Here we identify
Meis1 as a critical regulator of the cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Meis1 deletion in 
mouse cardiomyocytes was sufficient for extension of the postnatal proliferative 
window of cardiomyocytes, and for re-activation of cardiomyocyte mitosis in the
adult heart with no deleterious effect on cardiac function. In contrast,
overexpression of Meis1 in cardiomyocytes decreased neonatal myocyte
proliferation and inhibited neonatal heart regeneration. Finally, we show that
Meis1 is required for transcriptional activation of the synergistic CDK
inhibitors p15, p16 and p21. These results identify Meis1 as a critical
transcriptional regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and a potential
therapeutic target for heart regeneration.

The violation of a Bell inequality is an experimental observation that forces the
abandonment of a local realistic viewpoint--namely, one in which physical
properties are (probabilistically) defined before and independently of
measurement, and in which no physical influence can propagate faster than the
speed of light. All such experimental violations require additional assumptions
depending on their specific construction, making them vulnerable to so-called
loopholes. Here we use entangled photons to violate a Bell inequality while
closing the fair-sampling loophole, that is, without assuming that the sample of 
measured photons accurately represents the entire ensemble. To do this, we use
the Eberhard form of Bell's inequality, which is not vulnerable to the
fair-sampling assumption and which allows a lower collection efficiency than
other forms. Technical improvements of the photon source and high-efficiency
transition-edge sensors were crucial for achieving a sufficiently high collection
efficiency. Our experiment makes the photon the first physical system for which
each of the main loopholes has been closed, albeit in different experiments.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, composed of importers and exporters,
form one of the biggest protein superfamilies that transport a variety of
substrates across the membrane, powered by ATP hydrolysis. Most ABC transporters 
are composed of two transmembrane domains and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding 
domains. Also, importers from prokaryotes usually have extra solute-binding
proteins in the periplasm that are responsible for the binding of substrates.
Structures of importers have been reported that suggested a two-state model for
the transport mechanism. Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters belong to a
new class of ATP-binding cassette importers. Each ECF transporter comprises an
energy-coupling module consisting of a transmembrane T protein (EcfT), two
nucleotide-binding proteins (EcfA and EcfA'), and another transmembrane
substrate-specific binding S protein (EcfS). Despite the similarities with ABC
transporters, ECF transporters have different organizational and functional
properties. The lack of solute-binding proteins in ECF transporters
differentiates them clearly from the canonical ABC importers. Previously reported
structures of the EcfS proteins RibU and ThiT clearly demonstrated the binding
site of substrate riboflavin and thiamine, respectively. However, the
organization of the four different components and the transport mechanism of ECF 
transporters remain unknown. Here we present the structure of an intact folate
ECF transporter from Lactobacillus brevis at a resolution of 3 Å. This structure 
was captured in an inward-facing, nucleotide-free conformation with no bound
substrate. The folate-binding protein FolT is nearly parallel to the membrane and
is bound almost entirely by EcfT, which adopts an L shape and connects to EcfA
and EcfA' through two coupling helices. Two conserved XRX motifs from the
coupling helices of EcfT have a vital role in energy coupling by docking into
EcfA-EcfA'. We propose a transport model that involves a substantial
conformational change of FolT.

CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic
repeats/CRISPR-associated) systems are a bacterial defence against invading
foreign nucleic acids derived from bacteriophages or exogenous plasmids. These
systems use an array of small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) consisting of repetitive
sequences flanking unique spacers to recognize their targets, and conserved Cas
proteins to mediate target degradation. Recent studies have suggested that these 
systems may have broader functions in bacterial physiology, and it is unknown if 
they regulate expression of endogenous genes. Here we demonstrate that the Cas
protein Cas9 of Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated 
RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial
lipoprotein. As bacterial lipoproteins trigger a proinflammatory innate immune
response aimed at combating pathogens, CRISPR/Cas-mediated repression of
bacterial lipoprotein expression is critical for F. novicida to dampen this host 
response and promote virulence. Because Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in
pathogenic and commensal bacteria, our work indicates that CRISPR/Cas-mediated
gene regulation may broadly contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial 
genes, particularly during the interaction of such bacteria with eukaryotic
hosts.

The energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters constitute a novel family of
conserved membrane transporters in prokaryotes that have a similar domain
organization to the ATP-binding cassette transporters. Each ECF transporter
comprises a pair of cytosolic ATPases (the A and A' components, or EcfA and
EcfA'), a membrane-embedded substrate-binding protein (the S component, or EcfS) 
and a transmembrane energy-coupling component (the T component, or EcfT) that
links the EcfA-EcfA' subcomplex to EcfS. The structure and transport mechanism of
the quaternary ECF transporter remain largely unknown. Here we report the crystal
structure of a nucleotide-free ECF transporter from Lactobacillus brevis at a
resolution of 3.5 Å. The T component has a horseshoe-shaped open architecture,
with five α-helices as transmembrane segments and two cytoplasmic α-helices as
coupling modules connecting to the A and A' components. Strikingly, the S
component, thought to be specific for hydroxymethyl pyrimidine, lies horizontally
along the lipid membrane and is bound exclusively by the five transmembrane
segments and the two cytoplasmic helices of the T component. These structural
features suggest a plausible working model for the transport cycle of the ECF
transporters.

Under stress conditions such as infection or inflammation the body rapidly needs 
to generate new blood cells that are adapted to the challenge. Haematopoietic
cytokines are known to increase output of specific mature cells by affecting
survival, expansion and differentiation of lineage-committed progenitors, but it 
has been debated whether long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are
susceptible to direct lineage-specifying effects of cytokines. Although genetic
changes in transcription factor balance can sensitize HSCs to cytokine
instruction, the initiation of HSC commitment is generally thought to be
triggered by stochastic fluctuation in cell-intrinsic regulators such as
lineage-specific transcription factors, leaving cytokines to ensure survival and 
proliferation of the progeny cells. Here we show that macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, also called CSF1), a myeloid cytokine released 
during infection and inflammation, can directly induce the myeloid master
regulator PU.1 and instruct myeloid cell-fate change in mouse HSCs, independently
of selective survival or proliferation. Video imaging and single-cell gene
expression analysis revealed that stimulation of highly purified HSCs with M-CSF 
in culture resulted in activation of the PU.1 promoter and an increased number of
PU.1(+) cells with myeloid gene signature and differentiation potential. In vivo,
high systemic levels of M-CSF directly stimulated M-CSF-receptor-dependent
activation of endogenous PU.1 protein in single HSCs and induced a PU.1-dependent
myeloid differentiation preference. Our data demonstrate that lineage-specific
cytokines can act directly on HSCs in vitro and in vivo to instruct a change of
cell identity. This fundamentally changes the current view of how HSCs respond to
environmental challenge and implicates stress-induced cytokines as direct
instructors of HSC fate.

In arthropods, evolution has created a remarkably sophisticated class of imaging 
systems, with a wide-angle field of view, low aberrations, high acuity to motion 
and an infinite depth of field. A challenge in building digital cameras with the 
hemispherical, compound apposition layouts of arthropod eyes is that essential
design requirements cannot be met with existing planar sensor technologies or
conventional optics. Here we present materials, mechanics and integration schemes
that afford scalable pathways to working, arthropod-inspired cameras with nearly 
full hemispherical shapes (about 160 degrees). Their surfaces are densely
populated by imaging elements (artificial ommatidia), which are comparable in
number (180) to those of the eyes of fire ants (Solenopsis fugax) and bark
beetles (Hylastes nigrinus). The devices combine elastomeric compound optical
elements with deformable arrays of thin silicon photodetectors into integrated
sheets that can be elastically transformed from the planar geometries in which
they are fabricated to hemispherical shapes for integration into apposition
cameras. Our imaging results and quantitative ray-tracing-based simulations
illustrate key features of operation. These general strategies seem to be
applicable to other compound eye devices, such as those inspired by moths and
lacewings (refracting superposition eyes), lobster and shrimp (reflecting
superposition eyes), and houseflies (neural superposition eyes).

The detection of electron spins associated with single defects in solids is a
critical operation for a range of quantum information and measurement
applications under development. So far, it has been accomplished for only two
defect centres in crystalline solids: phosphorus dopants in silicon, for which
electrical read-out based on a single-electron transistor is used, and
nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, for which optical read-out is used. A spin
read-out fidelity of about 90 per cent has been demonstrated with both electrical
read-out and optical read-out; however, the thermal limitations of the former and
the poor photon collection efficiency of the latter make it difficult to achieve 
the higher fidelities required for quantum information applications. Here we
demonstrate a hybrid approach in which optical excitation is used to change the
charge state (conditional on its spin state) of an erbium defect centre in a
silicon-based single-electron transistor, and this change is then detected
electrically. The high spectral resolution of the optical frequency-addressing
step overcomes the thermal broadening limitation of the previous electrical
read-out scheme, and the charge-sensing step avoids the difficulties of efficient
photon collection. This approach could lead to new architectures for quantum
information processing devices and could drastically increase the range of defect
centres that can be exploited. Furthermore, the efficient electrical detection of
the optical excitation of single sites in silicon represents a significant step
towards developing interconnects between optical-based quantum computing and
silicon technologies.

Protein synthesis in all cells is carried out by macromolecular machines called
ribosomes. Although the structures of prokaryotic, yeast and protist ribosomes
have been determined, the more complex molecular architecture of metazoan 80S
ribosomes has so far remained elusive. Here we present structures of Drosophila
melanogaster and Homo sapiens 80S ribosomes in complex with the translation
factor eEF2, E-site transfer RNA and Stm1-like proteins, based on high-resolution
cryo-electron-microscopy density maps. These structures not only illustrate the
co-evolution of metazoan-specific ribosomal RNA with ribosomal proteins but also 
reveal the presence of two additional structural layers in metazoan ribosomes, a 
well-ordered inner layer covered by a flexible RNA outer layer. The human and
Drosophila ribosome structures will provide the basis for more detailed
structural, biochemical and genetic experiments.

We performed an integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization
of 373 endometrial carcinomas using array- and sequencing-based technologies.
Uterine serous tumours and ∼25% of high-grade endometrioid tumours had extensive 
copy number alterations, few DNA methylation changes, low oestrogen
receptor/progesterone receptor levels, and frequent TP53 mutations. Most
endometrioid tumours had few copy number alterations or TP53 mutations, but
frequent mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, ARID1A and KRAS and novel mutations
in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene ARID5B. A subset of
endometrioid tumours that we identified had a markedly increased transversion
mutation frequency and newly identified hotspot mutations in POLE. Our results
classified endometrial cancers into four categories: POLE ultramutated,
microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, and copy-number high.
Uterine serous carcinomas share genomic features with ovarian serous and
basal-like breast carcinomas. We demonstrated that the genomic features of
endometrial carcinomas permit a reclassification that may affect post-surgical
adjuvant treatment for women with aggressive tumours.

With the global population predicted to grow by at least 25 per cent by 2050, the
need for sustainable production of nutritious foods is critical for human and
environmental health. Recent advances show that specialized plant membrane
transporters can be used to enhance yields of staple crops, increase nutrient
content and increase resistance to key stresses, including salinity, pathogens
and aluminium toxicity, which in turn could expand available arable land.

Globally networked risks and how to respond.

Today's strongly connected, global networks have produced highly interdependent
systems that we do not understand and cannot control well. These systems are
vulnerable to failure at all scales, posing serious threats to society, even when
external shocks are absent. As the complexity and interaction strengths in our
networked world increase, man-made systems can become unstable, creating
uncontrollable situations even when decision-makers are well-skilled, have all
data and technology at their disposal, and do their best. To make these systems
manageable, a fundamental redesign is needed. A 'Global Systems Science' might
create the required knowledge and paradigm shift in thinking.

The mushroom body in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is an associative brain
centre that translates odour representations into learned behavioural responses. 
Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, integrate input from
olfactory glomeruli to encode odours as sparse distributed patterns of neural
activity. We have developed anatomic tracing techniques to identify the
glomerular origin of the inputs that converge onto 200 individual Kenyon cells.
Here we show that each Kenyon cell integrates input from a different and
apparently random combination of glomeruli. The glomerular inputs to individual
Kenyon cells show no discernible organization with respect to their odour tuning,
anatomic features or developmental origins. Moreover, different classes of Kenyon
cells do not seem to preferentially integrate inputs from specific combinations
of glomeruli. This organization of glomerular connections to the mushroom body
could allow the fly to contextualize novel sensory experiences, a feature
consistent with the role of this brain centre in mediating learned olfactory
associations and behaviours.

Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most
intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on
entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical
physics. As well as being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique
resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled quantum 
bits (qubits) can be used to share private information or implement quantum
logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled
qubits are spatially separated, providing the opportunity to create highly
connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here
we report entanglement of two electron spin qubits in diamond with a spatial
separation of three metres. We establish this entanglement using a robust
protocol based on creation of spin-photon entanglement at each location and a
subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the
projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting
non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in
different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined
with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on
local long-lived nuclear spin registers, paving the way for deterministic
long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks.

Linking the evolution of body shape and locomotor biomechanics in bird-line
archosaurs.

Locomotion in living birds (Neornithes) has two remarkable features:
feather-assisted flight, and the use of unusually crouched hindlimbs for bipedal 
support and movement. When and how these defining functional traits evolved
remains controversial. However, the advent of computer modelling approaches and
the discoveries of exceptionally preserved key specimens now make it possible to 
use quantitative data on whole-body morphology to address the biomechanics
underlying this issue. Here we use digital body reconstructions to quantify
evolutionary trends in locomotor biomechanics (whole-body proportions and
centre-of-mass position) across the clade Archosauria. We use three-dimensional
digital reconstruction to estimate body shape from skeletal dimensions for 17
archosaurs along the ancestral bird line, including the exceptionally preserved, 
feathered taxa Microraptor, Archaeopteryx, Pengornis and Yixianornis, which
represent key stages in the evolution of the avian body plan. Rather than a
discrete transition from more-upright postures in the basal-most birds (Avialae) 
and their immediate outgroup deinonychosauria, our results support hypotheses of 
a gradual, stepwise acquisition of more-crouched limb postures across much of
theropod evolution, although we find evidence of an accelerated change within the
clade Maniraptora (birds and their closest relatives, such as deinonychosaurs).
In addition, whereas reduction of the tail is widely accepted to be the primary
morphological factor correlated with centre-of-mass position and, hence,
evolution of hindlimb posture, we instead find that enlargement of the pectoral
limb and several associated trends have a much stronger influence. Intriguingly, 
our support for the onset of accelerated morpho-functional trends within
Maniraptora is closely correlated with the evolution of flight. Because we find
that the evolution of enlarged forelimbs is strongly linked, via whole-body
centre of mass, to hindlimb function during terrestrial locomotion, we suggest
that the evolution of avian flight is linked to anatomical novelties in the
pelvic limb as well as the pectoral.

Long-term sedimentary recycling of rare sulphur isotope anomalies.

Reinhard CT(1), Planavsky NJ, Lyons TW.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of
Technology, Pasadena, California 91126, USA.

The accumulation of substantial quantities of O2 in the atmosphere has come to
control the chemistry and ecological structure of Earth's surface.
Non-mass-dependent (NMD) sulphur isotope anomalies in the rock record are the
central tool used to reconstruct the redox history of the early atmosphere. The
generation and initial delivery of these anomalies to marine sediments requires
low partial pressures of atmospheric O2 (p(O2); refs 2, 3), and the disappearance
of NMD anomalies from the rock record 2.32 billion years ago is thought to have
signalled a departure from persistently low atmospheric oxygen levels (less than 
about 10(-5) times the present atmospheric level) during approximately the first 
two billion years of Earth's history. Here we present a model study designed to
describe the long-term surface recycling of crustal NMD anomalies, and show that 
the record of this geochemical signal is likely to display a 'crustal memory
effect' following increases in atmospheric p(O2) above this threshold. Once NMD
anomalies have been buried in the upper crust they are extremely resistant to
removal, and can be erased only through successive cycles of weathering, dilution
and burial on an oxygenated Earth surface. This recycling results in the residual
incorporation of NMD anomalies into the sedimentary record long after synchronous
atmospheric generation of the isotopic signal has ceased, with dynamic and
measurable signals probably surviving for as long as 10-100 million years
subsequent to an increase in atmospheric p(O2) to more than 10(-5) times the
present atmospheric level. Our results can reconcile geochemical evidence for
oxygen production and transient accumulation with the maintenance of NMD
anomalies on the early Earth, and suggest that future work should investigate the
notion that temporally continuous generation of new NMD sulphur isotope anomalies
in the atmosphere was likely to have ceased long before their ultimate
disappearance from the rock record.

The catalytic mechanism for aerobic formation of methane by bacteria.

USA.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is produced in significant quantities by 
aerobic marine organisms. These bacteria apparently catalyse the formation of
methane through the cleavage of the highly unreactive carbon-phosphorus bond in
methyl phosphonate (MPn), but the biological or terrestrial source of this
compound is unclear. However, the ocean-dwelling bacterium Nitrosopumilus
maritimus catalyses the biosynthesis of MPn from 2-hydroxyethyl phosphonate and
the bacterial C-P lyase complex is known to convert MPn to methane. In addition
to MPn, the bacterial C-P lyase complex catalyses C-P bond cleavage of many alkyl
phosphonates when the environmental concentration of phosphate is low. PhnJ from 
the C-P lyase complex catalyses an unprecedented C-P bond cleavage reaction of
ribose-1-phosphonate-5-phosphate to methane and
ribose-1,2-cyclic-phosphate-5-phosphate. This reaction requires a redox-active
[4Fe-4S]-cluster and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is reductively cleaved to
L-methionine and 5'-deoxyadenosine. Here we show that PhnJ is a novel radical
S-adenosyl-L-methionine enzyme that catalyses C-P bond cleavage through the
initial formation of a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and two protein-based radicals
localized at Gly 32 and Cys 272. During this transformation, the pro-R hydrogen
from Gly 32 is transferred to the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical to form
5'-deoxyadenosine and the pro-S hydrogen is transferred to the radical
intermediate that ultimately generates methane. A comprehensive reaction
mechanism is proposed for cleavage of the C-P bond by the C-P lyase complex that 
uses a covalent thiophosphate intermediate for methane and phosphate formation.

Transcript function is determined by sequence elements arranged on an individual 
RNA molecule. Variation in transcripts can affect messenger RNA stability,
localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in
localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript
isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires
identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions
that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for
millions of RNA molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity
previously hidden among overlapping RNA molecules. Variation in transcript
boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single
population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding
gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding RNAs and truncated
versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript
isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70% of genes
express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory
elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic
transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively
simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically
homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome
compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data
also indicate that isoform diversity as well as RNA abundance should be
considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes.

Tension sensing by Aurora B kinase is independent of survivin-based centromere
localization.

Campbell CS(1), Desai A.

Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.

Accurate segregation of the replicated genome requires chromosome biorientation
on the spindle. Biorientation is ensured by Aurora B kinase (Ipl1), a member of
the four-subunit chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). Localization of the CPC to 
the inner centromere is central to the current model for how tension ensures
chromosome biorientation: kinetochore-spindle attachments that are not under
tension remain close to the inner centromere and are destabilized by Aurora B
phosphorylation, whereas kinetochores under tension are pulled away from the
influence of Aurora B, stabilizing their microtubule attachments. Here we show
that an engineered truncation of the Sli15 (known as INCENP in humans) subunit of
budding yeast CPC that eliminates association with the inner centromere
nevertheless supports proper chromosome segregation during both mitosis and
meiosis. Truncated Sli15 suppresses the deletion phenotypes of the
inner-centromere-targeting proteins survivin (Bir1), borealin (Nbl1), Bub1 and
Sgo1 (ref. 6). Unlike wild-type Sli15, truncated Sli15 localizes to pre-anaphase 
spindle microtubules. Premature targeting of full-length Sli15 to microtubules by
preventing Cdk1 (also known as Cdc28) phosphorylation also suppresses the
inviability of Bir1 deletion. These results suggest that activation of Aurora B
kinase by clustering either on chromatin or on microtubules is sufficient for
chromosome biorientation.

The functions of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are primarily mediated and
modulated by three families of proteins: the heterotrimeric G proteins, the
G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and the arrestins. G proteins mediate
activation of second-messenger-generating enzymes and other effectors, GRKs
phosphorylate activated receptors, and arrestins subsequently bind phosphorylated
receptors and cause receptor desensitization. Arrestins activated by interaction 
with phosphorylated receptors can also mediate G-protein-independent signalling
by serving as adaptors to link receptors to numerous signalling pathways. Despite
their central role in regulation and signalling of GPCRs, a structural
understanding of β-arrestin activation and interaction with GPCRs is still
lacking. Here we report the crystal structure of β-arrestin-1 (also called
arrestin-2) in complex with a fully phosphorylated 29-amino-acid carboxy-terminal
peptide derived from the human V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp). This peptide has 
previously been shown to functionally and conformationally activate β-arrestin-1 
(ref. 5). To capture this active conformation, we used a conformationally
selective synthetic antibody fragment (Fab30) that recognizes the
phosphopeptide-activated state of β-arrestin-1. The structure of the
β-arrestin-1-V2Rpp-Fab30 complex shows marked conformational differences in
β-arrestin-1 compared to its inactive conformation. These include rotation of the
amino- and carboxy-terminal domains relative to each other, and a major
reorientation of the 'lariat loop' implicated in maintaining the inactive state
of β-arrestin-1. These results reveal, at high resolution, a receptor-interacting
interface on β-arrestin, and they indicate a potentially general molecular
mechanism for activation of these multifunctional signalling and regulatory
proteins.

Arrestins interact with G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to block interaction 
with G proteins and initiate G-protein-independent signalling. Arrestins have a
bi-lobed structure that is stabilized by a long carboxy-terminal tail (C-tail),
and displacement of the C-tail by receptor-attached phosphates activates
arrestins for binding active GPCRs. Structures of the inactive state of arrestin 
are available, but it is not known how C-tail displacement activates arrestin for
receptor coupling. Here we present a 3.0 Å crystal structure of the bovine
arrestin-1 splice variant p44, in which the activation step is mimicked by C-tail
truncation. The structure of this pre-activated arrestin is profoundly different 
from the basal state and gives insight into the activation mechanism. p44
displays breakage of the central polar core and other interlobe hydrogen-bond
networks, leading to a ∼21° rotation of the two lobes as compared to basal
arrestin-1. Rearrangements in key receptor-binding loops in the central crest
region include the finger loop, loop 139 (refs 8, 10, 11) and the sequence
Asp 296-Asn 305 (or gate loop), here identified as controlling the polar core. We
verified the role of these conformational alterations in arrestin activation and 
receptor binding by site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. The data indicate a 
mechanism for arrestin activation in which C-tail displacement releases critical 
central-crest loops from restricted to extended receptor-interacting
conformations. In parallel, increased flexibility between the two lobes
facilitates a proper fitting of arrestin to the active receptor surface. Our
results provide a snapshot of an arrestin ready to bind the active receptor, and 
give an insight into the role of naturally occurring truncated arrestins in the
visual system.

Effective navigation requires planning extended routes to remembered goal
locations. Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in
navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that
before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates
brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from
the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict 
immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of
start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal
sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as 
'replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding
mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at
specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be
used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.

Cancers acquire resistance to systemic treatment as a result of clonal evolution 
and selection. Repeat biopsies to study genomic evolution as a result of therapy 
are difficult, invasive and may be confounded by intra-tumour heterogeneity.
Recent studies have shown that genomic alterations in solid cancers can be
characterized by massively parallel sequencing of circulating cell-free tumour
DNA released from cancer cells into plasma, representing a non-invasive liquid
biopsy. Here we report sequencing of cancer exomes in serial plasma samples to
track genomic evolution of metastatic cancers in response to therapy. Six
patients with advanced breast, ovarian and lung cancers were followed over 1-2
years. For each case, exome sequencing was performed on 2-5 plasma samples (19 in
total) spanning multiple courses of treatment, at selected time points when the
allele fraction of tumour mutations in plasma was high, allowing improved
sensitivity. For two cases, synchronous biopsies were also analysed, confirming
genome-wide representation of the tumour genome in plasma. Quantification of
allele fractions in plasma identified increased representation of mutant alleles 
in association with emergence of therapy resistance. These included an activating
mutation in PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic
subunit alpha) following treatment with paclitaxel; a truncating mutation in RB1 
(retinoblastoma 1) following treatment with cisplatin; a truncating mutation in
MED1 (mediator complex subunit 1) following treatment with tamoxifen and
trastuzumab, and following subsequent treatment with lapatinib, a splicing
mutation in GAS6 (growth arrest-specific 6) in the same patient; and a
resistance-conferring mutation in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor; T790M) 
following treatment with gefitinib. These results establish proof of principle
that exome-wide analysis of circulating tumour DNA could complement current
invasive biopsy approaches to identify mutations associated with acquired drug
resistance in advanced cancers. Serial analysis of cancer genomes in plasma
constitutes a new paradigm for the study of clonal evolution in human cancers.

Modulation of TET2 expression and 5-methylcytosine oxidation by the CXXC domain
protein IDAX.

TET (ten-eleven-translocation) proteins are Fe(ii)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent
dioxygenases that modify the methylation status of DNA by successively oxidizing 
5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and
5-carboxycytosine, potential intermediates in the active erasure of
DNA-methylation marks. Here we show that IDAX (also known as CXXC4), a reported
inhibitor of Wnt signalling that has been implicated in malignant renal cell
carcinoma and colonic villous adenoma, regulates TET2 protein expression. IDAX
was originally encoded within an ancestral TET2 gene that underwent a chromosomal
gene inversion during evolution, thus separating the TET2 CXXC domain from the
catalytic domain. The IDAX CXXC domain binds DNA sequences containing
unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, localizes to promoters and CpG islands in genomic
DNA and interacts directly with the catalytic domain of TET2. Unexpectedly, IDAX 
expression results in caspase activation and TET2 protein downregulation, in a
manner that depends on DNA binding through the IDAX CXXC domain, suggesting that 
IDAX recruits TET2 to DNA before degradation. IDAX depletion prevents TET2
downregulation in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, and short hairpin
RNA against IDAX increases TET2 protein expression in the human monocytic cell
line U937. Notably, we find that the expression and activity of TET3 is also
regulated through its CXXC domain. Taken together, these results establish the
separate and linked CXXC domains of TET2 and TET3, respectively, as previously
unknown regulators of caspase activation and TET enzymatic activity.

Germinal centres support antibody affinity maturation and memory formation.
Follicular T-helper cells promote proliferation and differentiation of
antigen-specific B cells inside the follicle. A genetic deficiency in the
inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), a classic CD28 family co-stimulatory molecule
highly expressed by follicular T-helper cells, causes profound germinal centre
defects, leading to the view that ICOS specifically co-stimulates the follicular 
T-helper cell differentiation program. Here we show that ICOS directly controls
follicular recruitment of activated T-helper cells in mice. This effect is
independent from ICOS ligand (ICOSL)-mediated co-stimulation provided by
antigen-presenting dendritic cells or cognate B cells, and does not rely on
Bcl6-mediated programming as an intermediate step. Instead, it requires ICOSL
expression by follicular bystander B cells, which do not present cognate antigen 
to T-helper cells but collectively form an ICOS-engaging field. Dynamic imaging
reveals ICOS engagement drives coordinated pseudopod formation and promotes
persistent T-cell migration at the border between the T-cell zone and the B-cell 
follicle in vivo. When follicular bystander B cells cannot express ICOSL,
otherwise competent T-helper cells fail to develop into follicular T-helper cells
normally, and fail to promote optimal germinal centre responses. These results
demonstrate a co-stimulation-independent function of ICOS, uncover a key role for
bystander B cells in promoting the development of follicular T-helper cells, and 
reveal unsuspected sophistication in dynamic T-cell positioning in vivo.

Anomalous sulphur isotopes in plume lavas reveal deep mantle storage of Archaean 
crust.

Basaltic lavas erupted at some oceanic intraplate hotspot volcanoes are thought
to sample ancient subducted crustal materials. However, the residence time of
these subducted materials in the mantle is uncertain and model-dependent, and
compelling evidence for their return to the surface in regions of mantle
upwelling beneath hotspots is lacking. Here we report anomalous sulphur isotope
signatures indicating mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in olivine-hosted
sulphides from 20-million-year-old ocean island basalts from Mangaia, Cook
Islands (Polynesia), which have been suggested to sample recycled oceanic crust. 
Terrestrial MIF sulphur isotope signatures (in which the amount of fractionation 
does not scale in proportion with the difference in the masses of the isotopes)
were generated exclusively through atmospheric photochemical reactions until
about 2.45 billion years ago. Therefore, the discovery of MIF sulphur in these
young plume lavas suggests that sulphur--probably derived from hydrothermally
altered oceanic crust--was subducted into the mantle before 2.45 billion years
ago and recycled into the mantle source of Mangaia lavas. These new data provide 
evidence for ancient materials, with negative Δ(33)S values, in the mantle source
for Mangaia lavas. Our data also complement evidence for recycling of the sulphur
content of ancient sedimentary materials to the subcontinental lithospheric
mantle that has been identified in diamond-hosted sulphide inclusions. This
Archaean age for recycled oceanic crust also provides key constraints on the
length of time that subducted crustal material can survive in the mantle, and on 
the timescales of mantle convection from subduction to upwelling beneath
hotspots.

Magnetic imaging is a powerful tool for probing biological and physical systems. 
However, existing techniques either have poor spatial resolution compared to
optical microscopy and are hence not generally applicable to imaging of
sub-cellular structure (for example, magnetic resonance imaging), or entail
operating conditions that preclude application to living biological samples while
providing submicrometre resolution (for example, scanning superconducting quantum
interference device microscopy, electron holography and magnetic resonance force 
microscopy). Here we demonstrate magnetic imaging of living cells (magnetotactic 
bacteria) under ambient laboratory conditions and with sub-cellular spatial
resolution (400 nanometres), using an optically detected magnetic field imaging
array consisting of a nanometre-scale layer of nitrogen-vacancy colour centres
implanted at the surface of a diamond chip. With the bacteria placed on the
diamond surface, we optically probe the nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states and 
rapidly reconstruct images of the vector components of the magnetic field created
by chains of magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) produced in the bacteria. We
also spatially correlate these magnetic field maps with optical images acquired
in the same apparatus. Wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical and magnetic
imaging of multiple cells in a population with submicrometre resolution and a
field of view in excess of 100 micrometres. Scanning electron microscope images
of the bacteria confirm that the correlated optical and magnetic images can be
used to locate and characterize the magnetosomes in each bacterium. Our results
provide a new capability for imaging bio-magnetic structures in living cells
under ambient conditions with high spatial resolution, and will enable the
mapping of a wide range of magnetic signals within cells and cellular networks.

Accurate assessment of mass, models and resolution by small-angle scattering.

Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA. rprambo@lbl.gov

Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with X-rays or neutrons provide a
comprehensive, resolution-limited observation of the thermodynamic state.
However, methods for evaluating mass and validating SAS-based models and
resolution have been inadequate. Here we define the volume of correlation, Vc, a 
SAS invariant derived from the scattered intensities that is specific to the
structural state of the particle, but independent of concentration and the
requirements of a compact, folded particle. We show that Vc defines a ratio, QR, 
that determines the molecular mass of proteins or RNA ranging from 10 to 1,000
kilodaltons. Furthermore, we propose a statistically robust method for assessing 
model-data agreements (χ(2)free) akin to cross-validation. Our approach prevents 
over-fitting of the SAS data and can be used with a newly defined metric, RSAS,
for quantitative evaluation of resolution. Together, these metrics (Vc, QR,
χ(2)free and RSAS) provide analytical tools for unbiased and accurate
macromolecular structural characterizations in solution.

Quantum computation and cryptography both involve scenarios in which a user
interacts with an imperfectly modelled or 'untrusted' system. It is therefore of 
fundamental and practical interest to devise tests that reveal whether the system
is behaving as instructed. In 1969, Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt proposed an 
experimental test that can be passed by a quantum-mechanical system but not by a 
system restricted to classical physics. Here we extend this test to enable the
characterization of a large quantum system. We describe a scheme that can be used
to determine the initial state and to classically command the system to evolve
according to desired dynamics. The bipartite system is treated as two black
boxes, with no assumptions about their inner workings except that they obey
quantum physics. The scheme works even if the system is explicitly designed to
undermine it; any misbehaviour is detected. Among its applications, our scheme
makes it possible to test whether a claimed quantum computer is truly quantum. It
also advances towards a goal of quantum cryptography: namely, the use of
'untrusted' devices to establish a shared random key, with security based on the 
validity of quantum physics.

Macrophages, the most plastic cells of the haematopoietic system, are found in
all tissues and show great functional diversity. They have roles in development, 
homeostasis, tissue repair and immunity. Although tissue macrophages are
anatomically distinct from one another, and have different transcriptional
profiles and functional capabilities, they are all required for the maintenance
of homeostasis. However, these reparative and homeostatic functions can be
subverted by chronic insults, resulting in a causal association of macrophages
with disease states. In this Review, we discuss how macrophages regulate normal
physiology and development, and provide several examples of their
pathophysiological roles in disease. We define the 'hallmarks' of macrophages
according to the states that they adopt during the performance of their various
roles, taking into account new insights into the diversity of their lineages,
identities and regulation. It is essential to understand this diversity because
macrophages have emerged as important therapeutic targets in many human diseases.

Zebrafish have become a popular organism for the study of vertebrate gene
function. The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to
accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the
widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene
function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for
effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the
extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous
human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of
the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced
large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution
high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides
evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any
vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that 
approximately 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. 
In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer
understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity
of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and
chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.

Since the publication of the human reference genome, the identities of specific
genes associated with human diseases are being discovered at a rapid rate. A
central problem is that the biological activity of these genes is often unclear. 
Detailed investigations in model vertebrate organisms, typically mice, have been 
essential for understanding the activities of many orthologues of these
disease-associated genes. Although gene-targeting approaches and phenotype
analysis have led to a detailed understanding of nearly 6,000 protein-coding
genes, this number falls considerably short of the more than 22,000 mouse
protein-coding genes. Similarly, in zebrafish genetics, one-by-one gene studies
using positional cloning, insertional mutagenesis, antisense morpholino
oligonucleotides, targeted re-sequencing, and zinc finger and TAL endonucleases
have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the biological
activity of vertebrate genes, but again the number of genes studied falls well
short of the more than 26,000 zebrafish protein-coding genes. Importantly, for
both mice and zebrafish, none of these strategies are particularly suited to the 
rapid generation of knockouts in thousands of genes and the assessment of their
biological activity. Here we describe an active project that aims to identify and
phenotype the disruptive mutations in every zebrafish protein-coding gene, using 
a well-annotated zebrafish reference genome sequence, high-throughput sequencing 
and efficient chemical mutagenesis. So far we have identified potentially
disruptive mutations in more than 38% of all known zebrafish protein-coding
genes. We have developed a multi-allelic phenotyping scheme to efficiently assess
the effects of each allele during embryogenesis and have analysed the phenotypic 
consequences of over 1,000 alleles. All mutant alleles and data are available to 
the community and our phenotyping scheme is adaptable to phenotypic analysis
beyond embryogenesis.

The geometric aspects of quantum mechanics are emphasized most prominently by the
concept of geometric phases, which are acquired whenever a quantum system evolves
along a path in Hilbert space, that is, the space of quantum states of the
system. The geometric phase is determined only by the shape of this path and is, 
in its simplest form, a real number. However, if the system has degenerate energy
levels, then matrix-valued geometric state transformations, known as non-Abelian 
holonomies--the effect of which depends on the order of two consecutive
paths--can be obtained. They are important, for example, for the creation of
synthetic gauge fields in cold atomic gases or the description of non-Abelian
anyon statistics. Moreover, there are proposals to exploit non-Abelian holonomic 
gates for the purposes of noise-resilient quantum computation. In contrast to
Abelian geometric operations, non-Abelian ones have been observed only in nuclear
quadrupole resonance experiments with a large number of spins, and without full
characterization of the geometric process and its non-commutative nature. Here we
realize non-Abelian non-adiabatic holonomic quantum operations on a single,
superconducting, artificial three-level atom by applying a well-controlled,
two-tone microwave drive. Using quantum process tomography, we determine
fidelities of the resulting non-commuting gates that exceed 95 per cent. We show 
that two different quantum gates, originating from two distinct paths in Hilbert 
space, yield non-equivalent transformations when applied in different orders.
This provides evidence for the non-Abelian character of the implemented holonomic
quantum operations. In combination with a non-trivial two-quantum-bit gate, our
method suggests a way to universal holonomic quantum computing.

In 2010 there were more than 200 million cases of malaria, and at least 655,000
deaths. The World Health Organization has recommended artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by
the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide
with potent antimalarial properties, produced by the plant Artemisia annua.
However, the supply of plant-derived artemisinin is unstable, resulting in
shortages and price fluctuations, complicating production planning by ACT
manufacturers. A stable source of affordable artemisinin is required. Here we use
synthetic biology to develop strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) 
for high-yielding biological production of artemisinic acid, a precursor of
artemisinin. Previous attempts to produce commercially relevant concentrations of
artemisinic acid were unsuccessful, allowing production of only 1.6 grams per
litre of artemisinic acid. Here we demonstrate the complete biosynthetic pathway,
including the discovery of a plant dehydrogenase and a second cytochrome that
provide an efficient biosynthetic route to artemisinic acid, with fermentation
titres of 25 grams per litre of artemisinic acid. Furthermore, we have developed 
a practical, efficient and scalable chemical process for the conversion of
artemisinic acid to artemisinin using a chemical source of singlet oxygen, thus
avoiding the need for specialized photochemical equipment. The strains and
processes described here form the basis of a viable industrial process for the
production of semi-synthetic artemisinin to stabilize the supply of artemisinin
for derivatization into active pharmaceutical ingredients (for example,
artesunate) for incorporation into ACTs. Because all intellectual property rights
have been provided free of charge, this technology has the potential to increase 
provision of first-line antimalarial treatments to the developing world at a
reduced average annual price.

Dengue is a systemic viral infection transmitted between humans by Aedes
mosquitoes. For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness. There are
currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector
control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread. The
contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection and its
public health burden are poorly known. Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly
of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling
framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the
resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort
studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in
2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local
spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the
degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be
390 million (95% credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 
96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This
infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World 
Health Organization. Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison
with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an
apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are
discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights
into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue. We
anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about
the global impact of this disease and will help to guide improvements in disease 
control strategies using vaccine, drug and vector control methods, and in their
economic evaluation.

Membranes allow the compartmentalization of biochemical processes and are
therefore fundamental to life. The conservation of the cellular membrane,
combined with its accessibility to secreted proteins, has made it a common target
of factors mediating antagonistic interactions between diverse organisms. Here we
report the discovery of a diverse superfamily of bacterial phospholipase enzymes.
Within this superfamily, we defined enzymes with phospholipase A1 and A2
activity, which are common in host-cell-targeting bacterial toxins and the venoms
of certain insects and reptiles. However, we find that the fundamental role of
the superfamily is to mediate antagonistic bacterial interactions as effectors of
the type VI secretion system (T6SS) translocation apparatus; accordingly, we name
these proteins type VI lipase effectors. Our analyses indicate that PldA of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a eukaryotic-like phospholipase D, is a member of the
type VI lipase effector superfamily and the founding substrate of the haemolysin 
co-regulated protein secretion island II T6SS (H2-T6SS). Although previous
studies have specifically implicated PldA and the H2-T6SS in pathogenesis, we
uncovered a specific role for the effector and its secretory machinery in intra- 
and interspecies bacterial interactions. Furthermore, we find that this effector 
achieves its antibacterial activity by degrading phosphatidylethanolamine, the
major component of bacterial membranes. The surprising finding that
virulence-associated phospholipases can serve as specific antibacterial effectors
suggests that interbacterial interactions are a relevant factor driving the
continuing evolution of pathogenesis.

Current human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) vaccines elicit strain-specific
neutralizing antibodies. However, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise in
approximately 20% of HIV-1-infected individuals, and details of their generation 
could provide a blueprint for effective vaccination. Here we report the
isolation, evolution and structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody from an
African donor followed from the time of infection. The mature antibody, CH103,
neutralized approximately 55% of HIV-1 isolates, and its co-crystal structure
with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 revealed a new loop-based mechanism of
CD4-binding-site recognition. Virus and antibody gene sequencing revealed
concomitant virus evolution and antibody maturation. Notably, the unmutated
common ancestor of the CH103 lineage avidly bound the transmitted/founder HIV-1
envelope glycoprotein, and evolution of antibody neutralization breadth was
preceded by extensive viral diversification in and near the CH103 epitope. These 
data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage
of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to
elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.

Phosphate is crucial for structural and metabolic needs, including nucleotide and
lipid synthesis, signalling and chemical energy storage. Proton-coupled
transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are essential for
phosphate uptake in plants and fungi, and also have a function in sensing
external phosphate levels as transceptors. Here we report the 2.9 Å structure of 
a fungal (Piriformospora indica) high-affinity phosphate transporter, PiPT, in an
inward-facing occluded state, with bound phosphate visible in the membrane-buried
binding site. The structure indicates both proton and phosphate exit pathways and
suggests a modified asymmetrical 'rocker-switch' mechanism of phosphate
transport. PiPT is related to several human transporter families, most notably
the organic cation and anion transporters of the solute carrier family (SLC22),
which are implicated in cancer-drug resistance. We modelled representative cation
and anion SLC22 transporters based on the PiPT structure to surmise the
structural basis for substrate binding and charge selectivity in this important
family. The PiPT structure demonstrates and expands on principles of substrate
transport by the MFS transporters and illuminates principles of phosphate uptake 
in particular.

There has been a marked increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases in the
past half-century. Although the underlying genetic basis of this class of
diseases has recently been elucidated, implicating predominantly immune-response 
genes, changes in environmental factors must ultimately be driving this increase.
The newly identified population of interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) helper T 
cells (TH17 cells) has a pivotal role in autoimmune diseases. Pathogenic
IL-23-dependent TH17 cells have been shown to be critical for the development of 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple
sclerosis, and genetic risk factors associated with multiple sclerosis are
related to the IL-23-TH17 pathway. However, little is known about the
environmental factors that directly influence TH17 cells. Here we show that
increased salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) concentrations found locally under
physiological conditions in vivo markedly boost the induction of murine and human
TH17 cells. High-salt conditions activate the p38/MAPK pathway involving nuclear 
factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5; also called TONEBP) and
serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) during cytokine-induced TH17
polarization. Gene silencing or chemical inhibition of p38/MAPK, NFAT5 or SGK1
abrogates the high-salt-induced TH17 cell development. The TH17 cells generated
under high-salt conditions display a highly pathogenic and stable phenotype
characterized by the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, TNF-α
and IL-2. Moreover, mice fed with a high-salt diet develop a more severe form of 
EAE, in line with augmented central nervous system infiltrating and peripherally 
induced antigen-specific TH17 cells. Thus, increased dietary salt intake might
represent an environmental risk factor for the development of autoimmune diseases
through the induction of pathogenic TH17 cells.

Despite their importance, the molecular circuits that control the differentiation
of naive T cells remain largely unknown. Recent studies that reconstructed
regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and
relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary
T cells. Here we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution,
novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based perturbation tools 
to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic
regulatory network that controls the differentiation of mouse TH17 cells, a
proinflammatory T-cell subset that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
multiple autoimmune diseases. The TH17 transcriptional network consists of two
self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators,
the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between 
TH17 and other CD4(+) T-cell subsets. Our study identifies and validates 39
regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and
reveals its organizational principles; it also highlights novel drug targets for 
controlling TH17 cell differentiation.

TH17 cells (interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing helper T cells) are highly
proinflammatory cells that are critical for clearing extracellular pathogens and 
for inducing multiple autoimmune diseases. IL-23 has a critical role in
stabilizing and reinforcing the TH17 phenotype by increasing expression of IL-23 
receptor (IL-23R) and endowing TH17 cells with pathogenic effector functions.
However, the precise molecular mechanism by which IL-23 sustains the TH17
response and induces pathogenic effector functions has not been elucidated. Here 
we used transcriptional profiling of developing TH17 cells to construct a model
of their signalling network and nominate major nodes that regulate TH17
development. We identified serum glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1), a
serine/threonine kinase, as an essential node downstream of IL-23 signalling.
SGK1 is critical for regulating IL-23R expression and stabilizing the TH17 cell
phenotype by deactivation of mouse Foxo1, a direct repressor of IL-23R
expression. SGK1 has been shown to govern Na(+) transport and salt (NaCl)
homeostasis in other cells. We show here that a modest increase in salt
concentration induces SGK1 expression, promotes IL-23R expression and enhances
TH17 cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo, accelerating the development of
autoimmunity. Loss of SGK1 abrogated Na(+)-mediated TH17 differentiation in an
IL-23-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that SGK1 has a critical role in
the induction of pathogenic TH17 cells and provide a molecular insight into a
mechanism by which an environmental factor such as a high salt diet triggers TH17
development and promotes tissue inflammation.

Ultrafast processes can now be studied with the combined atomic spatial
resolution of diffraction methods and the temporal resolution of femtosecond
optical spectroscopy by using femtosecond pulses of electrons or hard X-rays as
structural probes. However, it is challenging to apply these methods to organic
materials, which have weak scattering centres, thermal lability, and poor heat
conduction. These characteristics mean that the source needs to be extremely
bright to enable us to obtain high-quality diffraction data before cumulative
heating effects from the laser excitation either degrade the sample or mask the
structural dynamics. Here we show that a recently developed, ultrabright
femtosecond electron source makes it possible to monitor the molecular motions in
the organic salt (EDO-TTF)2PF6 as it undergoes its photo-induced
insulator-to-metal phase transition. After the ultrafast laser excitation, we
record time-delayed diffraction patterns that allow us to identify hundreds of
Bragg reflections with which to map the structural evolution of the system. The
data and supporting model calculations indicate the formation of a transient
intermediate structure in the early stage of charge delocalization (less than
five picoseconds), and reveal that the molecular motions driving its formation
are distinct from those that, assisted by thermal relaxation, convert the system 
into a metallic state on the hundred-picosecond timescale. These findings
establish the potential of ultrabright femtosecond electron sources for probing
the primary processes governing structural dynamics with atomic resolution in
labile systems relevant to chemistry and biology.

Detection of nuclear spin precession is critical for a wide range of scientific
techniques that have applications in diverse fields including analytical
chemistry, materials science, medicine and biology. Fundamentally, it is possible
because of the extreme isolation of nuclear spins from their environment. This
isolation also makes single nuclear spins desirable for quantum-information
processing, as shown by pioneering studies on nitrogen-vacancy centres in
diamond. The nuclear spin of a (31)P donor in silicon is very promising as a
quantum bit: bulk measurements indicate that it has excellent coherence times and
silicon is the dominant material in the microelectronics industry. Here we
demonstrate electrical detection and coherent manipulation of a single (31)P
nuclear spin qubit with sufficiently high fidelities for fault-tolerant quantum
computing. By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin with on-chip
electron spin resonance, we demonstrate quantum non-demolition and electrical
single-shot readout of the nuclear spin with a readout fidelity higher than 99.8 
percent-the highest so far reported for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear
spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radio-frequency pulses. For
an ionized (31)P donor, we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 milliseconds 
and a one-qubit gate control fidelity exceeding 98 percent. These results
demonstrate that the dominant technology of modern electronics can be adapted to 
host a complete electrical measurement and control platform for
nuclear-spin-based quantum-information processing.

Massive present-day early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies probably
gained the bulk of their stellar mass and heavy elements through intense,
dust-enshrouded starbursts--that is, increased rates of star formation--in the
most massive dark-matter haloes at early epochs. However, it remains unknown how 
soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured
redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to
be biased low in z owing to selection effects, as confirmed by recent findings of
systems with redshifts as high as ~5 (refs 2-4). Here we report the
identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z = 6.34 through a submillimetre 
colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite
of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a
hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically evolved interstellar
medium in this galaxy, which constitutes at least 40 per cent of the baryonic
mass. A 'maximum starburst' converts the gas into stars at a rate more than 2,000
times that of the Milky Way, a rate among the highest observed at any epoch.
Despite the overall downturn in cosmic star formation towards the highest
redshifts, it seems that environments mature enough to form the most massive,
intense starbursts existed at least as early as 880 million years after the Big
Bang.

In bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants the Trk, Ktr and HKT ion transporters are 
key components of osmotic regulation, pH homeostasis and resistance to drought
and high salinity. These ion transporters are functionally diverse: they can
function as Na(+) or K(+) channels and possibly as cation/K(+) symporters. They
are closely related to potassium channels both at the level of the membrane
protein and at the level of the cytosolic regulatory domains. Here we describe
the crystal structure of a Ktr K(+) transporter, the KtrAB complex from Bacillus 
subtilis. The structure shows the dimeric membrane protein KtrB assembled with a 
cytosolic octameric KtrA ring bound to ATP, an activating ligand. A comparison
between the structure of KtrAB-ATP and the structures of the isolated full-length
KtrA protein with ATP or ADP reveals a ligand-dependent conformational change in 
the octameric ring, raising new ideas about the mechanism of activation in these 
transporters.

TrkH belongs to a superfamily of K(+) transport proteins required for growth of
bacteria in low external K(+) concentrations. The crystal structure of TrkH from 
Vibrio parahaemolyticus showed that TrkH resembles a K(+) channel and may have a 
gating mechanism substantially different from K(+) channels. TrkH assembles with 
TrkA, a cytosolic protein comprising two RCK (regulate the conductance of K(+))
domains, which are found in certain K(+) channels and control their gating.
However, fundamental questions on whether TrkH is an ion channel and how it is
regulated by TrkA remain unresolved. Here we show single-channel activity of TrkH
that is upregulated by ATP via TrkA. We report two structures of the tetrameric
TrkA ring, one in complex with TrkH and one in isolation, in which the ring
assumes two markedly different conformations. These results suggest a mechanism
for how ATP increases TrkH activity by inducing conformational changes in TrkA.

The discovery of a living coelacanth specimen in 1938 was remarkable, as this
lineage of lobe-finned fish was thought to have become extinct 70 million years
ago. The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient
relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a
glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence
of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, 
we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living
relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more
slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses 
of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to
land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development
of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers
involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic
tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for
understanding tetrapod evolution.

Pottery was a hunter-gatherer innovation that first emerged in East Asia between 
20,000 and 12,000 calibrated years before present (cal bp), towards the end of
the Late Pleistocene epoch, a period of time when humans were adjusting to
changing climates and new environments. Ceramic container technologies were one
of a range of late glacial adaptations that were pivotal to structuring
subsequent cultural trajectories in different regions of the world, but the
reasons for their emergence and widespread uptake are poorly understood. The
first ceramic containers must have provided prehistoric hunter-gatherers with
attractive new strategies for processing and consuming foodstuffs, but virtually 
nothing is known of how early pots were used. Here we report the chemical
analysis of food residues associated with Late Pleistocene pottery, focusing on
one of the best-studied prehistoric ceramic sequences in the world, the Japanese 
Jōmon. We demonstrate that lipids can be recovered reliably from charred surface 
deposits adhering to pottery dating from about 15,000 to 11,800 cal bp (the
Incipient Jōmon period), the oldest pottery so far investigated, and that in most
cases these organic compounds are unequivocally derived from processing
freshwater and marine organisms. Stable isotope data support the lipid evidence
and suggest that most of the 101 charred deposits analysed, from across the major
islands of Japan, were derived from high-trophic-level aquatic food. Productive
aquatic ecotones were heavily exploited by late glacial foragers, perhaps
providing an initial impetus for investment in ceramic container technology, and 
paving the way for further intensification of pottery use by hunter-gatherers in 
the early Holocene epoch. Now that we have shown that it is possible to analyse
organic residues from some of the world's earliest ceramic vessels, the
subsequent development of this critical technology can be clarified through
further widespread testing of hunter-gatherer pottery from later periods.

Unexpected strain-stiffening in crystalline solids.

Strain-stiffening--an increase in material stiffness at large strains--is a vital
mechanism by which many soft biological materials thwart excessive deformation to
protect tissue integrity. Understanding the fundamental science of
strain-stiffening and incorporating this concept into the design of metals and
ceramics for advanced applications is an attractive prospect. Using cementite
(Fe3C) and aluminium borocarbide (Al3BC3) as prototypes, here we show via
quantum-mechanical calculations that strain-stiffening also occurs, surprisingly,
in simple inorganic crystalline solids and confers exceptionally high strengths
to these two solids, which have anomalously low resistance to deformation near
equilibrium. For Fe3C and Al3BC3, their ideal shear strength to shear modulus
ratios attain remarkably high values of 1.14 and 1.34 along the (010)[001] and
slip systems, respectively. These values are more than seven times larger than
the original Frenkel value of 1/2π (refs 4, 5) and are the highest yet reported
for crystalline solids. The extraordinary stiffening of Fe3C arises from the
strain-induced reversible 'cross-linking' between weakly coupled edge- and
corner-sharing Fe6C slabs. This new bond formation creates a strong,
three-dimensional covalent bond network that resists large shear deformation.
Unlike Fe3C, no new bond forms in Al3BC3 but stiffening still occurs because
strong repulsion between Al and B in a compressed Al-B bond unsettles the
existing covalent bond network. These discoveries challenge the conventional
wisdom that large shear modulus is a reliable predictor of hardness and strength 
of materials, and provide new lessons for materials selection and design.

Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), an enzyme in the eukaryotic
tryptophan catabolic pathway (that is, kynurenine pathway), leads to amelioration
of Huntington's-disease-relevant phenotypes in yeast, fruitfly and mouse models, 
as well as in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. KMO is a flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase and is located in the outer
mitochondrial membrane where it converts l-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine.
Perturbations in the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites have been linked to
the pathogenesis of a spectrum of brain disorders, as well as cancer and several 
peripheral inflammatory conditions. Despite the importance of KMO as a target for
neurodegenerative disease, the molecular basis of KMO inhibition by available
lead compounds has remained unknown. Here we report the first crystal structure
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO, in the free form and in complex with the
tight-binding inhibitor UPF 648. UPF 648 binds close to the FAD cofactor and
perturbs the local active-site structure, preventing productive binding of the
substrate l-kynurenine. Functional assays and targeted mutagenesis reveal that
the active-site architecture and UPF 648 binding are essentially identical in
human KMO, validating the yeast KMO-UPF 648 structure as a template for
structure-based drug design. This will inform the search for new KMO inhibitors
that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier in targeted therapies against
neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
diseases.

Slower recovery from perturbations near a tipping point and its indirect
signatures in fluctuation patterns have been suggested to foreshadow catastrophes
in a wide variety of systems. Recent studies of populations in the field and in
the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically
predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in
the size and timescale of fluctuations. However, the predictive power of temporal
warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale 
spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in
spatially extended systems needs to be examined empirically. Here we use
spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system with a fold
bifurcation (tipping point), to evaluate early warning signals based on
spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel spatial warning indicator.
We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before
collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitudes of the increases were 
smaller than those observed in isolated populations, possibly because local
variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator
based on deterministic spatial patterns, which we call 'recovery length'. As the 
spatial counterpart of recovery time, recovery length is the distance necessary
for connected populations to recover from spatial perturbations. In our
experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, 
suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning
signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.

Visualization of an endogenous retinoic acid gradient across embryonic
development.

In vertebrate development, the body plan is determined by primordial morphogen
gradients that suffuse the embryo. Retinoic acid (RA) is an important morphogen
involved in patterning the anterior-posterior axis of structures, including the
hindbrain and paraxial mesoderm. RA diffuses over long distances, and its
activity is spatially restricted by synthesizing and degrading enzymes. However, 
gradients of endogenous morphogens in live embryos have not been directly
observed; indeed, their existence, distribution and requirement for correct
patterning remain controversial. Here we report a family of genetically encoded
indicators for RA that we have termed GEPRAs (genetically encoded probes for RA).
Using the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer we engineered the
ligand-binding domains of RA receptors to incorporate cyan-emitting and
yellow-emitting fluorescent proteins as fluorescence resonance energy transfer
donor and acceptor, respectively, for the reliable detection of ambient free RA. 
We created three GEPRAs with different affinities for RA, enabling the
quantitative measurement of physiological RA concentrations. Live imaging of
zebrafish embryos at the gastrula and somitogenesis stages revealed a linear
concentration gradient of endogenous RA in a two-tailed source-sink arrangement
across the embryo. Modelling of the observed linear RA gradient suggests that the
rate of RA diffusion exceeds the spatiotemporal dynamics of embryogenesis,
resulting in stability to perturbation. Furthermore, we used GEPRAs in
combination with genetic and pharmacological perturbations to resolve competing
hypotheses on the structure of the RA gradient during hindbrain formation and
somitogenesis. Live imaging of endogenous concentration gradients across
embryonic development will allow the precise assignment of molecular mechanisms
to developmental dynamics and will accelerate the application of approaches based
on morphogen gradients to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Renewable fresh water over continents has input from precipitation and losses to 
the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration. Global-scale estimates of
transpiration from climate models are poorly constrained owing to large
uncertainties in stomatal conductance and the lack of catchment-scale
measurements required for model calibration, resulting in a range of predictions 
spanning 20 to 65 per cent of total terrestrial evapotranspiration (14,000 to
41,000 km(3) per year) (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Here we use the distinct isotope
effects of transpiration and evaporation to show that transpiration is by far the
largest water flux from Earth's continents, representing 80 to 90 per cent of
terrestrial evapotranspiration. On the basis of our analysis of a global data set
of large lakes and rivers, we conclude that transpiration recycles 62,000 ± 8,000
km(3) of water per year to the atmosphere, using half of all solar energy
absorbed by land surfaces in the process. We also calculate CO2 uptake by
terrestrial vegetation by connecting transpiration losses to carbon assimilation 
using water-use efficiency ratios of plants, and show the global gross primary
productivity to be 129 ± 32 gigatonnes of carbon per year, which agrees, within
the uncertainty, with previous estimates. The dominance of transpiration water
fluxes in continental evapotranspiration suggests that, from the point of view of
water resource forecasting, climate model development should prioritize
improvements in simulations of biological fluxes rather than physical
(evaporation) fluxes.

Rescuing cocaine-induced prefrontal cortex hypoactivity prevents compulsive
cocaine seeking.

Loss of control over harmful drug seeking is one of the most intractable aspects 
of addiction, as human substance abusers continue to pursue drugs despite
incurring significant negative consequences. Human studies have suggested that
deficits in prefrontal cortical function and consequential loss of inhibitory
control could be crucial in promoting compulsive drug use. However, it remains
unknown whether chronic drug use compromises cortical activity and, equally
important, whether this deficit promotes compulsive cocaine seeking. Here we use 
a rat model of compulsive drug seeking in which cocaine seeking persists in a
subgroup of rats despite delivery of noxious foot shocks. We show that prolonged 
cocaine self-administration decreases ex vivo intrinsic excitability of
deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex, which was significantly
more pronounced in compulsive drug-seeking animals. Furthermore, compensating for
hypoactive prelimbic cortex neurons with in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex
stimulation significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking, whereas
optogenetic prelimbic cortex inhibition significantly increased compulsive
cocaine seeking. Our results show a marked reduction in prelimbic cortex
excitability in compulsive cocaine-seeking rats, and that in vivo optogenetic
prelimbic cortex stimulation decreased compulsive drug-seeking behaviours. Thus, 
targeted stimulation of the prefrontal cortex could serve as a promising therapy 
for treating compulsive drug use.

    Hepatology. 2014 Jun;59(6):2416-8.

Animal viruses are broadly categorized structurally by the presence or absence of
an envelope composed of a lipid-bilayer membrane, attributes that profoundly
affect stability, transmission and immune recognition. Among those lacking an
envelope, the Picornaviridae are a large and diverse family of positive-strand
RNA viruses that includes hepatitis A virus (HAV), an ancient human pathogen that
remains a common cause of enterically transmitted hepatitis. HAV infects in a
stealth-like manner and replicates efficiently in the liver. Virus-specific
antibodies appear only after 3-4 weeks of infection, and typically herald its
resolution. Although unexplained mechanistically, both anti-HAV antibody and
inactivated whole-virus vaccines prevent disease when administered as late as 2
weeks after exposure, when virus replication is well established in the liver.
Here we show that HAV released from cells is cloaked in host-derived membranes,
thereby protecting the virion from antibody-mediated neutralization. These
enveloped viruses ('eHAV') resemble exosomes, small vesicles that are
increasingly recognized to be important in intercellular communications. They are
fully infectious, sensitive to extraction with chloroform, and circulate in the
blood of infected humans. Their biogenesis is dependent on host proteins
associated with endosomal-sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT),
namely VPS4B and ALIX. Whereas the hijacking of membranes by HAV facilitates
escape from neutralizing antibodies and probably promotes virus spread within the
liver, anti-capsid antibodies restrict replication after infection with eHAV,
suggesting a possible explanation for prophylaxis after exposure. Membrane
hijacking by HAV blurs the classic distinction between 'enveloped' and
'non-enveloped' viruses and has broad implications for mechanisms of viral egress
from infected cells as well as host immune responses.

Landscape of the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome in response to mitochondrial
depolarization.

The PARKIN ubiquitin ligase (also known as PARK2) and its regulatory kinase PINK1
(also known as PARK6), often mutated in familial early-onset Parkinson's disease,
have central roles in mitochondrial homeostasis and mitophagy. Whereas PARKIN is 
recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon depolarization via PINK1
action and can ubiquitylate porin, mitofusin and Miro proteins on the MOM, the
full repertoire of PARKIN substrates--the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome--remains 
poorly defined. Here we use quantitative diGly capture proteomics (diGly) to
elucidate the ubiquitylation site specificity and topology of PARKIN-dependent
target modification in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Hundreds of
dynamically regulated ubiquitylation sites in dozens of proteins were identified,
with strong enrichment for MOM proteins, indicating that PARKIN dramatically
alters the ubiquitylation status of the mitochondrial proteome. Using
complementary interaction proteomics, we found depolarization-dependent PARKIN
association with numerous MOM targets, autophagy receptors, and the proteasome.
Mutation of the PARKIN active site residue C431, which has been found mutated in 
Parkinson's disease patients, largely disrupts these associations. Structural and
topological analysis revealed extensive conservation of PARKIN-dependent
ubiquitylation sites on cytoplasmic domains in vertebrate and Drosophila
melanogaster MOM proteins. These studies provide a resource for understanding how
the PINK1-PARKIN pathway re-sculpts the proteome to support mitochondrial
homeostasis.

A conformational switch in HP1 releases auto-inhibition to drive heterochromatin 
assembly.

A hallmark of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-methylated heterochromatin, conserved
from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, is its ability to
spread to adjacent genomic regions. Central to heterochromatin spread is
heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which recognizes H3K9-methylated chromatin,
oligomerizes and forms a versatile platform that participates in diverse nuclear 
functions, ranging from gene silencing to chromosome segregation. How HP1
proteins assemble on methylated nucleosomal templates and how the HP1-nucleosome 
complex achieves functional versatility remain poorly understood. Here we show
that binding of the key S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, to methylated nucleosomes
drives a switch from an auto-inhibited state to a spreading-competent state. In
the auto-inhibited state, a histone-mimic sequence in one Swi6 monomer blocks
methyl-mark recognition by the chromodomain of another monomer. Auto-inhibition
is relieved by recognition of two template features, the H3K9 methyl mark and
nucleosomal DNA. Cryo-electron-microscopy-based reconstruction of the
Swi6-nucleosome complex provides the overall architecture of the
spreading-competent state in which two unbound chromodomain sticky ends appear
exposed. Disruption of the switch between the auto-inhibited and
spreading-competent states disrupts heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing
in vivo. These findings are reminiscent of other conditionally activated
polymerization processes, such as actin nucleation, and open up a new class of
regulatory mechanisms that operate on chromatin in vivo.

Type 1 pili, produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, are multisubunit fibres 
crucial in recognition of and adhesion to host tissues. During pilus biogenesis, 
subunits are recruited to an outer membrane assembly platform, the FimD usher,
which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus secretion. The recent
determination of the crystal structure of an initiation complex provided insight 
into the initiation step of pilus biogenesis resulting in pore activation, but
very little is known about the elongation steps that follow. Here, to address
this question, we determine the structure of an elongation complex in which the
tip complex assembly composed of FimC, FimF, FimG and FimH passes through FimD.
This structure demonstrates the conformational changes required to prevent
backsliding of the nascent pilus through the FimD pore and also reveals
unexpected properties of the usher pore. We show that the circular binding
interface between the pore lumen and the folded substrate participates in
transport by defining a low-energy pathway along which the nascent pilus polymer 
is guided during secretion.

Fossil dinosaur embryos are surprisingly rare, being almost entirely restricted
to Upper Cretaceous strata that record the late stages of non-avian dinosaur
evolution. Notable exceptions are the oldest known embryos from the Early
Jurassic South African sauropodomorph Massospondylus and Late Jurassic embryos of
a theropod from Portugal. The fact that dinosaur embryos are rare and typically
enclosed in eggshells limits their availability for tissue and cellular level
investigations of development. Consequently, little is known about growth
patterns in dinosaur embryos, even though post-hatching ontogeny has been studied
in several taxa. Here we report the discovery of an embryonic dinosaur bone bed
from the Lower Jurassic of China, the oldest such occurrence in the fossil
record. The embryos are similar in geological age to those of Massospondylus and 
are also assignable to a sauropodomorph dinosaur, probably Lufengosaurus. The
preservation of numerous disarticulated skeletal elements and eggshells in this
monotaxic bone bed, representing different stages of incubation and therefore
derived from different nests, provides opportunities for new investigations of
dinosaur embryology in a clade noted for gigantism. For example, comparisons
among embryonic femora of different sizes and developmental stages reveal a
consistently rapid rate of growth throughout development, possibly indicating
that short incubation times were characteristic of sauropodomorphs. In addition, 
asymmetric radial growth of the femoral shaft and rapid expansion of the fourth
trochanter suggest that embryonic muscle activation played an important role in
the pre-hatching ontogeny of these dinosaurs. This discovery also provides the
oldest evidence of in situ preservation of complex organic remains in a
terrestrial vertebrate.

Bedrock river incision drives the development of much of Earth's surface
topography, and thereby shapes the structure of mountain belts and modulates
Earth's habitability through its effects on soil erosion, nutrient fluxes and
global climate. Although it has long been expected that river incision rates
should depend strongly on precipitation rates, quantifying the effects of
precipitation rates on bedrock river incision rates has proved difficult, partly 
because river incision rates are difficult to measure and partly because
non-climatic factors can obscure climatic effects at sites where river incision
rates have been measured. Here we present measurements of river incision rates
across one of Earth's steepest rainfall gradients, which show that precipitation 
rates do indeed influence long-term bedrock river incision rates. We apply a
widely used empirical law for bedrock river incision to a series of rivers on the
Hawaiian island of Kaua'i, where mean annual precipitation ranges from 0.5 metres
to 9.5 metres (ref. 12)-over 70 per cent of the global range-and river incision
rates averaged over millions of years can be inferred from the depth of river
canyons and the age of the volcanic bedrock. Both a time-averaged analysis and
numerical modelling of transient river incision reveal that the long-term
efficiency of bedrock river incision across Kaua'i is positively correlated with 
upstream-averaged mean annual precipitation rates. We provide theoretical context
for this result by demonstrating that our measurements are consistent with a
linear dependence of river incision rates on stream power, the rate of energy
expenditure by the flow on the riverbed. These observations provide rare
empirical evidence for the long-proposed coupling between climate and river
incision, suggesting that previously proposed feedbacks among topography, climate
and tectonics may occur.

Recent temperature extremes at high northern latitudes unprecedented in the past

Recently observed extreme temperatures at high northern latitudes are rare by
definition, making the longer time span afforded by climate proxies important for
assessing how the frequency of such extremes may be changing. Previous
reconstructions of past temperature variability have demonstrated that recent
warmth is anomalous relative to preceding centuries or millennia, but extreme
events can be more thoroughly evaluated using a spatially resolved approach that 
provides an ensemble of possible temperature histories. Here, using a
hierarchical Bayesian analysis of instrumental, tree-ring, ice-core and
lake-sediment records, we show that the magnitude and frequency of recent warm
temperature extremes at high northern latitudes are unprecedented in the past 600
years. The summers of 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011 were warmer than those of all
prior years back to 1400 (probability P > 0.95), in terms of the spatial average.
The summer of 2010 was the warmest in the previous 600 years in western Russia (P
> 0.99) and probably the warmest in western Greenland and the Canadian Arctic as 
well (P > 0.90). These and other recent extremes greatly exceed those expected
from a stationary climate, but can be understood as resulting from constant
space-time variability about an increased mean temperature.

Topological insulators are a new phase of matter, with the striking property that
conduction of electrons occurs only on their surfaces. In two dimensions,
electrons on the surface of a topological insulator are not scattered despite
defects and disorder, providing robustness akin to that of superconductors.
Topological insulators are predicted to have wide-ranging applications in
fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics. Substantial effort has been
directed towards realizing topological insulators for electromagnetic waves.
One-dimensional systems with topological edge states have been demonstrated, but 
these states are zero-dimensional and therefore exhibit no transport properties. 
Topological protection of microwaves has been observed using a mechanism similar 
to the quantum Hall effect, by placing a gyromagnetic photonic crystal in an
external magnetic field. But because magnetic effects are very weak at optical
frequencies, realizing photonic topological insulators with scatter-free edge
states requires a fundamentally different mechanism-one that is free of magnetic 
fields. A number of proposals for photonic topological transport have been put
forward recently. One suggested temporal modulation of a photonic crystal, thus
breaking time-reversal symmetry and inducing one-way edge states. This is in the 
spirit of the proposed Floquet topological insulators, in which temporal
variations in solid-state systems induce topological edge states. Here we propose
and experimentally demonstrate a photonic topological insulator free of external 
fields and with scatter-free edge transport-a photonic lattice exhibiting
topologically protected transport of visible light on the lattice edges. Our
system is composed of an array of evanescently coupled helical waveguides
arranged in a graphene-like honeycomb lattice. Paraxial diffraction of light is
described by a Schrödinger equation where the propagation coordinate (z) acts as 
'time'. Thus the helicity of the waveguides breaks z-reversal symmetry as
proposed for Floquet topological insulators. This structure results in one-way
edge states that are topologically protected from scattering.

Saturn's ionosphere is produced when the otherwise neutral atmosphere is exposed 
to a flow of energetic charged particles or solar radiation. At low latitudes the
solar radiation should result in a weak planet-wide glow in the infrared,
corresponding to the planet's uniform illumination by the Sun. The observed
electron density of the low-latitude ionosphere, however, is lower and its
temperature higher than predicted by models. A planet-to-ring magnetic connection
has been previously suggested, in which an influx of water from the rings could
explain the lower-than-expected electron densities in Saturn's atmosphere. Here
we report the detection of a pattern of features, extending across a broad
latitude band from 25 to 60 degrees, that is superposed on the lower-latitude
background glow, with peaks in emission that map along the planet's magnetic
field lines to gaps in Saturn's rings. This pattern implies the transfer of
charged species derived from water from the ring-plane to the ionosphere, an
influx on a global scale, flooding between 30 to 43 per cent of the surface of
Saturn's upper atmosphere. This ring 'rain' is important in modulating
ionospheric emissions and suppressing electron densities.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their subsequent progenitors produce blood
cells, but the precise nature and kinetics of this production is a contentious
issue. In one model, lymphoid and myeloid production branch after the
lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP), with both branches subsequently
producing dendritic cells. However, this model is based mainly on in vitro clonal
assays and population-based tracking in vivo, which could miss in vivo
single-cell complexity. Here we avoid these issues by using a new quantitative
version of 'cellular barcoding' to trace the in vivo fate of hundreds of LMPPs
and HSCs at the single-cell level. These data demonstrate that LMPPs are highly
heterogeneous in the cell types that they produce, separating into combinations
of lymphoid-, myeloid- and dendritic-cell-biased producers. Conversely, although 
we observe a known lineage bias of some HSCs, most cellular output is derived
from a small number of HSCs that each generates all cell types. Crucially, in
vivo analysis of the output of sibling cells derived from single LMPPs shows that
they often share a similar fate, suggesting that the fate of these progenitors
was imprinted. Furthermore, as this imprinting is also observed for
dendritic-cell-biased LMPPs, dendritic cells may be considered a distinct lineage
on the basis of separate ancestry. These data suggest a 'graded commitment' model
of haematopoiesis, in which heritable and diverse lineage imprinting occurs
earlier than previously thought.

Telomerase adds telomeric repeats to chromosome ends using an internal RNA
template and a specialized telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), thereby
maintaining genome integrity. Little is known about the physical relationships
among protein and RNA subunits within a biologically functional holoenzyme. Here 
we describe the architecture of Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase holoenzyme
determined by electron microscopy. Six of the seven proteins and the TERT-binding
regions of telomerase RNA (TER) have been localized by affinity labelling.
Fitting with high-resolution structures reveals the organization of TERT, TER and
p65 in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) catalytic core. p50 has an unanticipated role 
as a hub between the RNP catalytic core, p75-p19-p45 subcomplex, and the
DNA-binding Teb1. A complete in vitro holoenzyme reconstitution assigns function 
to these interactions in processive telomeric repeat synthesis. These studies
provide the first view of the extensive network of subunit associations necessary
for telomerase holoenzyme assembly and physiological function.

Our innate immune system distinguishes microbes from self by detecting conserved 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, these are produced by all
microbes, regardless of their pathogenic potential. To distinguish virulent
microbes from those with lower disease-causing potential the innate immune system
detects conserved pathogen-induced processes, such as the presence of microbial
products in the host cytosol, by mechanisms that are not fully resolved. Here we 
show that NOD1 senses cytosolic microbial products by monitoring the activation
state of small Rho GTPases. Activation of RAC1 and CDC42 by bacterial delivery or
ectopic expression of SopE, a virulence factor of the enteric pathogen
Salmonella, triggered the NOD1 signalling pathway, with consequent RIP2 (also
known as RIPK2)-mediated induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses.
Similarly, activation of the NOD1 signalling pathway by peptidoglycan required
RAC1 activity. Furthermore, constitutively active forms of RAC1, CDC42 and RHOA
activated the NOD1 signalling pathway. Our data identify the activation of small 
Rho GTPases as a pathogen-induced process sensed through the NOD1 signalling
pathway.

Meristems encompass stem/progenitor cells that sustain postembryonic growth of
all plant organs. How meristems are activated and sustained by nutrient
signalling remains enigmatic in photosynthetic plants. Combining chemical
manipulations and chemical genetics at the photoautotrophic transition
checkpoint, we reveal that shoot photosynthesis-derived glucose drives
target-of-rapamycin (TOR) signalling relays through glycolysis and mitochondrial 
bioenergetics to control root meristem activation, which is decoupled from direct
glucose sensing, growth-hormone signalling and stem-cell maintenance.
Surprisingly, glucose-TOR signalling dictates transcriptional reprogramming of
remarkable gene sets involved in central and secondary metabolism, cell cycle,
transcription, signalling, transport and protein folding. Systems, cellular and
genetic analyses uncover TOR phosphorylation of E2Fa transcription factor for an 
unconventional activation of S-phase genes, and glucose-signalling defects in
e2fa root meristems. Our findings establish pivotal roles of glucose-TOR
signalling in unprecedented transcriptional networks wiring central metabolism
and biosynthesis for energy and biomass production, and integrating localized
stem/progenitor-cell proliferation through inter-organ nutrient coordination to
control developmental transition and growth.

Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family transporters are conserved
in the three primary domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya), and export 
xenobiotics using an electrochemical gradient of H(+) or Na(+) across the
membrane. MATE transporters confer multidrug resistance to bacterial pathogens
and cancer cells, thus causing critical reductions in the therapeutic efficacies 
of antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, respectively. Therefore, the development of
MATE inhibitors has long been awaited in the field of clinical medicine. Here we 
present the crystal structures of the H(+)-driven MATE transporter from
Pyrococcus furiosus in two distinct apo-form conformations, and in complexes with
a derivative of the antibacterial drug norfloxacin and three in vitro selected
thioether-macrocyclic peptides, at 2.1-3.0 Å resolutions. The structures,
combined with functional analyses, show that the protonation of Asp 41 on the
amino (N)-terminal lobe induces the bending of TM1, which in turn collapses the
N-lobe cavity, thereby extruding the substrate drug to the extracellular space.
Moreover, the macrocyclic peptides bind the central cleft in distinct manners,
which correlate with their inhibitory activities. The strongest inhibitory
peptide that occupies the N-lobe cavity may pave the way towards the development 
of efficient inhibitors against MATE transporters.

Half of the microbial cells in the Earth's oceans are found in sediments. Many of
these cells are members of the Archaea, single-celled prokaryotes in a domain of 
life separate from Bacteria and Eukaryota. However, most of these archaea lack
cultured representatives, leaving their physiologies and placement on the tree of
life uncertain. Here we show that the uncultured miscellaneous crenarchaeotal
group (MCG) and marine benthic group-D (MBG-D) are among the most numerous
archaea in the marine sub-sea floor. Single-cell genomic sequencing of one cell
of MCG and three cells of MBG-D indicated that they form new branches basal to
the archaeal phyla Thaumarchaeota and Aigarchaeota, for MCG, and the order
Thermoplasmatales, for MBG-D. All four cells encoded extracellular
protein-degrading enzymes such as gingipain and clostripain that are known to be 
effective in environments chemically similar to marine sediments. Furthermore, we
found these two types of peptidase to be abundant and active in marine sediments,
indicating that uncultured archaea may have a previously undiscovered role in
protein remineralization in anoxic marine sediments.

Macrophages activated by the Gram-negative bacterial product lipopolysaccharide
switch their core metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Here
we show that inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose suppresses
lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1β but not tumour-necrosis factor-α in
mouse macrophages. A comprehensive metabolic map of lipopolysaccharide-activated 
macrophages shows upregulation of glycolytic and downregulation of mitochondrial 
genes, which correlates directly with the expression profiles of altered
metabolites. Lipopolysaccharide strongly increases the levels of the
tricarboxylic-acid cycle intermediate succinate. Glutamine-dependent anerplerosis
is the principal source of succinate, although the 'GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)
shunt' pathway also has a role. Lipopolysaccharide-induced succinate stabilizes
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, an effect that is inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose, with 
interleukin-1β as an important target. Lipopolysaccharide also increases
succinylation of several proteins. We therefore identify succinate as a
metabolite in innate immune signalling, which enhances interleukin-1β production 
during inflammation.

Behavioural states in mammals, such as the anxious state, are characterized by
several features that are coordinately regulated by diverse nervous system
outputs, ranging from behavioural choice patterns to changes in physiology (in
anxiety, exemplified respectively by risk-avoidance and respiratory rate
alterations). Here we investigate if and how defined neural projections arising
from a single coordinating brain region in mice could mediate diverse features of
anxiety. Integrating behavioural assays, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, 
respiratory physiology and optogenetics, we identify a surprising new role for
the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the coordinated modulation of
diverse anxiety features. First, two BNST subregions were unexpectedly found to
exert opposite effects on the anxious state: oval BNST activity promoted several 
independent anxious state features, whereas anterodorsal BNST-associated activity
exerted anxiolytic influence for the same features. Notably, we found that three 
distinct anterodorsal BNST efferent projections-to the lateral hypothalamus,
parabrachial nucleus and ventral tegmental area-each implemented an independent
feature of anxiolysis: reduced risk-avoidance, reduced respiratory rate, and
increased positive valence, respectively. Furthermore, selective inhibition of
corresponding circuit elements in freely moving mice showed opposing behavioural 
effects compared with excitation, and in vivo recordings during free behaviour
showed native spiking patterns in anterodorsal BNST neurons that differentiated
safe and anxiogenic environments. These results demonstrate that distinct BNST
subregions exert opposite effects in modulating anxiety, establish separable
anxiolytic roles for different anterodorsal BNST projections, and illustrate
circuit mechanisms underlying selection of features for the assembly of the
anxious state.

The co-morbidity of anxiety and dysfunctional reward processing in illnesses such
as addiction and depression suggests that common neural circuitry contributes to 
these disparate neuropsychiatric symptoms. The extended amygdala, including the
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), modulates fear and anxiety, but also 
projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region implicated in reward and
aversion, thus providing a candidate neural substrate for integrating diverse
emotional states. However, the precise functional connectivity between distinct
BNST projection neurons and their postsynaptic targets in the VTA, as well as the
role of this circuit in controlling motivational states, have not been described.
Here we record and manipulate the activity of genetically and neurochemically
identified VTA-projecting BNST neurons in freely behaving mice. Collectively,
aversive stimuli exposure produced heterogeneous firing patterns in
VTA-projecting BNST neurons. By contrast, in vivo optically identified
glutamatergic projection neurons displayed a net enhancement of activity to
aversive stimuli, whereas the firing rate of identified GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric
acid-containing) projection neurons was suppressed. Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted
circuit mapping revealed that both BNST glutamatergic and GABAergic projections
preferentially innervate postsynaptic non-dopaminergic VTA neurons, thus
providing a mechanistic framework for in vivo circuit perturbations. In vivo
photostimulation of BNST glutamatergic projections resulted in aversive and
anxiogenic behavioural phenotypes. Conversely, activation of BNST GABAergic
projections produced rewarding and anxiolytic phenotypes, which were also
recapitulated by direct inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons. These data
demonstrate that functionally opposing BNST to VTA circuits regulate rewarding
and aversive motivational states, and may serve as a crucial circuit node for
bidirectionally normalizing maladaptive behaviours.

(S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonate ((S)-2-HPP) epoxidase (HppE) is a mononuclear
non-haem-iron-dependent enzyme responsible for the final step in the biosynthesis
of the clinically useful antibiotic fosfomycin. Enzymes of this class typically
catalyse oxygenation reactions that proceed via the formation of substrate
radical intermediates. By contrast, HppE catalyses an unusual dehydrogenation
reaction while converting the secondary alcohol of (S)-2-HPP to the epoxide ring 
of fosfomycin. Here we show that HppE also catalyses a biologically unprecedented
1,2-phosphono migration with the alternative substrate (R)-1-HPP. This
transformation probably involves an intermediary carbocation, based on
observations with additional substrate analogues, such as
(1R)-1-hydroxyl-2-aminopropylphosphonate, and model reactions for both radical-
and carbocation-mediated migration. The ability of HppE to catalyse distinct
reactions depending on the regio- and stereochemical properties of the substrate 
is given a structural basis using X-ray crystallography. These results provide
compelling evidence for the formation of a substrate-derived cation intermediate 
in the catalytic cycle of a mononuclear non-haem-iron-dependent enzyme. The
underlying chemistry of this unusual phosphono migration may represent a new
paradigm for the in vivo construction of phosphonate-containing natural products 
that can be exploited for the preparation of new phosphonate derivatives.

The Sir2 family of enzymes or sirtuins are known as nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylases and have been implicated in the
regulation of transcription, genome stability, metabolism and lifespan. However, 
four of the seven mammalian sirtuins have very weak deacetylase activity in
vitro. Here we show that human SIRT6 efficiently removes long-chain fatty acyl
groups, such as myristoyl, from lysine residues. The crystal structure of SIRT6
reveals a large hydrophobic pocket that can accommodate long-chain fatty acyl
groups. We demonstrate further that SIRT6 promotes the secretion of tumour
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by removing the fatty acyl modification on K19 and K20 
of TNF-α. Protein lysine fatty acylation has been known to occur in mammalian
cells, but the function and regulatory mechanisms of this modification were
unknown. Our data indicate that protein lysine fatty acylation is a novel
mechanism that regulates protein secretion. The discovery of SIRT6 as an enzyme
that controls protein lysine fatty acylation provides new opportunities to
investigate the physiological function of a protein post-translational
modification that has been little studied until now.

Sensory processing occurs in neocortical microcircuits in which synaptic
connectivity is highly structured and excitatory neurons form subnetworks that
process related sensory information. However, the developmental mechanisms
underlying the formation of functionally organized connectivity in cortical
microcircuits remain unknown. Here we directly relate patterns of excitatory
synaptic connectivity to visual response properties of neighbouring layer 2/3
pyramidal neurons in mouse visual cortex at different postnatal ages, using
two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and multiple whole-cell recordings in vitro.
Although neural responses were already highly selective for visual stimuli at eye
opening, neurons responding to similar visual features were not yet
preferentially connected, indicating that the emergence of feature selectivity
does not depend on the precise arrangement of local synaptic connections. After
eye opening, local connectivity reorganized extensively: more connections formed 
selectively between neurons with similar visual responses and connections were
eliminated between visually unresponsive neurons, but the overall connectivity
rate did not change. We propose a sequential model of cortical microcircuit
development based on activity-dependent mechanisms of plasticity whereby neurons 
first acquire feature preference by selecting feedforward inputs before the onset
of sensory experience--a process that may be facilitated by early electrical
coupling between neuronal subsets--and then patterned input drives the formation 
of functional subnetworks through a redistribution of recurrent synaptic
connections.

Melting of the world's major ice sheets can affect human and environmental
conditions by contributing to sea-level rise. In July 2012, an historically rare 
period of extended surface melting was observed across almost the entire
Greenland ice sheet, raising questions about the frequency and spatial extent of 
such events. Here we show that low-level clouds consisting of liquid water
droplets ('liquid clouds'), via their radiative effects, played a key part in
this melt event by increasing near-surface temperatures. We used a suite of
surface-based observations, remote sensing data, and a surface energy-balance
model. At the critical surface melt time, the clouds were optically thick enough 
and low enough to enhance the downwelling infrared flux at the surface. At the
same time they were optically thin enough to allow sufficient solar radiation to 
penetrate through them and raise surface temperatures above the melting point.
Outside this narrow range in cloud optical thickness, the radiative contribution 
to the surface energy budget would have been diminished, and the spatial extent
of this melting event would have been smaller. We further show that these thin,
low-level liquid clouds occur frequently, both over Greenland and across the
Arctic, being present around 30-50 per cent of the time. Our results may help to 
explain the difficulties that global climate models have in simulating the Arctic
surface energy budget, particularly as models tend to under-predict the formation
of optically thin liquid clouds at supercooled temperatures--a process
potentially necessary to account fully for temperature feedbacks in a warming
Arctic climate.

The incorporation of impurities during the growth of nanowires from the vapour
phase alters their basic properties substantially, and this process is critical
in an extended range of emerging nanometre-scale technologies. In particular,
achieving precise control of the behaviour of group III and group V dopants has
been a crucial step in the development of silicon (Si) nanowire-based devices.
Recently it has been demonstrated that the use of aluminium (Al) as a growth
catalyst, instead of the usual gold, also yields an effective p-type doping,
thereby enabling a novel and efficient route to functionalizing Si nanowires.
Besides the technological implications, this self-doping implies the detachment
of Al from the catalyst and its injection into the growing nanowire, involving
atomic-scale processes that are crucial for the fundamental understanding of the 
catalytic assembly of nanowires. Here we present an atomic-level, quantitative
study of this phenomenon of catalyst dissolution by three-dimensional
atom-by-atom mapping of individual Al-catalysed Si nanowires using highly focused
ultraviolet-laser-assisted atom-probe tomography. Although the observed
incorporation of the catalyst atoms into nanowires exceeds by orders of magnitude
the equilibrium solid solubility and solid-solution concentrations in known
non-equilibrium processes, the Al impurities are found to be homogeneously
distributed in the nanowire and do not form precipitates or clusters. As well as 
the anticipated effect on the electrical properties, this kinetics-driven
colossal injection also has direct implications for nanowire morphology. We
discuss the observed strong deviation from equilibrium using a model of solute
trapping at step edges, and identify the key growth parameters behind this
phenomenon on the basis of a kinetic model of step-flow growth of nanowires. The 
control of this phenomenon provides opportunities to create a new class of
nanoscale devices by precisely tailoring the shape and composition of
metal-catalysed nanowires.

Femtosecond switching of magnetism via strongly correlated spin-charge quantum
excitations.

The technological demand to push the gigahertz (10(9) hertz) switching speed
limit of today's magnetic memory and logic devices into the terahertz
(10(12) hertz) regime underlies the entire field of spin-electronics and
integrated multi-functional devices. This challenge is met by all-optical
magnetic switching based on coherent spin manipulation. By analogy to femtosecond
chemistry and photosynthetic dynamics--in which photoproducts of chemical and
biochemical reactions can be influenced by creating suitable superpositions of
molecular states--femtosecond-laser-excited coherence between electronic states
can switch magnetic order by 'suddenly' breaking the delicate balance between
competing phases of correlated materials: for example, manganites exhibiting
colossal magneto-resistance suitable for applications. Here we show femtosecond
(10(-15) seconds) photo-induced switching from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
ordering in Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3, by observing the establishment (within about
120 femtoseconds) of a huge temperature-dependent magnetization with
photo-excitation threshold behaviour absent in the optical reflectivity. The
development of ferromagnetic correlations during the femtosecond laser pulse
reveals an initial quantum coherent regime of magnetism, distinguished from the
picosecond (10(-12) seconds) lattice-heating regime characterized by phase
separation without threshold behaviour. Our simulations reproduce the nonlinear
femtosecond spin generation and underpin fast quantum spin-flip fluctuations
correlated with coherent superpositions of electronic states to initiate local
ferromagnetic correlations. These results merge two fields, femtosecond magnetism
in metals and band insulators, and non-equilibrium phase transitions of strongly 
correlated electrons, in which local interactions exceeding the kinetic energy
produce a complex balance of competing orders.

The western quarter of North America consists of accreted terranes--crustal
blocks added over the past 200 million years--but the reason for this is unclear.
The widely accepted explanation posits that the oceanic Farallon plate acted as a
conveyor belt, sweeping terranes into the continental margin while subducting
under it. Here we show that this hypothesis, which fails to explain many terrane 
complexities, is also inconsistent with new tomographic images of lower-mantle
slabs, and with their locations relative to plate reconstructions. We offer a
reinterpretation of North American palaeogeography and test it quantitatively:
collision events are clearly recorded by slab geometry, and can be time
calibrated and reconciled with plate reconstructions and surface geology. The
seas west of Cretaceous North America must have resembled today's western
Pacific, strung with island arcs. All proto-Pacific plates initially subducted
into almost stationary, intra-oceanic trenches, and accumulated below as massive 
vertical slab walls. Above the slabs, long-lived volcanic archipelagos and
subduction complexes grew. Crustal accretion occurred when North America overrode
the archipelagos, causing major episodes of Cordilleran mountain building.

About five to four million years ago, in the early Pliocene epoch, Earth had a
warm, temperate climate. The gradual cooling that followed led to the
establishment of modern temperature patterns, possibly in response to a decrease 
in atmospheric CO2 concentration, of the order of 100 parts per million, towards 
preindustrial values. Here we synthesize the available geochemical proxy records 
of sea surface temperature and show that, compared with that of today, the early 
Pliocene climate had substantially lower meridional and zonal temperature
gradients but similar maximum ocean temperatures. Using an Earth system model, we
show that none of the mechanisms currently proposed to explain Pliocene warmth
can simultaneously reproduce all three crucial features. We suggest that a
combination of several dynamical feedbacks underestimated in the models at
present, such as those related to ocean mixing and cloud albedo, may have been
responsible for these climate conditions.

Cancer cells have metabolic dependencies that distinguish them from their normal 
counterparts. Among these dependencies is an increased use of the amino acid
glutamine to fuel anabolic processes. Indeed, the spectrum of glutamine-dependent
tumours and the mechanisms whereby glutamine supports cancer metabolism remain
areas of active investigation. Here we report the identification of a
non-canonical pathway of glutamine use in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC) cells that is required for tumour growth. Whereas most cells use glutamate
dehydrogenase (GLUD1) to convert glutamine-derived glutamate into α-ketoglutarate
in the mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle, PDAC relies on a
distinct pathway in which glutamine-derived aspartate is transported into the
cytoplasm where it can be converted into oxaloacetate by aspartate transaminase
(GOT1). Subsequently, this oxaloacetate is converted into malate and then
pyruvate, ostensibly increasing the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio which can potentially
maintain the cellular redox state. Importantly, PDAC cells are strongly dependent
on this series of reactions, as glutamine deprivation or genetic inhibition of
any enzyme in this pathway leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species and a 
reduction in reduced glutathione. Moreover, knockdown of any component enzyme in 
this series of reactions also results in a pronounced suppression of PDAC growth 
in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we establish that the reprogramming of
glutamine metabolism is mediated by oncogenic KRAS, the signature genetic
alteration in PDAC, through the transcriptional upregulation and repression of
key metabolic enzymes in this pathway. The essentiality of this pathway in PDAC
and the fact that it is dispensable in normal cells may provide novel therapeutic
approaches to treat these refractory tumours.

A solution to release twisted DNA during chromosome replication by coupled DNA
polymerases.

Chromosomal replication machines contain coupled DNA polymerases that
simultaneously replicate the leading and lagging strands. However, coupled
replication presents a largely unrecognized topological problem. Because DNA
polymerase must travel a helical path during synthesis, the physical connection
between leading- and lagging-strand polymerases causes the daughter strands to
entwine, or produces extensive build-up of negative supercoils in the newly
synthesized DNA. How DNA polymerases maintain their connection during coupled
replication despite these topological challenges is unknown. Here we examine the 
dynamics of the Escherichia coli replisome, using ensemble and single-molecule
methods, and show that the replisome may solve the topological problem
independent of topoisomerases. We find that the lagging-strand polymerase
frequently releases from an Okazaki fragment before completion, leaving
single-strand gaps behind. Dissociation of the polymerase does not result in loss
from the replisome because of its contact with the leading-strand polymerase.
This behaviour, referred to as 'signal release', had been thought to require a
protein, possibly primase, to pry polymerase from incompletely extended DNA
fragments. However, we observe that signal release is independent of primase and 
does not seem to require a protein trigger at all. Instead, the lagging-strand
polymerase is simply less processive in the context of a replisome.
Interestingly, when the lagging-strand polymerase is supplied with primed DNA in 
trans, uncoupling it from the fork, high processivity is restored. Hence, we
propose that coupled polymerases introduce topological changes, possibly by
accumulation of superhelical tension in the newly synthesized DNA, that cause
lower processivity and transient lagging-strand polymerase dissociation from DNA.

Protein N-myristoylation is a 14-carbon fatty-acid modification that is conserved
across eukaryotic species and occurs on nearly 1% of the cellular proteome. The
ability of the myristoyl group to facilitate dynamic protein-protein and
protein-membrane interactions (known as the myristoyl switch) makes it an
essential feature of many signal transduction systems. Thus pathogenic strategies
that facilitate protein demyristoylation would markedly alter the signalling
landscape of infected host cells. Here we describe an irreversible mechanism of
protein demyristoylation catalysed by invasion plasmid antigen J (IpaJ), a
previously uncharacterized Shigella flexneri type III effector protein with
cysteine protease activity. A yeast genetic screen for IpaJ substrates identified
ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1p and ARF2p, small molecular mass GTPases that
regulate cargo transport through the Golgi apparatus. Mass spectrometry showed
that IpaJ cleaved the peptide bond between N-myristoylated glycine-2 and
asparagine-3 of human ARF1, thereby providing a new mechanism for host secretory 
inhibition by a bacterial pathogen. We further demonstrate that IpaJ cleaves an
array of N-myristoylated proteins involved in cellular growth, signal
transduction, autophagasome maturation and organelle function. Taken together,
these findings show a previously unrecognized pathogenic mechanism for the
site-specific elimination of N-myristoyl protein modification.

Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is one of the most widely cultivated and 
consumed food crops in the world. However, the complex polyploid nature of its
genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome,
as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T.
turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGA(m)A(m)), is
central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement. The progenitor
species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu, which
resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the
ancestor of the B genome) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome),
especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present
the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of
the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome 
structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important
genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly
provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a
valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat.

Dislocations and their interactions strongly influence many material properties, 
ranging from the strength of metals and alloys to the efficiency of
light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. Several experimental methods can be used 
to visualize dislocations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has long been
used to image dislocations in materials, and high-resolution electron microscopy 
can reveal dislocation core structures in high detail, particularly in annular
dark-field mode. A TEM image, however, represents a two-dimensional projection of
a three-dimensional (3D) object (although stereo TEM provides limited information
about 3D dislocations). X-ray topography can image dislocations in three
dimensions, but with reduced resolution. Using weak-beam dark-field TEM and
scanning TEM, electron tomography has been used to image 3D dislocations at a
resolution of about five nanometres (refs 15, 16). Atom probe tomography can
offer higher-resolution 3D characterization of dislocations, but requires
needle-shaped samples and can detect only about 60 per cent of the atoms in a
sample. Here we report 3D imaging of dislocations in materials at atomic
resolution by electron tomography. By applying 3D Fourier filtering together with
equal-slope tomographic reconstruction, we observe nearly all the atoms in a
multiply twinned platinum nanoparticle. We observed atomic steps at 3D twin
boundaries and imaged the 3D core structure of edge and screw dislocations at
atomic resolution. These dislocations and the atomic steps at the twin
boundaries, which appear to be stress-relief mechanisms, are not visible in
conventional two-dimensional projections. The ability to image 3D disordered
structures such as dislocations at atomic resolution is expected to find
applications in materials science, nanoscience, solid-state physics and
chemistry.

About 8,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, a spontaneous hybridization of the
wild diploid grass Aegilops tauschii (2n = 14; DD) with the cultivated tetraploid
wheat Triticum turgidum (2n = 4x = 28; AABB) resulted in hexaploid wheat (T.
aestivum; 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD). Wheat has since become a primary staple crop
worldwide as a result of its enhanced adaptability to a wide range of climates
and improved grain quality for the production of baker's flour. Here we describe 
sequencing the Ae. tauschii genome and obtaining a roughly 90-fold depth of short
reads from libraries with various insert sizes, to gain a better understanding of
this genetically complex plant. The assembled scaffolds represented 83.4% of the 
genome, of which 65.9% comprised transposable elements. We generated
comprehensive RNA-Seq data and used it to identify 43,150 protein-coding genes,
of which 30,697 (71.1%) were uniquely anchored to chromosomes with an integrated 
high-density genetic map. Whole-genome analysis revealed gene family expansion in
Ae. tauschii of agronomically relevant gene families that were associated with
disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and grain quality. This draft genome
sequence provides insight into the environmental adaptation of bread wheat and
can aid in defining the large and complicated genomes of wheat species.

Electron transfer reactions are essential for life because they underpin
oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis, processes leading to the generation
of ATP, and are involved in many reactions of intermediary metabolism. Key to
these roles is the formation of transient inter-protein electron transfer
complexes. The structural basis for the control of specificity between partner
proteins is lacking because these weak transient complexes have remained largely 
intractable for crystallographic studies. Inter-protein electron transfer
processes are central to all of the key steps of denitrification, an alternative 
form of respiration in which bacteria reduce nitrate or nitrite to N2 through the
gaseous intermediates nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) when oxygen
concentrations are limiting. The one-electron reduction of nitrite to NO, a
precursor to N2O, is performed by either a haem- or copper-containing nitrite
reductase (CuNiR) where they receive an electron from redox partner proteins a
cupredoxin or a c-type cytochrome. Here we report the structures of the newly
characterized three-domain haem-c-Cu nitrite reductase from Ralstonia pickettii
(RpNiR) at 1.01 Å resolution and its M92A and P93A mutants. Very high resolution 
provides the first view of the atomic detail of the interface between the core
trimeric cupredoxin structure of CuNiR and the tethered cytochrome c domain that 
allows the enzyme to function as an effective self-electron transfer system where
the donor and acceptor proteins are fused together by genomic acquisition for
functional advantage. Comparison of RpNiR with the binary complex of a CuNiR with
a donor protein, AxNiR-cytc551 (ref. 6), and mutagenesis studies provide direct
evidence for the importance of a hydrogen-bonded water at the interface in
electron transfer. The structure also provides an explanation for the
preferential binding of nitrite to the reduced copper ion at the active site in
RpNiR, in contrast to other CuNiRs where reductive inactivation occurs,
preventing substrate binding.

The cryptochrome (CRY) flavoproteins act as blue-light receptors in plants and
insects, but perform light-independent functions at the core of the mammalian
circadian clock. To drive clock oscillations, mammalian CRYs associate with the
Period proteins (PERs) and together inhibit the transcription of their own genes.
The SCF(FBXL3) ubiquitin ligase complex controls this negative feedback loop by
promoting CRY ubiquitination and degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms
of their interactions and the functional role of flavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD) binding in CRYs remain poorly understood. Here we report crystal structures
of mammalian CRY2 in its apo, FAD-bound and FBXL3-SKP1-complexed forms. Distinct 
from other cryptochromes of known structures, mammalian CRY2 binds FAD
dynamically with an open cofactor pocket. Notably, the F-box protein FBXL3
captures CRY2 by simultaneously occupying its FAD-binding pocket with a conserved
carboxy-terminal tail and burying its PER-binding interface. This novel
F-box-protein-substrate bipartite interaction is susceptible to disruption by
both FAD and PERs, suggesting a new avenue for pharmacological targeting of the
complex and a multifaceted regulatory mechanism of CRY ubiquitination.

Tapeworms (Cestoda) cause neglected diseases that can be fatal and are difficult 
to treat, owing to inefficient drugs. Here we present an analysis of tapeworm
genome sequences using the human-infective species Echinococcus multilocularis,
E. granulosus, Taenia solium and the laboratory model Hymenolepis microstoma as
examples. The 115- to 141-megabase genomes offer insights into the evolution of
parasitism. Synteny is maintained with distantly related blood flukes but we find
extreme losses of genes and pathways that are ubiquitous in other animals,
including 34 homeobox families and several determinants of stem cell fate.
Tapeworms have specialized detoxification pathways, metabolism that is finely
tuned to rely on nutrients scavenged from their hosts, and species-specific
expansions of non-canonical heat shock proteins and families of known antigens.
We identify new potential drug targets, including some on which existing
pharmaceuticals may act. The genomes provide a rich resource to underpin the
development of urgently needed treatments and control.

Several mechanisms that increase the rate of mutagenesis across the entire genome
have been identified; however, how the rate of evolution might be promoted in
individual genes is unclear. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading
strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on
collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when 
genes are encoded on the lagging strand. Here we identify the ubiquitous (core)
genes in Bacillus subtilis and determine that 17% of them are on the lagging
strand. We find a higher rate of point mutations in the core genes on the lagging
strand compared with those on the leading strand, with this difference being
primarily in the amino-acid-changing (nonsynonymous) mutations. We determine
that, overall, the genes under strong negative selection against
amino-acid-changing mutations tend to be on the leading strand, co-oriented with 
replication. In contrast, on the basis of the rate of convergent mutations, genes
under positive selection for amino-acid-changing mutations are more commonly
found on the lagging strand, indicating faster adaptive evolution in many genes
in the head-on orientation. Increased gene length and gene expression amounts are
positively correlated with the rate of accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in
the head-on genes, suggesting that the conflict between replication and
transcription could be a driving force behind these mutations. Indeed, using
reversion assays, we show that the difference in the rate of mutagenesis of genes
in the two orientations is transcription dependent. Altogether, our findings
indicate that head-on replication-transcription conflicts are more mutagenic than
co-directional conflicts and that these encounters can significantly increase
adaptive structural variation in the coded proteins. We propose that bacteria,
and potentially other organisms, promote faster evolution of specific genes
through orientation-dependent encounters between DNA replication and
transcription.

Electrical image of passive mantle upwelling beneath the northern East Pacific
Rise.

Melt generated by mantle upwelling is fundamental to the production of new
oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges, yet the forces controlling this process are
debated. Passive-flow models predict symmetric upwelling due to viscous drag from
the diverging tectonic plates, but have been challenged by geophysical
observations of asymmetric upwelling that suggest anomalous mantle pressure and
temperature gradients, and by observations of concentrated upwelling centres
consistent with active models where buoyancy forces give rise to focused
convective flow. Here we use sea-floor magnetotelluric soundings at the
fast-spreading northern East Pacific Rise to image mantle electrical structure to
a depth of about 160 kilometres. Our data reveal a symmetric, high-conductivity
region at depths of 20-90 kilometres that is consistent with partial melting of
passively upwelling mantle. The triangular region of conductive partial melt
matches passive-flow predictions, suggesting that melt focusing to the ridge
occurs in the porous melting region rather than along the shallower base of the
thermal lithosphere. A deeper conductor observed east of the ridge at a depth of 
more than 100 kilometres is explained by asymmetric upwelling due to viscous
coupling across two nearby transform faults. Significant electrical anisotropy
occurs only in the shallowest mantle east of the ridge axis, where high vertical 
conductivity at depths of 10-20 kilometres indicates localized porous conduits.
This suggests that a coincident seismic-velocity anomaly is evidence of shallow
magma transport channels rather than deeper off-axis upwelling. We interpret the 
mantle electrical structure as evidence that plate-driven passive upwelling
dominates this ridge segment, with dynamic forces being negligible.

Growing evidence suggests that the low atmospheric CO2 concentration of the ice
ages resulted from enhanced storage of CO2 in the ocean interior, largely as a
result of changes in the Southern Ocean. Early in the most recent deglaciation, a
reduction in North Atlantic overturning circulation seems to have driven CO2
release from the Southern Ocean, but the mechanism connecting the North Atlantic 
and the Southern Ocean remains unclear. Biogenic opal export in the low-latitude 
ocean relies on silicate from the underlying thermocline, the concentration of
which is affected by the circulation of the ocean interior. Here we report a
record of biogenic opal export from a coastal upwelling system off the coast of
northwest Africa that shows pronounced opal maxima during each glacial
termination over the past 550,000 years. These opal peaks are consistent with a
strong deglacial reduction in the formation of silicate-poor glacial North
Atlantic intermediate water (GNAIW). The loss of GNAIW allowed mixing with
underlying silicate-rich deep water to increase the silicate supply to the
surface ocean. An increase in westerly-wind-driven upwelling in the Southern
Ocean in response to the North Atlantic change has been proposed to drive the
deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 (refs 3, 4). However, such a circulation change
would have accelerated the formation of Antarctic intermediate water and
sub-Antarctic mode water, which today have as little silicate as North Atlantic
Deep Water and would have thus maintained low silicate concentrations in the
Atlantic thermocline. The deglacial opal maxima reported here suggest an
alternative mechanism for the deglacial CO2 release. Just as the reduction in
GNAIW led to upward silicate transport, it should also have allowed the downward 
mixing of warm, low-density surface water to reach into the deep ocean. The
resulting decrease in the density of the deep Atlantic relative to the Southern
Ocean surface promoted Antarctic overturning, which released CO2 to the
atmosphere.

Compared with atoms, molecules have a rich internal structure that offers many
opportunities for technological and scientific advancement. The study of this
structure could yield critical insights into quantum chemistry, new methods for
manipulating quantum information, and improved tests of discrete symmetry
violation and fundamental constant variation. Harnessing this potential typically
requires the preparation of cold molecules in their quantum rovibrational ground 
state. However, the molecular internal structure severely complicates efforts to 
produce such samples. Removal of energy stored in long-lived vibrational levels
is particularly problematic because optical transitions between vibrational
levels are not governed by strict selection rules, which makes laser cooling
difficult. Additionally, traditional collisional, or sympathetic, cooling methods
are inefficient at quenching molecular vibrational motion. Here we experimentally
demonstrate that the vibrational motion of trapped BaCl(+) molecules is quenched 
by collisions with ultracold calcium atoms at a rate comparable to the classical 
scattering, or Langevin, rate. This is over four orders of magnitude more
efficient than traditional sympathetic cooling schemes. The high cooling rate, a 
consequence of a strong interaction potential (due to the high polarizability of 
calcium), along with the low collision energies involved, leads to molecular
samples with a vibrational ground-state occupancy of at least 90 per cent. Our
demonstration uses a novel thermometry technique that relies on relative
photodissociation yields. Although the decrease in vibrational temperature is
modest, with straightforward improvements it should be possible to produce
molecular samples with a vibrational ground-state occupancy greater than 99 per
cent in less than 100 milliseconds. Because sympathetic cooling of molecular
rotational motion is much more efficient than vibrational cooling in traditional 
systems, we expect that the method also allows efficient cooling of the
rotational motion of the molecules. Moreover, the technique should work for many 
different combinations of ultracold atoms and molecules.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is the primary tracer for interstellar clouds where stars
form, but it has never been detected in galaxies in which the oxygen abundance
relative to hydrogen is less than 20 per cent of that of the Sun, even though
such 'low-metallicity' galaxies often form stars. This raises the question of
whether stars can form in dense gas without molecules, cooling to the required
near-zero temperatures by atomic transitions and dust radiation rather than by
molecular line emission; and it highlights uncertainties about star formation in 
the early Universe, when the metallicity was generally low. Here we report the
detection of CO in two regions of a local dwarf irregular galaxy, WLM, where the 
metallicity is 13 per cent of the solar value. We use new submillimetre
observations and archival far-infrared observations to estimate the cloud masses,
which are both slightly greater than 100,000 solar masses. The clouds have
produced stars at a rate per molecule equal to 10 per cent of that in the local
Orion nebula cloud. The CO fraction of the molecular gas is also low, about 3 per
cent of the Milky Way value. These results suggest that in small galaxies both
star-forming cores and CO molecules become increasingly rare in molecular
hydrogen clouds as the metallicity decreases.

X-ray single-crystal diffraction (SCD) analysis has the intrinsic limitation that
the target molecules must be obtained as single crystals. Here we report a
protocol for SCD analysis that does not require the crystallization of the
sample. In our method, tiny crystals of porous complexes are soaked in a solution
of the target, such that the complexes can absorb the target molecules.
Crystallographic analysis clearly determines the absorbed guest structures along 
with the host frameworks. Because the SCD analysis is carried out on only one
tiny crystal of the complex, the required sample mass is of the
nanogram-microgram order. We demonstrate that as little as about 80 nanograms of 
a sample is enough for the SCD analysis. In combination with high-performance
liquid chromatography, our protocol allows the direct characterization of
multiple fractions, establishing a prototypical means of liquid chromatography
SCD analysis. Furthermore, we unambiguously determined the structure of a scarce 
marine natural product using only 5 micrograms of the compound.

Macrophages consist of at least two subgroups, M1 and M2 (refs 1-3). Whereas M1
macrophages are proinflammatory and have a central role in host defence against
bacterial and viral infections, M2 macrophages are associated with responses to
anti-inflammatory reactions, helminth infection, tissue remodelling, fibrosis and
tumour progression. Trib1 is an adaptor protein involved in protein degradation
by interacting with COP1 ubiquitin ligase. Genome-wide association studies in
humans have implicated TRIB1 in lipid metabolism. Here we show that Trib1 is
critical for the differentiation of F4/80(+)MR(+) tissue-resident
macrophages--that share characteristics with M2 macrophages (which we term
M2-like macrophages)--and eosinophils but not for the differentiation of M1
myeloid cells. Trib1 deficiency results in a severe reduction of M2-like
macrophages in various organs, including bone marrow, spleen, lung and adipose
tissues. Aberrant expression of C/EBPα in Trib1-deficient bone marrow cells is
responsible for the defects in macrophage differentiation. Unexpectedly, mice
lacking Trib1 in haematopoietic cells show diminished adipose tissue mass
accompanied by evidence of increased lipolysis, even when fed a normal diet.
Supplementation of M2-like macrophages rescues the pathophysiology, indicating
that a lack of these macrophages is the cause of lipolysis. In response to a
high-fat diet, mice lacking Trib1 in haematopoietic cells develop
hypertriglyceridaemia and insulin resistance, together with increased
proinflammatory cytokine gene induction. Collectively, these results demonstrate 
that Trib1 is critical for adipose tissue maintenance and suppression of
metabolic disorders by controlling the differentiation of tissue-resident M2-like
macrophages.

A long-held tenet of molecular pharmacology is that canonical signal transduction
mediated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupling to heterotrimeric G
proteins is confined to the plasma membrane. Evidence supporting this traditional
view is based on analytical methods that provide limited or no subcellular
resolution. It has been subsequently proposed that signalling by internalized
GPCRs is restricted to G-protein-independent mechanisms such as scaffolding by
arrestins, or GPCR activation elicits a discrete form of persistent G protein
signalling, or that internalized GPCRs can indeed contribute to the acute
G-protein-mediated response. Evidence supporting these various latter hypotheses 
is indirect or subject to alternative interpretation, and it remains unknown if
endosome-localized GPCRs are even present in an active form. Here we describe the
application of conformation-specific single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) to
directly probe activation of the β2-adrenoceptor, a prototypical GPCR, and its
cognate G protein, Gs (ref. 12), in living mammalian cells. We show that the
adrenergic agonist isoprenaline promotes receptor and G protein activation in the
plasma membrane as expected, but also in the early endosome membrane, and that
internalized receptors contribute to the overall cellular cyclic AMP response
within several minutes after agonist application. These findings provide direct
support for the hypothesis that canonical GPCR signalling occurs from endosomes
as well as the plasma membrane, and suggest a versatile strategy for probing
dynamic conformational change in vivo.

Recent evidence indicates a correlation between orientation of the plant cortical
microtubule cytoskeleton and localization of polar cargoes. However, the
molecules and mechanisms that create this correlation have remained unknown. Here
we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the microtubule orientation regulators
CLASP and MAP65 (refs 3, 4) control the abundance of polarity regulator PINOID
kinase at the plasma membrane. By localized upregulation of clathrin-dependent
endocytosis at cortical microtubule- and clathrin-rich domains orthogonal to the 
axis of polarity, PINOID accelerates the removal of auxin transporter PIN
proteins from those sites. This mechanism links directional microtubule
organization to the polar localization of auxin transporter PIN proteins, and
clarifies how microtubule-enriched cell sides are kept distinct from polar
delivery domains. Our results identify the molecular machinery that connects
microtubule organization to the regulation of the axis of PIN polarization.

A syringe-like injection mechanism in Photorhabdus luminescens toxins.

Photorhabdus luminescens is an insect pathogenic bacterium that is symbiotic with
entomopathogenic nematodes. On invasion of insect larvae, P. luminescens is
released from the nematodes and kills the insect through the action of a variety 
of virulence factors including large tripartite ABC-type toxin complexes (Tcs).
Tcs are typically composed of TcA, TcB and TcC proteins and are biologically
active only when complete. Functioning as ADP-ribosyltransferases, TcC proteins
were identified as the actual functional components that induce actin-clustering,
defects in phagocytosis and cell death. However, little is known about the
translocation of TcC into the cell by the TcA and TcB components. Here we show
that TcA in P. luminescens (TcdA1) forms a transmembrane pore and report its
structure in the prepore and pore state determined by cryoelectron microscopy. We
find that the TcdA1 prepore assembles as a pentamer forming an α-helical,
vuvuzela-shaped channel less than 1.5 nanometres in diameter surrounded by a
large outer shell. Membrane insertion is triggered not only at low pH as
expected, but also at high pH, explaining Tc action directly through the midgut
of insects. Comparisons with structures of the TcdA1 pore inserted into a
membrane and in complex with TcdB2 and TccC3 reveal large conformational changes 
during membrane insertion, suggesting a novel syringe-like mechanism of protein
translocation. Our results demonstrate how ABC-type toxin complexes bridge a
membrane to insert their lethal components into the cytoplasm of the host cell.
We believe that the proposed mechanism is characteristic of the whole ABC-type
toxin family. This explanation of toxin translocation is a step towards
understanding the host-pathogen interaction and the complex life cycle of
P. luminescens and other pathogens, including human pathogenic bacteria, and
serves as a strong foundation for the development of biopesticides.

The two groups of archosaurs, crocodilians and birds, form an extant phylogenetic
bracket for understanding the reproductive behaviour of dinosaurs. This behaviour
is inferred from preserved nests and eggs, and even gravid individuals. Data
indicate that many 'avian' traits were already present in Paraves--the clade that
includes birds and their close relatives--and that the early evolution of the
modern avian form of reproduction was already well on its way. Like living
neornithine birds, non-avian maniraptorans had daily oviposition and asymmetrical
eggs with complex shell microstructure, and were known to protect their clutches.
However, like crocodilians, non-avian maniraptorans had two active oviducts (one 
present in living birds), relatively smaller eggs, and may not have turned their 
eggs in the way that living birds do. Here we report on the first discovery of
fossilized mature or nearly mature ovarian follicles, revealing a previously
undocumented stage in dinosaur reproduction: reproductively active females near
ovulation. Preserved in a specimen of the long bony-tailed Jeholornis and two
enantiornithine birds from the Early Cretaceous period lacustrine Jehol Biota in 
northeastern China, these discoveries indicate that basal birds only had one
functional ovary, but retained primitive morphologies as a result of their lower 
metabolic rate relative to living birds. They also indicate that basal birds
reached sexual maturity before skeletal maturity, as in crocodiles and paravian
dinosaurs. Differences in follicular morphology between Jeholornis and the
enantiornithines are interpreted as forming an evolutionary gradient from the
reproductive condition in paravian dinosaurs towards neornithine birds.
Furthermore, differences between the two enantiornithines indicate that this
lineage might also have evolved advanced reproductive traits in parallel to the
neornithine lineage.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent and characterized by open chromatin and
high transcription levels, achieved through auto-regulatory and feed-forward
transcription factor loops. ES-cell identity is maintained by a core of factors
including Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc (OSKM) and Nanog, and
forced expression of the OSKM factors can reprogram somatic cells into induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resembling ES cells. These gene-specific factors
for RNA-polymerase-II-mediated transcription recruit transcriptional cofactors
and chromatin regulators that control access to and activity of the basal
transcription machinery on gene promoters. How the basal transcription machinery 
is involved in setting and maintaining the pluripotent state is unclear. Here we 
show that knockdown of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex affects the
pluripotent circuitry in mouse ES cells and inhibits reprogramming of
fibroblasts. TFIID subunits and the OSKM factors form a feed-forward loop to
induce and maintain a stable transcription state. Notably, transient expression
of TFIID subunits greatly enhanced reprogramming. These results show that TFIID
is critical for transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming. We anticipate that, 
by creating plasticity in gene expression programs, transcription complexes such 
as TFIID assist reprogramming into different cellular states.

Hemichordates are a marine group that, apart from one monospecific pelagic larval
form, are represented by the vermiform enteropneusts and minute colonial
tube-dwelling pterobranchs. Together with echinoderms, they comprise the clade
Ambulacraria. Despite their restricted diversity, hemichordates provide important
insights into early deuterostome evolution, notably because of their pharyngeal
gill slits. Hemichordate phylogeny has long remained problematic, not least
because the nature of any transitional form that might serve to link the
anatomically disparate enteropneusts and pterobranchs is conjectural. Hence,
inter-relationships have also remained controversial. For example, pterobranchs
have sometimes been compared to ancestral echinoderms. Molecular data identify
enteropneusts as paraphyletic, and harrimaniids as the sister group of
pterobranchs. Recent molecular phylogenies suggest that enteropneusts are
probably basal within hemichordates, contrary to previous views, but otherwise
provide little guidance as to the nature of the primitive hemichordate. In
addition, the hemichordate fossil record is almost entirely restricted to
peridermal skeletons of pterobranchs, notably graptolites. Owing to their low
preservational potentials, fossil enteropneusts are exceedingly rare, and throw
no light on either hemichordate phylogeny or the proposed harrimaniid-pterobranch
transition. Here we describe an enteropneust, Spartobranchus tenuis (Walcott,
1911), from the Middle Cambrian-period (Series 3, Stage 5) Burgess Shale. It is
remarkably similar to the extant harrimaniids, but differs from all known
enteropneusts in that it is associated with a fibrous tube that is sometimes
branched. We suggest that this is the precursor of the pterobranch periderm, and 
supports the hypothesis that pterobranchs are miniaturized and derived from an
enteropneust-like worm. It also shows that the periderm was acquired before size 
reduction and acquisition of feeding tentacles, and that coloniality emerged
through aggregation of individuals, perhaps similar to the Cambrian rhabdopleurid
Fasciculitubus. The presence of both enteropneusts and pterobranchs in Middle
Cambrian strata, suggests that hemichordates originated at the onset of the
Cambrian explosion.

CLP1 was the first mammalian RNA kinase to be identified. However, determining
its in vivo function has been elusive. Here we generated kinase-dead Clp1
(Clp1(K/K)) mice that show a progressive loss of spinal motor neurons associated 
with axonal degeneration in the peripheral nerves and denervation of
neuromuscular junctions, resulting in impaired motor function, muscle weakness,
paralysis and fatal respiratory failure. Transgenic rescue experiments show that 
CLP1 functions in motor neurons. Mechanistically, loss of CLP1 activity results
in accumulation of a novel set of small RNA fragments, derived from aberrant
processing of tyrosine pre-transfer RNA. These tRNA fragments sensitize cells to 
oxidative-stress-induced p53 (also known as TRP53) activation and p53-dependent
cell death. Genetic inactivation of p53 rescues Clp1(K/K) mice from the motor
neuron loss, muscle denervation and respiratory failure. Our experiments uncover 
a mechanistic link between tRNA processing, formation of a new RNA species and
progressive loss of lower motor neurons regulated by p53.

Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that around 250
human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with
neurodegenerative disease, harbour a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD)
enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding
proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However,
the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we 
define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins 
(hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle,
brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1
show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is
exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen
a 'steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of
self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, 
the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into
stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal
models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization
caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative
disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates
for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor
neuron and bone.

Eukaryotic transcription initiation requires the assembly of general
transcription factors into a pre-initiation complex that ensures the accurate
loading of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the transcription start site. The
molecular mechanism and function of this assembly have remained elusive due to
lack of structural information. Here we have used an in vitro reconstituted
system to study the stepwise assembly of human TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, Pol II, TFIIF, 
TFIIE and TFIIH onto promoter DNA using cryo-electron microscopy. Our structural 
analyses provide pseudo-atomic models at various stages of transcription
initiation that illuminate critical molecular interactions, including how TFIIF
engages Pol II and promoter DNA to stabilize both the closed pre-initiation
complex and the open-promoter complex, and to regulate start--initiation
complexes, combined with the localization of the TFIIH helicases XPD and XPB,
support a DNA translocation model of XPB and explain its essential role in
promoter opening.

The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) separates rigid oceanic plates from 
the underlying warm ductile asthenosphere. Although a viscosity decrease beneath 
this boundary is essential for plate tectonics, a consensus on its origin remains
elusive. Seismic studies identify a prominent velocity discontinuity at depths
thought to coincide with the LAB but disagree on its cause, generally invoking
either partial melting or a mantle dehydration boundary as explanations. Here we 
use sea-floor magnetotelluric data to image the electrical conductivity of the
LAB beneath the edge of the Cocos plate at the Middle America trench offshore of 
Nicaragua. Underneath the resistive oceanic lithosphere, the magnetotelluric data
reveal a high-conductivity layer confined to depths of 45 to 70 kilometres.
Because partial melts are stable at these depths in a warm damp mantle, we
interpret the conductor to be a partially molten layer capped by an impermeable
frozen lid that is the base of the lithosphere. A conductivity anisotropy
parallel to plate motion indicates that this melt has been sheared into
flow-aligned tube-like structures. We infer that the LAB beneath young plates
consists of a thin, partially molten, channel of low viscosity that acts to
decouple the overlying brittle lithosphere from the deeper convecting mantle.
Because this boundary layer has the potential to behave as a lubricant to plate
motion, its proximity to the trench may have implications for subduction
dynamics.

Human activities have doubled the pre-industrial supply of reactive nitrogen on
Earth, and future rates of increase are expected to accelerate. Yet little is
known about the capacity of the biosphere to buffer increased nitrogen influx.
Past changes in global ecosystems following deglaciation at the end of the
Pleistocene epoch provide an opportunity to understand better how nitrogen
cycling in the terrestrial biosphere responded to changes in carbon cycling. We
analysed published records of stable nitrogen isotopic values (δ(15)N) in
sediments from 86 lakes on six continents. Here we show that the value of
sedimentary δ(15)N declined from 15,000 years before present to 7,056 ± 597 years
before present, a period of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations 
and terrestrial carbon accumulation. Comparison of the nitrogen isotope record
with concomitant carbon accumulation on land and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere 
suggests millennia of declining nitrogen availability in terrestrial ecosystems
during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition around 11,000 years before present. In
contrast, we do not observe a consistent change in global sedimentary δ(15)N
values during the past 500 years, despite the potential effects of changing
temperature and nitrogen influx from anthropogenic sources. We propose that the
lack of a single response may indicate that modern increases in atmospheric
carbon dioxide and net carbon sequestration in the biosphere have the potential
to offset recent increased supplies of reactive nitrogen in some ecosystems.

Multiview three-dimensional (3D) displays can project the correct perspectives of
a 3D image in many spatial directions simultaneously. They provide a 3D
stereoscopic experience to many viewers at the same time with full motion
parallax and do not require special glasses or eye tracking. None of the leading 
multiview 3D solutions is particularly well suited to mobile devices (watches,
mobile phones or tablets), which require the combination of a thin, portable form
factor, a high spatial resolution and a wide full-parallax view zone (for short
viewing distance from potentially steep angles). Here we introduce a
multi-directional diffractive backlight technology that permits the rendering of 
high-resolution, full-parallax 3D images in a very wide view zone (up to 180
degrees in principle) at an observation distance of up to a metre. The key to our
design is a guided-wave illumination technique based on light-emitting diodes
that produces wide-angle multiview images in colour from a thin planar
transparent lightguide. Pixels associated with different views or colours are
spatially multiplexed and can be independently addressed and modulated at video
rate using an external shutter plane. To illustrate the capabilities of this
technology, we use simple ink masks or a high-resolution commercial
liquid-crystal display unit to demonstrate passive and active (30 frames per
second) modulation of a 64-view backlight, producing 3D images with a spatial
resolution of 88 pixels per inch and full-motion parallax in an unprecedented
view zone of 90 degrees. We also present several transparent hand-held prototypes
showing animated sequences of up to six different 200-view images at a resolution
of 127 pixels per inch.

Multiple phases of chondrocyte enlargement underlie differences in skeletal
proportions.

The wide diversity of skeletal proportions in mammals is evident upon a survey of
any natural history museum's collections and allows us to distinguish between
species even when reduced to their calcified components. Similarly, each
individual is comprised of a variety of bones of differing lengths. The largest
contribution to the lengthening of a skeletal element, and to the differential
elongation of elements, comes from a dramatic increase in the volume of
hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate as they undergo terminal
differentiation. However, the mechanisms of chondrocyte volume enlargement have
remained a mystery. Here we use quantitative phase microscopy to show that
mammalian chondrocytes undergo three distinct phases of volume increase,
including a phase of massive cell swelling in which the cellular dry mass is
significantly diluted. In light of the tight fluid regulatory mechanisms known to
control volume in many cell types, this is a remarkable mechanism for increasing 
cell size and regulating growth rate. It is, however, the duration of the final
phase of volume enlargement by proportional dry mass increase at low density that
varies most between rapidly and slowly elongating growth plates. Moreover, we
find that this third phase is locally regulated through a mechanism dependent on 
insulin-like growth factor. This study provides a framework for understanding how
skeletal size is regulated and for exploring how cells sense, modify and
establish a volume set point.

Maintenance of body temperature is essential for the survival of homeotherms.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized fat tissue that is dedicated to
thermoregulation. Owing to its remarkable capacity to dissipate stored energy and
its demonstrated presence in adult humans, BAT holds great promise for the
treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Rodent data suggest the existence of
two types of brown fat cells: constitutive BAT (cBAT), which is of embryonic
origin and anatomically located in the interscapular region of mice; and
recruitable BAT (rBAT), which resides within white adipose tissue (WAT) and
skeletal muscle, and has alternatively been called beige, brite or inducible BAT.
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the formation and thermogenic
activity of BAT. Here we use mouse models to provide evidence for a systemically 
active regulatory mechanism that controls whole-body BAT activity for
thermoregulation and energy homeostasis. Genetic ablation of the type 1A BMP
receptor (Bmpr1a) in brown adipogenic progenitor cells leads to a severe paucity 
of cBAT. This in turn increases sympathetic input to WAT, thereby promoting the
formation of rBAT within white fat depots. This previously unknown compensatory
mechanism, aimed at restoring total brown-fat-mediated thermogenic capacity in
the body, is sufficient to maintain normal temperature homeostasis and resistance
to diet-induced obesity. These data suggest an important physiological cross-talk
between constitutive and recruitable brown fat cells. This sophisticated
regulatory mechanism of body temperature may participate in the control of energy
balance and metabolic disease.

Multidomain integration in the structure of the HNF-4α nuclear receptor complex.

The hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α; also known as NR2A1) is a member of the
nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, which have conserved
DNA-binding domains and ligand-binding domains. HNF-4α is the most abundant
DNA-binding protein in the liver, where some 40% of the actively transcribed
genes have a HNF-4α response element. These regulated genes are largely involved 
in the hepatic gluconeogenic program and lipid metabolism. In the pancreas HNF-4α
is also a master regulator, controlling an estimated 11% of islet genes. HNF-4α
protein mutations are linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1
(MODY1) and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Previous structural analyses of NRs,
although productive in elucidating the structure of individual domains, have
lagged behind in revealing the connectivity patterns of NR domains. Here we
describe the 2.9 Å crystal structure of the multidomain human HNF-4α homodimer
bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides. A convergence
zone connects multiple receptor domains in an asymmetric fashion, joining
distinct elements from each monomer. An arginine target of PRMT1 methylation
protrudes directly into this convergence zone and sustains its integrity. A
serine target of protein kinase C is also responsible for maintaining
domain-domain interactions. These post-translational modifications lead to
changes in DNA binding by communicating through the tightly connected surfaces of
the quaternary fold. We find that some MODY1 mutations, positioned on the
ligand-binding domain and hinge regions of the receptor, compromise DNA binding
at a distance by communicating through the interjunctional surfaces of the
complex. The overall domain representation of the HNF-4α homodimer is different
from that of the PPAR-γ-RXR-α heterodimer, even when both NR complexes are
assembled on the same DNA element. Our findings suggest that unique quaternary
folds and interdomain connections in NRs could be exploited by small-molecule
allosteric modulators that affect distal functions in these polypeptides.

In the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has been revolutionized
by the discovery that luminous, dusty starburst galaxies were 1,000 times more
abundant in the early Universe than at present. It has, however, been difficult
to measure the complete redshift distribution of these objects, especially at the
highest redshifts (z > 4). Here we report a redshift survey at a wavelength of
three millimetres, targeting carbon monoxide line emission from the star-forming 
molecular gas in the direction of extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected
sources. High-resolution imaging demonstrates that these sources are strongly
gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. We detect spectral lines in 23 out
of 26 sources and multiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain 
robust, unambiguous redshifts. At least 10 of the sources are found to lie at
z > 4, indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts
is greater than previously thought. Models of lens geometries in the sample
indicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies,
powered by extreme bursts of star formation.

To maintain lifelong production of blood cells, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) 
are tightly regulated by inherent programs and extrinsic regulatory signals
received from their microenvironmental niche. Long-term repopulating HSCs reside 
in several, perhaps overlapping, niches that produce regulatory molecules and
signals necessary for homeostasis and for increased output after stress or
injury. Despite considerable advances in the specific cellular or molecular
mechanisms governing HSC-niche interactions, little is known about the regulatory
function in the intact mammalian haematopoietic niche. Recently, we and others
described a positive regulatory role for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on HSC function 
ex vivo. Here we show that inhibition of endogenous PGE2 by non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment in mice results in modest HSC egress
from the bone marrow. Surprisingly, this was independent of the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis 
implicated in stem-cell migration. Stem and progenitor cells were found to have
differing mechanisms of egress, with HSC transit to the periphery dependent on
niche attenuation and reduction in the retentive molecule osteopontin.
Haematopoietic grafts mobilized with NSAIDs had superior repopulating ability and
long-term engraftment. Treatment of non-human primates and healthy human
volunteers confirmed NSAID-mediated egress in other species. PGE2 receptor
knockout mice demonstrated that progenitor expansion and stem/progenitor egress
resulted from reduced E-prostanoid 4 (EP4) receptor signalling. These results not
only uncover unique regulatory roles for EP4 signalling in HSC retention in the
niche, but also define a rapidly translatable strategy to enhance transplantation
therapeutically.

The regulated loading of the Mcm2-7 DNA helicase (comprising six related
subunits, Mcm2 to Mcm7) into pre-replicative complexes at multiple replication
origins ensures precise once per cell cycle replication in eukaryotic cells. The 
origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 load Mcm2-7 into a double hexamer
bound around duplex DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, but the molecular mechanism
of this origin 'licensing' is still poorly understood. Here we show that both
Mcm2-7 hexamers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are recruited to origins by an
essential, conserved carboxy-terminal domain of Mcm3 that interacts with and
stimulates the ATPase activity of ORC-Cdc6. ATP hydrolysis can promote Mcm2-7
loading, but can also promote Mcm2-7 release if components are missing or if ORC 
has been inactivated by cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation. Our work
provides new insights into how origins are licensed and reveals a novel
ATPase-dependent mechanism contributing to precise once per cell cycle
replication.

Autophagy is a tightly regulated intracellular bulk degradation/recycling system 
that has fundamental roles in cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is initiated by
isolation membranes, which form and elongate as they engulf portions of the
cytoplasm and organelles. Eventually isolation membranes close to form double
membrane-bound autophagosomes and fuse with lysosomes to degrade their contents. 
The physiological role of autophagy has been determined since its discovery, but 
the origin of autophagosomal membranes has remained unclear. At present, there is
much controversy about the organelle from which the membranes originate--the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and plasma membrane. Here we show that
autophagosomes form at the ER-mitochondria contact site in mammalian cells.
Imaging data reveal that the pre-autophagosome/autophagosome marker ATG14 (also
known as ATG14L) relocalizes to the ER-mitochondria contact site after
starvation, and the autophagosome-formation marker ATG5 also localizes at the
site until formation is complete. Subcellular fractionation showed that ATG14
co-fractionates in the mitochondria-associated ER membrane fraction under
starvation conditions. Disruption of the ER-mitochondria contact site prevents
the formation of ATG14 puncta. The ER-resident SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) 
binds ATG14 and recruits it to the ER-mitochondria contact site. These results
provide new insight into organelle biogenesis by demonstrating that the
ER-mitochondria contact site is important in autophagosome formation.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in animals are an enigmatic class of RNA with unknown
function. To explore circRNAs systematically, we sequenced and computationally
analysed human, mouse and nematode RNA. We detected thousands of well-expressed, 
stable circRNAs, often showing tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression.
Sequence analysis indicated important regulatory functions for circRNAs. We found
that a human circRNA, antisense to the cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 
transcript (CDR1as), is densely bound by microRNA (miRNA) effector complexes and 
harbours 63 conserved binding sites for the ancient miRNA miR-7. Further analyses
indicated that CDR1as functions to bind miR-7 in neuronal tissues. Human CDR1as
expression in zebrafish impaired midbrain development, similar to knocking down
miR-7, suggesting that CDR1as is a miRNA antagonist with a miRNA-binding capacity
ten times higher than any other known transcript. Together, our data provide
evidence that circRNAs form a large class of post-transcriptional regulators.
Numerous circRNAs form by head-to-tail splicing of exons, suggesting previously
unrecognized regulatory potential of coding sequences.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression that act by direct base pairing to target sites within untranslated
regions of messenger RNAs. Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be affected
by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing endogenous
RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants. We previously identified a highly
expressed circular RNA (circRNA) in human and mouse brain. Here we show that this
circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript ciRS-7 (circular
RNA sponge for miR-7). ciRS-7 contains more than 70 selectively conserved miRNA
target sites, and it is highly and widely associated with Argonaute (AGO)
proteins in a miR-7-dependent manner. Although the circRNA is completely
resistant to miRNA-mediated target destabilization, it strongly suppresses miR-7 
activity, resulting in increased levels of miR-7 targets. In the mouse brain, we 
observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7, particularly in
neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of endogenous
interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, sex-determining
region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that miRNA sponge effects 
achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. This study serves as the 
first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a naturally expressed circRNA.

Speaking is one of the most complex actions that we perform, but nearly all of us
learn to do it effortlessly. Production of fluent speech requires the precise,
coordinated movement of multiple articulators (for example, the lips, jaw, tongue
and larynx) over rapid time scales. Here we used high-resolution, multi-electrode
cortical recordings during the production of consonant-vowel syllables to
determine the organization of speech sensorimotor cortex in humans. We found
speech-articulator representations that are arranged somatotopically on ventral
pre- and post-central gyri, and that partially overlap at individual electrodes. 
These representations were coordinated temporally as sequences during syllable
production. Spatial patterns of cortical activity showed an emergent,
population-level representation, which was organized by phonetic features. Over
tens of milliseconds, the spatial patterns transitioned between distinct
representations for different consonants and vowels. These results reveal the
dynamic organization of speech sensorimotor cortex during the generation of
multi-articulator movements that underlies our ability to speak.

Molecular control of the pluripotent state is thought to reside in a core
circuitry of master transcription factors including the homeodomain-containing
protein NANOG, which has an essential role in establishing ground state
pluripotency during somatic cell reprogramming. Whereas the genomic occupancy of 
NANOG has been extensively investigated, comparatively little is known about
NANOG-associated proteins and their contribution to the NANOG-mediated
reprogramming process. Using enhanced purification techniques and a stringent
computational algorithm, we identify 27 high-confidence protein interaction
partners of NANOG in mouse embryonic stem cells. These consist of 19 previously
unknown partners of NANOG that have not been reported before, including the
ten-eleven translocation (TET) family methylcytosine hydroxylase TET1. We confirm
physical association of NANOG with TET1, and demonstrate that TET1, in synergy
with NANOG, enhances the efficiency of reprogramming. We also find physical
association and reprogramming synergy of TET2 with NANOG, and demonstrate that
knockdown of TET2 abolishes the reprogramming synergy of NANOG with a
catalytically deficient mutant of TET1. These results indicate that the physical 
interaction between NANOG and TET1/TET2 proteins facilitates reprogramming in a
manner that is dependent on the catalytic activity of TET1/TET2. TET1 and NANOG
co-occupy genomic loci of genes associated with both maintenance of pluripotency 
and lineage commitment in embryonic stem cells, and TET1 binding is reduced upon 
NANOG depletion. Co-expression of NANOG and TET1 increases
5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels at the top-ranked common target loci Esrrb and
Oct4 (also called Pou5f1), resulting in priming of their expression before
reprogramming to naive pluripotency. We propose that TET1 is recruited by NANOG
to enhance the expression of a subset of key reprogramming target genes. These
results provide an insight into the reprogramming mechanism of NANOG and uncover 
a new role for 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases in the establishment of naive
pluripotency.

The domestication of dogs was an important episode in the development of human
civilization. The precise timing and location of this event is debated and little
is known about the genetic changes that accompanied the transformation of ancient
wolves into domestic dogs. Here we conduct whole-genome resequencing of dogs and 
wolves to identify 3.8 million genetic variants used to identify 36 genomic
regions that probably represent targets for selection during dog domestication.
Nineteen of these regions contain genes important in brain function, eight of
which belong to nervous system development pathways and potentially underlie
behavioural changes central to dog domestication. Ten genes with key roles in
starch digestion and fat metabolism also show signals of selection. We identify
candidate mutations in key genes and provide functional support for an increased 
starch digestion in dogs relative to wolves. Our results indicate that novel
adaptations allowing the early ancestors of modern dogs to thrive on a diet rich 
in starch, relative to the carnivorous diet of wolves, constituted a crucial step
in the early domestication of dogs.

Centrosome duplication is critical for cell division, and genome instability can 
result if duplication is not restricted to a single round per cell cycle.
Centrosome duplication is controlled in part by CP110, a centriolar protein that 
positively regulates centriole duplication while restricting centriole elongation
and ciliogenesis. Maintenance of normal CP110 levels is essential, as excessive
CP110 drives centrosome over-duplication and suppresses ciliogenesis, whereas its
depletion inhibits centriole amplification and leads to highly elongated
centrioles and aberrant assembly of cilia in growing cells. CP110 levels are
tightly controlled, partly through ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase complex
SCF(cyclin F) during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Here, using human cells, 
we report a new mechanism for the regulation of centrosome duplication that
requires USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme that is able to regulate CP110 levels. 
USP33 interacts with CP110 and localizes to centrioles primarily in S and G2/M
phases, the periods during which centrioles duplicate and elongate. USP33
potently and specifically deubiquitinates CP110, but not other cyclin-F
substrates. USP33 activity antagonizes SCF(cyclin F)-mediated ubiquitination and 
promotes the generation of supernumerary centriolar foci, whereas ablation of
USP33 destabilizes CP110 and thereby inhibits centrosome amplification and
mitotic defects. To our knowledge, we have identified the first centriolar
deubiquitinating enzyme whose expression regulates centrosome homeostasis by
countering cyclin-F-mediated destruction of a key substrate. Our results point
towards potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting tumorigenesis associated 
with centrosome amplification.

Most human coronaviruses cause mild upper respiratory tract disease but may be
associated with more severe pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals.
However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10%
mortality and evidence of systemic spread. Recently, another coronavirus (human
coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with
severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection. Viral genome
analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats. Here we
identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional
receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding S1
domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells.
Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human
bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat
(Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection
by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different 
species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of
hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the 
pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may
facilitate the development of intervention strategies.

In mammals, sex differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is determined by 
extrinsic cues from the environment. In mouse female PGCs, expression of
stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) and meiosis are induced in response to
retinoic acid provided from the mesonephroi. Given the widespread role of
retinoic acid signalling during development, the molecular mechanisms that enable
PGCs to express Stra8 and enter meiosis in a timely manner are unknown. Here we
identify gene-dosage-dependent roles in PGC development for Ring1 and Rnf2, two
central components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Both paralogues
are essential for PGC development between days 10.5 and 11.5 of gestation. Rnf2
is subsequently required in female PGCs to maintain high levels of Oct4 (also
known as Pou5f1) and Nanog expression, and to prevent premature induction of
meiotic gene expression and entry into meiotic prophase. Chemical inhibition of
retinoic acid signalling partially suppresses precocious Oct4 downregulation and 
Stra8 activation in Rnf2-deficient female PGCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
analyses show that Stra8 is a direct target of PRC1 and PRC2 in PGCs. These data 
demonstrate the importance of PRC1 gene dosage in PGC development and in
coordinating the timing of sex differentiation of female PGCs by antagonizing
extrinsic retinoic acid signalling.

In the deep, chemically reducing parts of Earth's mantle, hydrous fluids contain 
significant amounts of molecular hydrogen (H2). Thermodynamic models of fluids in
Earth's mantle so far have always assumed that molecular hydrogen and water are
completely miscible. Here we show experimental evidence that water and hydrogen
can coexist as two separate, immiscible phases. Immiscibility between water and
hydrogen may be the cause of the formation of enigmatic, ultra-reducing domains
in the mantle that contain moissanite (SiC) and other phases indicative of
extremely reducing conditions. Moreover, the immiscibility between water and
hydrogen may provide a mechanism for the rapid oxidation of Earth's upper mantle 
immediately following core formation.

Coherent state transfer between itinerant microwave fields and a mechanical
oscillator.

Macroscopic mechanical oscillators have been coaxed into a regime of quantum
behaviour by direct refrigeration or a combination of refrigeration and
laser-like cooling. This result supports the idea that mechanical oscillators may
perform useful functions in the processing of quantum information with
superconducting circuits, either by serving as a quantum memory for the ephemeral
state of a microwave field or by providing a quantum interface between otherwise 
incompatible systems. As yet, the transfer of an itinerant state or a propagating
mode of a microwave field to and from a storage medium has not been demonstrated,
owing to the inability to turn on and off the interaction between the microwave
field and the medium sufficiently quickly. Here we demonstrate that the state of 
an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into, stored in and
retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the single-quantum
level. Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the microwave state is
shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical oscillator. In this
quantum regime, the mechanical oscillator can both store quantum information and 
enable its transfer between otherwise incompatible systems.

To create and manipulate non-classical states of light for quantum information
protocols, a strong, nonlinear interaction at the single-photon level is
required. One approach to the generation of suitable interactions is to couple
photons to atoms, as in the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum
electrodynamic systems. In these systems, however, the quantum state of the light
is only indirectly controlled by manipulating the atoms. A direct photon-photon
interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which typically induce only weak
nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So far, it has not been possible to
reach the single-photon Kerr regime, in which the interaction strength between
individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here, using a three-dimensional circuit
quantum electrodynamic architecture, we engineer an artificial Kerr medium that
enters this regime and allows the observation of new quantum effects. We realize 
a gedanken experiment in which the collapse and revival of a coherent state can
be observed. This time evolution is a consequence of the quantization of the
light field in the cavity and the nonlinear interaction between individual
photons. During the evolution, non-classical superpositions of coherent states
(that is, multi-component 'Schrödinger cat' states) are formed. We visualize this
evolution by measuring the Husimi Q function and confirm the non-classical
properties of these transient states by cavity state tomography. The ability to
create and manipulate superpositions of coherent states in such a
high-quality-factor photon mode opens perspectives for combining the physics of
continuous variables with superconducting circuits. The single-photon Kerr effect
could be used in quantum non-demolition measurement of photons, single-photon
generation, autonomous quantum feedback schemes and quantum logic operations.

Magnetic resonance is an exceptionally powerful and versatile measurement
technique. The basic structure of a magnetic resonance experiment has remained
largely unchanged for almost 50 years, being mainly restricted to the qualitative
probing of only a limited set of the properties that can in principle be accessed
by this technique. Here we introduce an approach to data acquisition,
post-processing and visualization--which we term 'magnetic resonance
fingerprinting' (MRF)--that permits the simultaneous non-invasive quantification 
of multiple important properties of a material or tissue. MRF thus provides an
alternative way to quantitatively detect and analyse complex changes that can
represent physical alterations of a substance or early indicators of disease. MRF
can also be used to identify the presence of a specific target material or
tissue, which will increase the sensitivity, specificity and speed of a magnetic 
resonance study, and potentially lead to new diagnostic testing methodologies.
When paired with an appropriate pattern-recognition algorithm, MRF inherently
suppresses measurement errors and can thus improve measurement accuracy.

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) originates from the Andes and evolved
short-day-dependent tuber formation as a vegetative propagation strategy. Here we
describe the identification of a central regulator underlying a major-effect
quantitative trait locus for plant maturity and initiation of tuber development. 
We show that this gene belongs to the family of DOF (DNA-binding with one finger)
transcription factors and regulates tuberization and plant life cycle length, by 
acting as a mediator between the circadian clock and the StSP6A mobile
tuberization signal. We also show that natural allelic variants evade
post-translational light regulation, allowing cultivation outside the
geographical centre of origin of potato. Potato is a member of the Solanaceae
family and is one of the world's most important food crops. This annual plant
originates from the Andean regions of South America. Potato develops tubers from 
underground stems called stolons. Its equatorial origin makes potato essentially 
short-day dependent for tuberization and potato will not make tubers in the
long-day conditions of spring and summer in the northern latitudes. When
introduced in temperate zones, wild material will form tubers in the course of
the autumnal shortening of day-length. Thus, one of the first selected traits in 
potato leading to a European potato type is likely to have been long-day
acclimation for tuberization. Potato breeders can exploit the naturally occurring
variation in tuberization onset and life cycle length, allowing varietal breeding
for different latitudes, harvest times and markets.

Natural epigenetic variation provides a source for the generation of phenotypic
diversity, but to understand its contribution to such diversity, its interaction 
with genetic variation requires further investigation. Here we report
population-wide DNA sequencing of genomes, transcriptomes and methylomes of wild 
Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Single cytosine methylation polymorphisms are
not linked to genotype. However, the rate of linkage disequilibrium decay amongst
differentially methylated regions targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation is
similar to the rate for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Association analyses of 
these RNA-directed DNA methylation regions with genetic variants identified
thousands of methylation quantitative trait loci, which revealed the population
estimate of genetically dependent methylation variation. Analysis of invariably
methylated transposons and genes across this population indicates that loci
targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation are epigenetically activated in pollen
and seeds, which facilitates proper development of these structures.

Mesoporous ceramics and semiconductors enable low-cost solar power, solar fuel,
(photo)catalyst and electrical energy storage technologies. State-of-the-art,
printable high-surface-area electrodes are fabricated from thermally sintered
pre-formed nanocrystals. Mesoporosity provides the desired highly accessible
surfaces but many applications also demand long-range electronic connectivity and
structural coherence. A mesoporous single-crystal (MSC) semiconductor can meet
both criteria. Here we demonstrate a general synthetic method of growing
semiconductor MSCs of anatase TiO2 based on seeded nucleation and growth inside a
mesoporous template immersed in a dilute reaction solution. We show that both
isolated MSCs and ensembles incorporated into films have substantially higher
conductivities and electron mobilities than does nanocrystalline TiO2.
Conventional nanocrystals, unlike MSCs, require in-film thermal sintering to
reinforce electronic contact between particles, thus increasing fabrication cost,
limiting the use of flexible substrates and precluding, for instance,
multijunction solar cell processing. Using MSC films processed entirely below
150 °C, we have fabricated all-solid-state, low-temperature sensitized solar
cells that have 7.3 per cent efficiency, the highest efficiency yet reported.
These high-surface-area anatase single crystals will find application in many
different technologies, and this generic synthetic strategy extends the
possibility of mesoporous single-crystal growth to a range of functional ceramics
and semiconductors.

Recognition of sweet, bitter and umami tastes requires the non-vesicular release 
from taste bud cells of ATP, which acts as a neurotransmitter to activate
afferent neural gustatory pathways. However, how ATP is released to fulfil this
function is not fully understood. Here we show that calcium homeostasis modulator
1 (CALHM1), a voltage-gated ion channel, is indispensable for
taste-stimuli-evoked ATP release from sweet-, bitter- and umami-sensing taste bud
cells. Calhm1 knockout mice have severely impaired perceptions of sweet, bitter
and umami compounds, whereas their recognition of sour and salty tastes remains
mostly normal. Calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without interfering
with taste cell development or integrity. CALHM1 is expressed specifically in
sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type II taste bud cells. Its heterologous expression
induces a novel ATP permeability that releases ATP from cells in response to
manipulations that activate the CALHM1 ion channel. Knockout of Calhm1 strongly
reduces voltage-gated currents in type II cells and taste-evoked ATP release from
taste buds without affecting the excitability of taste cells by taste stimuli.
Thus, CALHM1 is a voltage-gated ATP-release channel required for sweet, bitter
and umami taste perception.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among
women in the United States, but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Some
epithelial cancers are known to occur in transitional zones between two types of 
epithelium, whereas others have been shown to originate in epithelial tissue stem
cells. The stem cell niche of the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), which is
ruptured and regenerates during ovulation, has not yet been defined
unequivocally. Here we identify the hilum region of the mouse ovary, the
transitional (or junction) area between the OSE, mesothelium and tubal
(oviductal) epithelium, as a previously unrecognized stem cell niche of the OSE. 
We find that cells of the hilum OSE are cycling slowly and express stem and/or
progenitor cell markers ALDH1, LGR5, LEF1, CD133 and CK6B. These cells display
long-term stem cell properties ex vivo and in vivo, as shown by our serial sphere
generation and long-term lineage-tracing assays. Importantly, the hilum cells
show increased transformation potential after inactivation of tumour suppressor
genes Trp53 and Rb1, whose pathways are altered frequently in the most aggressive
and common type of human EOC, high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. Our study
supports experimentally the idea that susceptibility of transitional zones to
malignant transformation may be explained by the presence of stem cell niches in 
those areas. Identification of a stem cell niche for the OSE may have important
implications for understanding EOC pathogenesis.

cytoplasm.

The contraction and relaxation of muscle cells is controlled by the successive
rise and fall of cytosolic Ca(2+), initiated by the release of Ca(2+) from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum and terminated by re-sequestration of Ca(2+) into the
sarcoplasmic reticulum as the main mechanism of Ca(2+) removal. Re-sequestration 
requires active transport and is catalysed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum
Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), which has a key role in defining the contractile
properties of skeletal and heart muscle tissue. The activity of SERCA is
regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB,
also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Detailed structural information
explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural
features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the
intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. Here we report the 
crystal structure of rabbit SERCA1a (also known as ATP2A1) in complex with SLN at
3.1 Å resolution. The regulatory SLN traps the Ca(2+)-ATPase in a previously
undescribed E1 state, with exposure of the Ca(2+) sites through an open
cytoplasmic pathway stabilized by Mg(2+). The structure suggests a mechanism for 
selective Ca(2+) loading and activation of SERCA, and provides new insight into
how SLN and PLB inhibition arises from stabilization of this E1 intermediate
state without bound Ca(2+). These findings may prove useful in studying how
autoinhibitory domains of other ion pumps modulate transport across biological
membranes.

P-type ATPases are ATP-powered ion pumps that establish ion concentration
gradients across biological membranes, and are distinct from other ATPases in
that the reaction cycle includes an autophosphorylation step. The best studied is
Ca(2+)-ATPase from muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a), a Ca(2+) pump that
relaxes muscle cells after contraction, and crystal structures have been
determined for most of the reaction intermediates. An important outstanding
structure is that of the E1 intermediate, which has empty high-affinity
Ca(2+)-binding sites ready to accept new cytosolic Ca(2+). In the absence of
Ca(2+) and at pH 7 or higher, the ATPase is predominantly in E1, not in E2 (low
affinity for Ca(2+)), and if millimolar Mg(2+) is present, one Mg(2+) is expected
to occupy one of the Ca(2+)-binding sites with a millimolar dissociation
constant. This Mg(2+) accelerates the reaction cycle, not permitting
phosphorylation without Ca(2+) binding. Here we describe the crystal structure of
native SERCA1a (from rabbit) in this E1·Mg(2+) state at 3.0 Å resolution in
addition to crystal structures of SERCA1a in E2 free from exogenous inhibitors,
and address the structural basis of the activation signal for phosphoryl
transfer. Unexpectedly, sarcolipin, a small regulatory membrane protein of
Ca(2+)-ATPase, is bound, stabilizing the E1·Mg(2+) state. Sarcolipin is a close
homologue of phospholamban, which is a critical mediator of β-adrenergic signal
in Ca(2+) regulation in heart (for reviews, see, for example, refs 8-10), and
seems to play an important role in muscle-based thermogenesis. We also determined
the crystal structure of recombinant SERCA1a devoid of sarcolipin, and describe
the structural basis of inhibition by sarcolipin/phospholamban. Thus, the crystal
structures reported here fill a gap in the structural elucidation of the reaction
cycle and provide a solid basis for understanding the physiological regulation of
the calcium pump.

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) primarily reside in the bone marrow where
signals generated by stromal cells regulate their self-renewal, proliferation and
trafficking. Endosteal osteoblasts and perivascular stromal cells including
endothelial cells, CXCL12-abundant reticular cells, leptin-receptor-positive
stromal cells, and nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive mesenchymal
progenitors have all been implicated in HSC maintenance. However, it is unclear
whether specific haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) subsets reside in distinct 
niches defined by the surrounding stromal cells and the regulatory molecules they
produce. CXCL12 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12) regulates both HSCs and
lymphoid progenitors and is expressed by all of these stromal cell populations.
Here we selectively deleted Cxcl12 from candidate niche stromal cell populations 
and characterized the effect on HPCs. Deletion of Cxcl12 from mineralizing
osteoblasts has no effect on HSCs or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12
from osterix-expressing stromal cells, which include CXCL12-abundant reticular
cells and osteoblasts, results in constitutive HPC mobilization and a loss of
B-lymphoid progenitors, but HSC function is normal. Cxcl12 deletion from
endothelial cells results in a modest loss of long-term repopulating activity.
Strikingly, deletion of Cxcl12 from nestin-negative mesenchymal progenitors using
Prx1-cre (Prx1 also known as Prrx1) is associated with a marked loss of HSCs,
long-term repopulating activity, HSC quiescence and common lymphoid progenitors. 
These data suggest that osterix-expressing stromal cells comprise a distinct
niche that supports B-lymphoid progenitors and retains HPCs in the bone marrow,
and that expression of CXCL12 from stromal cells in the perivascular region,
including endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, supports HSCs.

Although haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are commonly assumed to reside within a
specialized microenvironment, or niche, most published experimental manipulations
of the HSC niche have affected the function of diverse restricted progenitors.
This raises the fundamental question of whether HSCs and restricted progenitors
reside within distinct, specialized niches or whether they share a common niche. 
Here we assess the physiological sources of the chemokine CXCL12 for HSC and
restricted progenitor maintenance. Cxcl12(DsRed) knock-in mice (DsRed-Express2
recombined into the Cxcl12 locus) showed that Cxcl12 was primarily expressed by
perivascular stromal cells and, at lower levels, by endothelial cells,
osteoblasts and some haematopoietic cells. Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 from
haematopoietic cells or nestin-cre-expressing cells had little or no effect on
HSCs or restricted progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from endothelial cells
depleted HSCs but not myeloerythroid or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 
from perivascular stromal cells depleted HSCs and certain restricted progenitors 
and mobilized these cells into circulation. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osteoblasts
depleted certain early lymphoid progenitors but not HSCs or myeloerythroid
progenitors, and did not mobilize these cells into circulation. Different stem
and progenitor cells thus reside in distinct cellular niches in bone marrow: HSCs
occupy a perivascular niche and early lymphoid progenitors occupy an endosteal
niche.

During navigation, grid cells increase their spike rates in firing fields
arranged on a markedly regular triangular lattice, whereas their spike timing is 
often modulated by theta oscillations. Oscillatory interference models of grid
cells predict theta amplitude modulations of membrane potential during firing
field traversals, whereas competing attractor network models predict slow
depolarizing ramps. Here, using in vivo whole-cell recordings, we tested these
models by directly measuring grid cell intracellular potentials in mice running
along linear tracks in virtual reality. Grid cells had large and reproducible
ramps of membrane potential depolarization that were the characteristic signature
tightly correlated with firing fields. Grid cells also demonstrated intracellular
theta oscillations that influenced their spike timing. However, the properties of
theta amplitude modulations were not consistent with the view that they determine
firing field locations. Our results support cellular and network mechanisms in
which grid fields are produced by slow ramps, as in attractor models, whereas
theta oscillations control spike timing.

Geological evidence suggests that marine ice extended to the Equator at least
twice during the Neoproterozoic era (about 750 to 635 million years ago),
inspiring the Snowball Earth hypothesis that the Earth was globally ice-covered. 
In a possible Snowball Earth climate, ocean circulation and mixing processes
would have set the melting and freezing rates that determine ice thickness, would
have influenced the survival of photosynthetic life, and may provide important
constraints for the interpretation of geochemical and sedimentological
observations. Here we show that in a Snowball Earth, the ocean would have been
well mixed and characterized by a dynamic circulation, with vigorous equatorial
meridional overturning circulation, zonal equatorial jets, a well developed eddy 
field, strong coastal upwelling and convective mixing. This is in contrast to the
sluggish ocean often expected in a Snowball Earth scenario owing to the
insulation of the ocean from atmospheric forcing by the thick ice cover. As a
result of vigorous convective mixing, the ocean temperature, salinity and density
were either uniform in the vertical direction or weakly stratified in a few
locations. Our results are based on a model that couples ice flow and ocean
circulation, and is driven by a weak geothermal heat flux under a global ice
cover about a kilometre thick. Compared with the modern ocean, the Snowball Earth
ocean had far larger vertical mixing rates, and comparable horizontal mixing by
ocean eddies. The strong circulation and coastal upwelling resulted in melting
rates near continents as much as ten times larger than previously estimated.
Although we cannot resolve the debate over the existence of global ice cover, we 
discuss the implications for the nutrient supply of photosynthetic activity and
for banded iron formations. Our insights and constraints on ocean dynamics may
help resolve the Snowball Earth controversy when combined with future geochemical
and geological observations.

In the era of precision cosmology, it is essential to determine the Hubble
constant to an accuracy of three per cent or better. At present, its uncertainty 
is dominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC), which, being our second-closest galaxy, serves as the best anchor point
for the cosmic distance scale. Observations of eclipsing binaries offer a unique 
opportunity to measure stellar parameters and distances precisely and accurately.
The eclipsing-binary method was previously applied to the LMC, but the accuracy
of the distance results was lessened by the need to model the bright, early-type 
systems used in those studies. Here we report determinations of the distances to 
eight long-period, late-type eclipsing systems in the LMC, composed of cool,
giant stars. For these systems, we can accurately measure both the linear and the
angular sizes of their components and avoid the most important problems related
to the hot, early-type systems. The LMC distance that we derive from these
systems (49.97 ± 0.19 (statistical) ± 1.11 (systematic) kiloparsecs) is accurate 
to 2.2 per cent and provides a firm base for a 3-per-cent determination of the
Hubble constant, with prospects for improvement to 2 per cent in the future.

Quantitative biomechanical models can identify control parameters that are used
during movements, and movement parameters that are encoded by premotor neurons.
We fit a mathematical dynamical systems model including subsyringeal pressure,
syringeal biomechanics and upper-vocal-tract filtering to the songs of zebra
finches. This reduces the dimensionality of singing dynamics, described as
trajectories (motor 'gestures') in a space of syringeal pressure and tension.
Here we assess model performance by characterizing the auditory response 'replay'
of song premotor HVC neurons to the presentation of song variants in sleeping
birds, and by examining HVC activity in singing birds. HVC projection neurons
were excited and interneurons were suppressed within a few milliseconds of the
extreme time points of the gesture trajectories. Thus, the HVC precisely encodes 
vocal motor output through activity at the times of extreme points of movement
trajectories. We propose that the sequential activity of HVC neurons is used as a
'forward' model, representing the sequence of gestures in song to make
predictions on expected behaviour and evaluate feedback.

The rapid cell turnover of the intestinal epithelium is achieved from small
numbers of stem cells located in the base of glandular crypts. These stem cells
have been variously described as rapidly cycling or quiescent. A functional
arrangement of stem cells that reconciles both of these behaviours has so far
been difficult to obtain. Alternative explanations for quiescent cells have been 
that they act as a parallel or reserve population that replace rapidly cycling
stem cells periodically or after injury; their exact nature remains unknown. Here
we show mouse intestinal quiescent cells to be precursors that are committed to
mature into differentiated secretory cells of the Paneth and enteroendocrine
lineage. However, crucially we find that after intestinal injury they are capable
of extensive proliferation and can give rise to clones comprising the main
epithelial cell types. Thus, quiescent cells can be recalled to the stem-cell
state. These findings establish quiescent cells as an effective clonogenic
reserve and provide a motivation for investigating their role in pathologies such
as colorectal cancers and intestinal inflammation.

The energy costs associated with the separation and purification of industrial
commodities, such as gases, fine chemicals and fresh water, currently represent
around 15 per cent of global energy production, and the demand for such
commodities is projected to triple by 2050 (ref. 1). The challenge of developing 
effective separation and purification technologies that have much smaller energy 
footprints is greater for carbon dioxide (CO2) than for other gases; in addition 
to its involvement in climate change, CO2 is an impurity in natural gas, biogas
(natural gas produced from biomass), syngas (CO/H2, the main source of hydrogen
in refineries) and many other gas streams. In the context of porous crystalline
materials that can exploit both equilibrium and kinetic selectivity, size
selectivity and targeted molecular recognition are attractive characteristics for
CO2 separation and capture, as exemplified by zeolites 5A and 13X (ref. 2), as
well as metal-organic materials (MOMs). Here we report that a crystal engineering
or reticular chemistry strategy that controls pore functionality and size in a
series of MOMs with coordinately saturated metal centres and periodically arrayed
hexafluorosilicate (SiF(2-)(6)) anions enables a 'sweet spot' of kinetics and
thermodynamics that offers high volumetric uptake at low CO2 partial pressure
(less than 0.15 bar). Most importantly, such MOMs offer an unprecedented CO2
sorption selectivity over N2, H2 and CH4, even in the presence of moisture. These
MOMs are therefore relevant to CO2 separation in the context of post-combustion
(flue gas, CO2/N2), pre-combustion (shifted synthesis gas stream, CO2/H2) and
natural gas upgrading (natural gas clean-up, CO2/CH4).

Hydrogen produced from renewable resources is a promising potential source of
clean energy. With the help of low-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel
cells, molecular hydrogen can be converted efficiently to produce electricity.
The implementation of sustainable hydrogen production and subsequent hydrogen
conversion to energy is called "hydrogen economy". Unfortunately, its physical
properties make the transport and handling of hydrogen gas difficult. To overcome
this, methanol can be used as a material for the storage of hydrogen, because it 
is a liquid at room temperature and contains 12.6 per cent hydrogen. However, the
state-of-the-art method for the production of hydrogen from methanol (methanol
reforming) is conducted at high temperatures (over 200 degrees Celsius) and high 
pressures (25-50 bar), which limits its potential applications. Here we describe 
an efficient low-temperature aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation process,
which is facilitated by ruthenium complexes. Hydrogen generation by this method
proceeds at 65-95 degrees Celsius and ambient pressure with excellent catalyst
turnover frequencies (4,700 per hour) and turnover numbers (exceeding 350,000).
This would make the delivery of hydrogen on mobile devices--and hence the use of 
methanol as a practical hydrogen carrier--feasible.

More than half of mammalian genes generate multiple messenger RNA isoforms that
differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and therefore in regulatory
sequences, often associated with cell proliferation and cancer; however, the
mechanisms coordinating alternative 3'-UTR processing for specific mRNA
populations remain poorly defined. Here we report that the cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element binding protein 1 (CPEB1), an RNA-binding protein that
regulates mRNA translation, also controls alternative 3'-UTR processing. CPEB1
shuttles to the nucleus, where it co-localizes with splicing factors and mediates
shortening of hundreds of mRNA 3' UTRs, thereby modulating their translation
efficiency in the cytoplasm. CPEB1-mediated 3'-UTR shortening correlates with
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. CPEB1 binding to pre-mRNAs not only directs
the use of alternative polyadenylation sites, but also changes alternative
splicing by preventing U2AF65 recruitment. Our results reveal a novel function of
CPEB1 in mediating alternative 3'-UTR processing, which is coordinated with
regulation of mRNA translation, through its dual nuclear and cytoplasmic
functions.

Ageing is the predominant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and contributes
to a significantly worse outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators of cardiovascular function 
and some miRNAs have key roles in ageing. We propose that altered expression of
miRNAs in the heart during ageing contributes to the age-dependent decline in
cardiac function. Here we show that miR-34a is induced in the ageing heart and
that in vivo silencing or genetic deletion of miR-34a reduces age-associated
cardiomyocyte cell death. Moreover, miR-34a inhibition reduces cell death and
fibrosis following acute myocardial infarction and improves recovery of
myocardial function. Mechanistically, we identified PNUTS (also known as PPP1R10)
as a novel direct miR-34a target, which reduces telomere shortening, DNA damage
responses and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and improves functional recovery after
acute myocardial infarction. Together, these results identify age-induced
expression of miR-34a and inhibition of its target PNUTS as a key mechanism that 
regulates cardiac contractile function during ageing and after acute myocardial
infarction, by inducing DNA damage responses and telomere attrition.

The species of the Strashilidae (strashilids) have been the most perplexing of
fossil insects from the Jurassic period of Russia and China. They have been
widely considered to be ectoparasites of pterosaurs or feathered dinosaurs, based
on the putative presence of piercing and sucking mouthparts and hind
tibio-basitarsal pincers purportedly used to fix onto the host's hairs or
feathers. Both the supposed host and parasite occur in the Daohugou beds from the
Middle Jurassic epoch of China (approximately 165 million years ago). Here we
analyse the morphology of strashilids from the Daohugou beds, and reach markedly 
different conclusions; namely that strashilids are highly specialized flies
(Diptera) bearing large membranous wings, with substantial sexual dimorphism of
the hind legs and abdominal extensions. The idea that they belong to an extinct
order is unsupported, and the lineage can be placed within the true flies. In
terms of major morphological and inferred behavioural features, strashilids
resemble the recent (extant) and relict members of the aquatic fly family
Nymphomyiidae. Their ontogeny are distinguished by the persistence in adult males
of larval abdominal respiratory gills, representing a unique case of
paedomorphism among endopterygote insects. Adult strashilids were probably
aquatic or amphibious, shedding their wings after emergence and mating in the
water.

Codon-usage bias has been observed in almost all genomes and is thought to result
from selection for efficient and accurate translation of highly expressed genes. 
Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA 
structure. Many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias, which is thought to
reflect a lack of selection for messenger RNA translation. Alternatively,
however, non-optimal codon usage may be of biological importance. The rhythmic
expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are 
essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in
Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading
frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular
circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ levels but,
unexpectedly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ 
phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian
feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is
essential for its circadian clock function. Our study provides an example of how 
non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve
optimal protein structure and function.

Circadian rhythms are oscillations in biological processes that function as a key
adaptation to the daily rhythms of most environments. In the model cyanobacterial
circadian clock system, the core oscillator proteins are encoded by the gene
cluster kaiABC. Genes with high expression and functional importance, such as the
kai genes, are usually encoded by optimal codons, yet the codon-usage bias of the
kaiBC genes is not optimized for translational efficiency. We discovered a
relationship between codon usage and a general property of circadian rhythms
called conditionality; namely, that endogenous rhythmicity is robustly expressed 
under some environmental conditions but not others. Despite the generality of
circadian conditionality, however, its molecular basis is unknown for any system.
Here we show that in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongate, non-optimal codon
usage was selected as a post-transcriptional mechanism to switch between
circadian and non-circadian regulation of gene expression as an adaptive response
to environmental conditions. When the kaiBC sequence was experimentally optimized
to enhance expression of the KaiB and KaiC proteins, intrinsic rhythmicity was
enhanced at cool temperatures that are experienced by this organism in its
natural habitat. However, fitness at those temperatures was highest in cells in
which the endogenous rhythms were suppressed at cool temperatures as compared
with cells exhibiting high-amplitude rhythmicity. These results indicate natural 
selection against circadian systems in cyanobacteria that are intrinsically
robust at cool temperatures. Modulation of circadian amplitude is therefore
crucial to its adaptive significance. Moreover, these results show the direct
effects of codon usage on a complex phenotype and organismal fitness. Our work
also challenges the long-standing view of directional selection towards optimal
codons, and provides a key example of natural selection against optimal codons to
achieve adaptive responses to environmental changes.

Post-transcriptional switches are flexible effectors of dynamic changes in gene
expression. Here we report a new post-transcriptional switch that dictates the
spatiotemporal and mutually exclusive expression of two alternative gene products
from a single transcript. Expression of primate-specific exonic microRNA-198
(miR-198), located in the 3'-untranslated region of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1)
messenger RNA, switches to expression of the linked open reading frame of FSTL1
upon wounding in a human ex vivo organ culture system. We show that binding of a 
KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP, also known as KHSRP) to the primary
transcript determines the fate of the transcript and is essential for the
processing of miR-198: transforming growth factor-β signalling switches off
miR-198 expression by downregulating KSRP, and promotes FSTL1 protein expression.
We also show that FSTL1 expression promotes keratinocyte migration, whereas
miR-198 expression has the opposite effect by targeting and inhibiting DIAPH1,
PLAU and LAMC2. A clear inverse correlation between the expression pattern of
FSTL1 (pro-migratory) and miR-198 (anti-migratory) highlights the importance of
this regulatory switch in controlling context-specific gene expression to
orchestrate wound re-epithelialization. The deleterious effect of failure of this
switch is apparent in non-healing chronic diabetic ulcers, in which expression of
miR-198 persists, FSTL1 is absent, and keratinocyte migration,
re-epithelialization and wound healing all fail to occur.

NFIB is a governor of epithelial-melanocyte stem cell behaviour in a shared
niche.

Adult stem cells reside in specialized niches where they receive environmental
cues to maintain tissue homeostasis. In mammals, the stem cell niche within hair 
follicles is home to epithelial hair follicle stem cells and melanocyte stem
cells, which sustain cyclical bouts of hair regeneration and pigmentation. To
generate pigmented hairs, synchrony is achieved such that upon initiation of a
new hair cycle, stem cells of each type activate lineage commitment. Dissecting
the inter-stem-cell crosstalk governing this intricate coordination has been
difficult, because mutations affecting one lineage often affect the other. Here
we identify transcription factor NFIB as an unanticipated coordinator of stem
cell behaviour. Hair follicle stem-cell-specific conditional targeting of Nfib in
mice uncouples stem cell synchrony. Remarkably, this happens not by perturbing
hair cycle and follicle architecture, but rather by promoting melanocyte stem
cell proliferation and differentiation. The early production of melanin is
restricted to melanocyte stem cells at the niche base. Melanocyte stem cells more
distant from the dermal papilla are unscathed, thereby preventing hair greying
typical of melanocyte stem cell differentiation mutants. Furthermore, we pinpoint
KIT-ligand as a dermal papilla signal promoting melanocyte stem cell
differentiation. Additionally, through chromatin-immunoprecipitation with
high-throughput-sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we identify endothelin 
2 (Edn2) as an NFIB target aberrantly activated in NFIB-deficient hair follicle
stem cells. Ectopically induced Edn2 recapitulates NFIB-deficient phenotypes in
wild-type mice. Conversely, endothelin receptor antagonists and/or KIT blocking
antibodies prevent precocious melanocyte stem cell differentiation in the
NFIB-deficient niche. Our findings reveal how melanocyte and hair follicle stem
cell behaviours maintain reliance upon cooperative factors within the niche, and 
how this can be uncoupled in injury, stress and disease states.

The exosome is the major 3'-5' RNA-degradation complex in eukaryotes. The
ubiquitous core of the yeast exosome (Exo-10) is formed by nine catalytically
inert subunits (Exo-9) and a single active RNase, Rrp44. In the nucleus, the
Exo-10 core recruits another nuclease, Rrp6. Here we crystallized an
approximately 440-kilodalton complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo-10 bound to 
a carboxy-terminal region of Rrp6 and to an RNA duplex with a 3'-overhang of 31
ribonucleotides. The 2.8 Å resolution structure shows how RNA is funnelled into
the Exo-9 channel in a single-stranded conformation by an unwinding pore. Rrp44
adopts a closed conformation and captures the RNA 3'-end that exits from the side
of Exo-9. Exo-9 subunits bind RNA with sequence-unspecific interactions
reminiscent of archaeal exosomes. The substrate binding and channelling
mechanisms of 3'-5' RNA degradation complexes are conserved in all kingdoms of
life.

Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an increased rate of change of
chromosome number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity. CIN is
observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and
drug resistance. Understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is therefore
paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and
increased DNA replication stress in CIN(+) colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative
to CIN(-) CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating
chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes 
(PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on
chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN(+) CRC.
Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the
adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA
replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome
missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate
replication-associated damage, reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation
errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and
DNA damage in CIN(+) cells. These data implicate a central role for replication
stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new
therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.

Bacteriophages (or phages) are the most abundant biological entities on earth,
and are estimated to outnumber their bacterial prey by tenfold. The constant
threat of phage predation has led to the evolution of a broad range of bacterial 
immunity mechanisms that in turn result in the evolution of diverse phage immune 
evasion strategies, leading to a dynamic co-evolutionary arms race. Although
bacterial innate immune mechanisms against phage abound, the only documented
bacterial adaptive immune system is the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins) system, which
provides sequence-specific protection from invading nucleic acids, including
phage. Here we show a remarkable turn of events, in which a phage-encoded
CRISPR/Cas system is used to counteract a phage inhibitory chromosomal island of 
the bacterial host. A successful lytic infection by the phage is dependent on
sequence identity between CRISPR spacers and the target chromosomal island. In
the absence of such targeting, the phage-encoded CRISPR/Cas system can acquire
new spacers to evolve rapidly and ensure effective targeting of the chromosomal
island to restore phage replication.

GLI activation by atypical protein kinase C ι/λ regulates the growth of basal
cell carcinomas.

Growth of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) requires high levels of hedgehog (HH)
signalling through the transcription factor GLI. Although inhibitors of membrane 
protein smoothened (SMO) effectively suppress HH signalling, early tumour
resistance illustrates the need for additional downstream targets for therapy.
Here we identify atypical protein kinase C ι/λ (aPKC-ι/λ) as a novel GLI
regulator in mammals. aPKC-ι/λ and its polarity signalling partners co-localize
at the centrosome and form a complex with missing-in-metastasis (MIM), a
scaffolding protein that potentiates HH signalling. Genetic or pharmacological
loss of aPKC-ι/λ function blocks HH signalling and proliferation of BCC cells.
Prkci is a HH target gene that forms a positive feedback loop with GLI and exists
at increased levels in BCCs. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that
aPKC-ι/λ and SMO control the expression of similar genes in tumour cells.
aPKC-ι/λ functions downstream of SMO to phosphorylate and activate GLI1,
resulting in maximal DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Activated
aPKC-ι/λ is upregulated in SMO-inhibitor-resistant tumours and targeting aPKC-ι/λ
suppresses signalling and growth of resistant BCC cell lines. These results
demonstrate that aPKC-ι/λ is critical for HH-dependent processes and implicates
aPKC-ι/λ as a new, tumour-selective therapeutic target for the treatment of
SMO-inhibitor-resistant cancers.

Biologists have long been concerned about what constrains variation in cell size,
but progress in this field has been slow and stymied by experimental limitations.
Here we describe a new method, ergodic rate analysis (ERA), that uses single-cell
measurements of fixed steady-state populations to accurately infer the rates of
molecular events, including rates of cell growth. ERA exploits the fact that the 
number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time
through that state. With this method, it is possible to calculate full time
trajectories of any feature that can be labelled in fixed cells, for example
levels of phosphoproteins or total cellular mass. Using ERA we find evidence for 
a size-discriminatory process at the G1/S transition that acts to decrease
cell-to-cell size variation.

Specialized appendages in fuxianhuiids and the head organization of early
euarthropods.

The organization of the head provides critical data for resolving the
phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of extinct and extant
euarthropods. The early Cambrian-period fuxianhuiids are regarded as basal
representatives of stem-group Euarthropoda, and their anterior morphology
therefore offers key insights for reconstructing the ancestral condition of the
euarthropod head. However, the paired post-antennal structures in Fuxianhuia
protensa remain controversial; they have been interpreted as both 'great
appendages' and as gut diverticulae. Here we describe Chengjiangocaris
kunmingensis sp. nov. and Fuxianhuia xiaoshibaensis sp. nov. from a new early
Cambrian (Stage 3) fossil Lagerstätte in Yunnan, China. Numerous specimens of
both species show a unique 'taphonomic dissection' of the anterodorsal head
shield, revealing the cephalic organization in detail. We demonstrate the
presence of a pair of specialized post-antennal appendages (SPAs) in the
fuxianhuiid head, which attach at either side of the posteriorly directed mouth, 
behind the hypostome. Preserved functional articulations indicate a well-defined 
but restricted range of limb movement, suggestive of a simple type of sweep
feeding. The organization of the SPAs in fuxianhuiids is incompatible with the
(deutocerebral) anterior raptorial appendages of megacheirans, and argue against 
the presence of protocerebral limbs in the fuxianhuiids. The positions of the
fuxianhuiid antennae and SPAs indicate that they are segmentally homologous to
the deutocerebral and tritocerebral appendages of crown-group Euarthropoda
respectively. These findings indicate that antenniform deutocerebral appendages
with many podomeres are a plesiomorphic feature of the ancestral euarthropod
head.

New models of fluid transport are expected to emerge from the confinement of
liquids at the nanoscale, with potential applications in ultrafiltration,
desalination and energy conversion. Nevertheless, advancing our fundamental
understanding of fluid transport on the smallest scales requires mass and ion
dynamics to be ultimately characterized across an individual channel to avoid
averaging over many pores. A major challenge for nanofluidics thus lies in
building distinct and well-controlled nanochannels, amenable to the systematic
exploration of their properties. Here we describe the fabrication and use of a
hierarchical nanofluidic device made of a boron nitride nanotube that pierces an 
ultrathin membrane and connects two fluid reservoirs. Such a transmembrane
geometry allows the detailed study of fluidic transport through a single nanotube
under diverse forces, including electric fields, pressure drops and chemical
gradients. Using this device, we discover very large, osmotically induced
electric currents generated by salinity gradients, exceeding by two orders of
magnitude their pressure-driven counterpart. We show that this result originates 
in the anomalously high surface charge carried by the nanotube's internal surface
in water at large pH, which we independently quantify in conductance
measurements. The nano-assembly route using nanostructures as building blocks
opens the way to studying fluid, ionic and molecule transport on the nanoscale,
and may lead to biomimetic functionalities. Our results furthermore suggest that 
boron nitride nanotubes could be used as membranes for osmotic power harvesting
under salinity gradients.

Broad X-ray emission lines from neutral and partially ionized iron observed in
active galaxies have been interpreted as fluorescence produced by the reflection 
of hard X-rays off the inner edge of an accretion disk. In this model, line
broadening and distortion result from rapid rotation and relativistic effects
near the black hole, the line shape being sensitive to its spin. Alternative
models in which the distortions result from absorption by intervening structures 
provide an equally good description of the data, and there has been no general
agreement on which is correct. Recent claims that the black hole (2 × 10(6) solar
masses) at the centre of the galaxy NGC 1365 is rotating at close to its maximum 
possible speed rest on the assumption of relativistic reflection. Here we report 
X-ray observations of NGC 1365 that reveal the relativistic disk features through
broadened Fe-line emission and an associated Compton scattering excess of 10-30
kiloelectronvolts. Using temporal and spectral analyses, we disentangle continuum
changes due to time-variable absorption from reflection, which we find arises
from a region within 2.5 gravitational radii of the rapidly spinning black hole. 
Absorption-dominated models that do not include relativistic disk reflection can 
be ruled out both statistically and on physical grounds.

China is experiencing intense air pollution caused in large part by anthropogenic
emissions of reactive nitrogen. These emissions result in the deposition of
atmospheric nitrogen (N) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with implications
for human and ecosystem health, greenhouse gas balances and biological diversity.
However, information on the magnitude and environmental impact of N deposition in
China is limited. Here we use nationwide data sets on bulk N deposition, plant
foliar N and crop N uptake (from long-term unfertilized soils) to evaluate N
deposition dynamics and their effect on ecosystems across China between 1980 and 
2010. We find that the average annual bulk deposition of N increased by
approximately 8 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare (P < 0.001) between the 1980s
(13.2 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare) and the 2000s (21.1 kilograms of
nitrogen per hectare). Nitrogen deposition rates in the industrialized and
agriculturally intensified regions of China are as high as the peak levels of
deposition in northwestern Europe in the 1980s, before the introduction of
mitigation measures. Nitrogen from ammonium (NH4(+)) is the dominant form of N in
bulk deposition, but the rate of increase is largest for deposition of N from
nitrate (NO3(-)), in agreement with decreased ratios of NH3 to NOx emissions
since 1980. We also find that the impact of N deposition on Chinese ecosystems
includes significantly increased plant foliar N concentrations in natural and
semi-natural (that is, non-agricultural) ecosystems and increased crop N uptake
from long-term-unfertilized croplands. China and other economies are facing a
continuing challenge to reduce emissions of reactive nitrogen, N deposition and
their negative effects on human health and the environment.

Schistosomiasis is among the most prevalent human parasitic diseases, affecting
more than 200 million people worldwide. The aetiological agents of this disease
are trematode flatworms (Schistosoma) that live and lay eggs within the
vasculature of the host. These eggs lodge in host tissues, causing inflammatory
responses that are the primary cause of morbidity. Because these parasites can
live and reproduce within human hosts for decades, elucidating the mechanisms
that promote their longevity is of fundamental importance. Although adult
pluripotent stem cells, called neoblasts, drive long-term homeostatic tissue
maintenance in long-lived free-living flatworms (for example, planarians), and
neoblast-like cells have been described in some parasitic tapeworms, little is
known about whether similar cell types exist in any trematode species. Here we
describe a population of neoblast-like cells in the trematode Schistosoma
mansoni. These cells resemble planarian neoblasts morphologically and share their
ability to proliferate and differentiate into derivatives of multiple germ
layers. Capitalizing on available genomic resources and RNA-seq-based gene
expression profiling, we find that these schistosome neoblast-like cells express 
a fibroblast growth factor receptor orthologue. Using RNA interference we
demonstrate that this gene is required for the maintenance of these neoblast-like
cells. Our observations indicate that adaptation of developmental strategies
shared by free-living ancestors to modern-day schistosomes probably contributed
to the success of these animals as long-lived obligate parasites. We expect that 
future studies deciphering the function of these neoblast-like cells will have
important implications for understanding the biology of these devastating
parasites.

Since the discovery of the first exoplanets, it has been known that other
planetary systems can look quite unlike our own. Until fairly recently, we have
been able to probe only the upper range of the planet size distribution, and,
since last year, to detect planets that are the size of Earth or somewhat
smaller. Hitherto, no planets have been found that are smaller than those we see 
in the Solar System. Here we report a planet significantly smaller than Mercury. 
This tiny planet is the innermost of three that orbit the Sun-like host star,
which we have designated Kepler-37. Owing to its extremely small size, similar to
that of the Moon, and highly irradiated surface, the planet, Kepler-37b, is
probably rocky with no atmosphere or water, similar to Mercury.

Recent advances in genomic research have revealed the existence of a large number
of transcripts devoid of protein-coding potential in multiple organisms. Although
the functional role for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been best defined in
epigenetic phenomena such as X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting, different 
classes of lncRNAs may have varied biological functions. We and others have
identified a class of lncRNAs, termed ncRNA-activating (ncRNA-a), that function
to activate their neighbouring genes using a cis-mediated mechanism. To define
the precise mode by which such enhancer-like RNAs function, we depleted factors
with known roles in transcriptional activation and assessed their role in
RNA-dependent activation. Here we report that depletion of the components of the 
co-activator complex, Mediator, specifically and potently diminished the
ncRNA-induced activation of transcription in a heterologous reporter assay using 
human HEK293 cells. In vivo, Mediator is recruited to ncRNA-a target genes and
regulates their expression. We show that ncRNA-a interact with Mediator to
regulate its chromatin localization and kinase activity towards histone H3 serine
10. The Mediator complex harbouring disease- displays diminished ability to
associate with activating ncRNAs. Chromosome conformation capture confirmed the
presence of DNA looping between the ncRNA-a loci and its targets. Importantly,
depletion of Mediator subunits or ncRNA-a reduced the chromatin looping between
the two loci. Our results identify the human Mediator complex as the transducer
of activating ncRNAs and highlight the importance of Mediator and activating
ncRNA association in human disease.

Crystal structure of the entire respiratory complex I.

Building, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.

Complex I is the first and largest enzyme of the respiratory chain and has a
central role in cellular energy production through the coupling of
NADH:ubiquinone electron transfer to proton translocation. It is also implicated 
in many common human neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the first
crystal structure of the entire, intact complex I (from Thermus thermophilus) at 
3.3 Å resolution. The structure of the 536-kDa complex comprises 16 different
subunits, with a total of 64 transmembrane helices and 9 iron-sulphur clusters.
The core fold of subunit Nqo8 (ND1 in humans) is, unexpectedly, similar to a
half-channel of the antiporter-like subunits. Small subunits nearby form a linked
second half-channel, which completes the fourth proton-translocation pathway
(present in addition to the channels in three antiporter-like subunits). The
quinone-binding site is unusually long, narrow and enclosed. The quinone
headgroup binds at the deep end of this chamber, near iron-sulphur cluster N2.
Notably, the chamber is linked to the fourth channel by a 'funnel' of charged
residues. The link continues over the entire membrane domain as a flexible
central axis of charged and polar residues, and probably has a leading role in
the propagation of conformational changes, aided by coupling elements. The
structure suggests that a unique, out-of-the-membrane quinone-reaction chamber
enables the redox energy to drive concerted long-range conformational changes in 
the four antiporter-like domains, resulting in translocation of four protons per 
cycle.

High salt recruits aversive taste pathways.

In the tongue, distinct classes of taste receptor cells detect the five basic
tastes; sweet, sour, bitter, sodium salt and umami. Among these qualities, bitter
and sour stimuli are innately aversive, whereas sweet and umami are appetitive
and generally attractive to animals. By contrast, salty taste is unique in that
increasing salt concentration fundamentally transforms an innately appetitive
stimulus into a powerfully aversive one. This appetitive-aversive balance helps
to maintain appropriate salt consumption, and represents an important part of
fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We have shown previously that the appetitive
responses to NaCl are mediated by taste receptor cells expressing the epithelial 
sodium channel, ENaC, but the cellular substrate for salt aversion was unknown.
Here we examine the cellular and molecular basis for the rejection of high
concentrations of salts. We show that high salt recruits the two primary aversive
taste pathways by activating the sour- and bitter-taste-sensing cells. We also
demonstrate that genetic silencing of these pathways abolishes behavioural
aversion to concentrated salt, without impairing salt attraction. Notably, mice
devoid of salt-aversion pathways show unimpeded, continuous attraction even to
very high concentrations of NaCl. We propose that the 'co-opting' of sour and
bitter neural pathways evolved as a means to ensure that high levels of salt
reliably trigger robust behavioural rejection, thus preventing its potentially
detrimental effects on health.

Evolutionary rescue from extinction is contingent on a lower rate of
environmental change.

University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.

The extinction rate of populations is predicted to rise under increasing rates of
environmental change. If a population experiencing increasingly stressful
conditions lacks appropriate phenotypic plasticity or access to more suitable
habitats, then genetic change may be the only way to avoid extinction.
Evolutionary rescue from extinction occurs when natural selection enriches a
population for more stress-tolerant genetic variants. Some experimental studies
have shown that lower rates of environmental change lead to more adapted
populations or fewer extinctions. However, there has been little focus on the
genetic changes that underlie evolutionary rescue. Here we demonstrate that some 
evolutionary trajectories are contingent on a lower rate of environmental change.
We allowed hundreds of populations of Escherichia coli to evolve under variable
rates of increase in concentration of the antibiotic rifampicin. We then
genetically engineered all combinations of mutations from isolates evolved under 
lower rates of environmental change. By assessing fitness of these engineered
strains across a range of drug concentrations, we show that certain genotypes are
evolutionarily inaccessible under rapid environmental change. Rapidly
deteriorating environments not only limit mutational opportunities by lowering
population size, but they can also eliminate sets of mutations as evolutionary
options. As anthropogenic activities are leading to environmental change at
unprecedented rapidity, it is critical to understand how the rate of
environmental change affects both demographic and genetic underpinnings of
evolutionary rescue.

A two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated chromosome-end protection.

Mammalian telomeres repress DNA-damage activation at natural chromosome ends by
recruiting specific inhibitors of the DNA-damage machinery that form a protective
complex termed shelterin. Within this complex, TRF2 (also known as TERF2) has a
crucial role in end protection through the suppression of ATM activation and the 
formation of end-to-end chromosome fusions. Here we address the molecular
properties of TRF2 that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome
ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our data support a two-step mechanism for
TRF2-mediated end protection. First, the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required 
to inhibit ATM activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a
DNA-damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the propagation of
DNA-damage signalling downstream of ATM activation. This novel modulation of the 
DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (ref. 3). 
Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and 
the ubiquitin ligase UBR5, and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end
fusions. This two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection helps to
explain the apparent paradox of frequent localization of DDR proteins at
functional telomeres without concurrent induction of detrimental DNA-repair
activities.

Pathogens often infect hosts through collective actions: they secrete
growth-promoting compounds or virulence factors, or evoke host reactions that
fuel the colonization of the host. Such behaviours are vulnerable to the rise of 
mutants that benefit from the collective action without contributing to it; how
these behaviours can be evolutionarily stable is not well understood. We address 
this question using the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium (hereafter termed S. typhimurium), which manipulates its host to
induce inflammation, and thereby outcompetes the commensal microbiota. Notably,
the virulence factors needed for host manipulation are expressed in a bistable
fashion, leading to a slow-growing subpopulation that expresses virulence genes, 
and a fast-growing subpopulation that is phenotypically avirulent. Here we show
that the expression of the genetically identical but phenotypically avirulent
subpopulation is essential for the evolutionary stability of virulence in this
pathogen. Using a combination of mathematical modelling, experimental evolution
and competition experiments we found that within-host evolution leads to the
emergence of mutants that are genetically avirulent and fast-growing. These
mutants are defectors that exploit inflammation without contributing to it. In
infection experiments initiated with wild-type S. typhimurium, defectors increase
only slowly in frequency. In a genetically modified S. typhimurium strain in
which the phenotypically avirulent subpopulation is reduced in size, defectors
rise more rapidly, inflammation ceases prematurely, and S. typhimurium is quickly
cleared from the gut. Our results establish that host manipulation by S.
typhimurium is a cooperative trait that is vulnerable to the rise of avirulent
defectors; the expression of a phenotypically avirulent subpopulation that grows 
as fast as defectors slows down this process, and thereby promotes the
evolutionary stability of virulence. This points to a key role of bistable
virulence gene expression in stabilizing cooperative virulence and may lead the
way to new approaches for controlling pathogens.

Generation of electron Airy beams.

Within the framework of quantum mechanics, a unique particle wave packet exists
in the form of the Airy function. Its counterintuitive properties are revealed as
it propagates in time or space: the quantum probability wave packet preserves its
shape despite dispersion or diffraction and propagates along a parabolic caustic 
trajectory, even though no force is applied. This does not contradict Newton's
laws of motion, because the wave packet centroid propagates along a straight
line. Nearly 30 years later, this wave packet, known as an accelerating Airy
beam, was realized in the optical domain; later it was generalized to an
orthogonal and complete family of beams that propagate along parabolic
trajectories, as well as to beams that propagate along arbitrary convex
trajectories. Here we report the experimental generation and observation of the
Airy beams of free electrons. These electron Airy beams were generated by
diffraction of electrons through a nanoscale hologram, which imprinted on the
electrons' wavefunction a cubic phase modulation in the transverse plane. The
highest-intensity lobes of the generated beams indeed followed parabolic
trajectories. We directly observed a non-spreading electron wavefunction that
self-heals, restoring its original shape after passing an obstacle. This
holographic generation of electron Airy beams opens up new avenues for steering
electronic wave packets like their photonic counterparts, because the wave
packets can be imprinted with arbitrary shapes or trajectories.

Several reports proposed that the extraordinary dominance of the SAR11 bacterial 
clade in ocean ecosystems could be a consequence of unusual mechanisms of
resistance to bacteriophage infection, including 'cryptic escape' through reduced
cell size and/or K-strategist defence specialism. Alternatively, the evolution of
high surface-to-volume ratios coupled with minimal genomes containing
high-affinity transporters enables unusually efficient metabolism for oxidizing
dissolved organic matter in the world's oceans that could support vast population
sizes despite phage susceptibility. These ideas are important for understanding
plankton ecology because they emphasize the potentially important role of
top-down mechanisms in predation, thus determining the size of SAR11 populations 
and their concomitant role in biogeochemical cycling. Here we report the
isolation of diverse SAR11 viruses belonging to two virus families in culture,
for which we propose the name 'pelagiphage', after their host. Notably, the
pelagiphage genomes were highly represented in marine viral metagenomes,
demonstrating their importance in nature. One of the new phages, HTVC010P,
represents a new podovirus subfamily more abundant than any seen previously, in
all data sets tested, and may represent one of the most abundant virus
subfamilies in the biosphere. This discovery disproves the theory that SAR11
cells are immune to viral predation and is consistent with the interpretation
that the success of this highly abundant microbial clade is the result of
successfully evolved adaptation to resource competition.

Sex pheromones play a pivotal role in the communication of many sexually
reproducing organisms. Accordingly, speciation is often accompanied by pheromone 
diversification enabling proper mate finding and recognition. Current theory
implies that chemical signals are under stabilizing selection by the receivers
who thereby maintain the integrity of the signals. How the tremendous diversity
of sex pheromones seen today evolved is poorly understood. Here we unravel the
genetics of a newly evolved pheromone phenotype in wasps and present results from
behavioural experiments indicating how the evolution of a new pheromone component
occurred in an established sender-receiver system. We show that male Nasonia
vitripennis evolved an additional pheromone compound differing only in its
stereochemistry from a pre-existing one. Comparative behavioural studies show
that conspecific females responded neutrally to the new pheromone phenotype when 
it evolved. Genetic mapping and gene knockdown show that a cluster of three
closely linked genes accounts for the ability to produce this new pheromone
phenotype. Our data suggest that new pheromone compounds can persist in a
sender's population, without being selected against by the receiver and without
the receiver having a pre-existing preference for the new pheromone phenotype, by
initially remaining unperceived. Our results thus contribute valuable new
insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the diversification of sex
pheromones. Furthermore, they indicate that the genetic basis of new pheromone
compounds can be simple, allowing them to persist long enough in a population for
receivers to evolve chemosensory adaptations for their exploitation.

Ribosomes, the protein factories of living cells, translate genetic information
carried by messenger RNAs into proteins, and are thus involved in virtually all
aspects of cellular development and maintenance. The few available structures of 
the eukaryotic ribosome reveal that it is more complex than its prokaryotic
counterpart, owing mainly to the presence of eukaryote-specific ribosomal
proteins and additional ribosomal RNA insertions, called expansion segments. The 
structures also differ among species, partly in the size and arrangement of these
expansion segments. Such differences are extreme in kinetoplastids, unicellular
eukaryotic parasites often infectious to humans. Here we present a
high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the ribosome of Trypanosoma
brucei, the parasite that is transmitted by the tsetse fly and that causes
African sleeping sickness. The atomic model reveals the unique features of this
ribosome, characterized mainly by the presence of unusually large expansion
segments and ribosomal-protein extensions leading to the formation of four
additional inter-subunit bridges. We also find additional rRNA insertions,
including one large rRNA domain that is not found in other eukaryotes.
Furthermore, the structure reveals the five cleavage sites of the kinetoplastid
large ribosomal subunit (LSU) rRNA chain, which is known to be cleaved uniquely
into six pieces, and suggests that the cleavage is important for the maintenance 
of the T. brucei ribosome in the observed structure. We discuss several possible 
implications of the large rRNA expansion segments for the translation-regulation 
process. The structure could serve as a basis for future experiments aimed at
understanding the functional importance of these kinetoplastid-specific ribosomal
features in protein-translation regulation, an essential step towards finding
effective and safe kinetoplastid-specific drugs.

Methanotrophs consume methane as their major carbon source and have an essential 
role in the global carbon cycle by limiting escape of this greenhouse gas to the 
atmosphere. These bacteria oxidize methane to methanol by soluble and particulate
methane monooxygenases (MMOs). Soluble MMO contains three protein components, a
251-kilodalton hydroxylase (MMOH), a 38.6-kilodalton reductase (MMOR), and a
15.9-kilodalton regulatory protein (MMOB), required to couple electron
consumption with substrate hydroxylation at the catalytic diiron centre of MMOH. 
Until now, the role of MMOB has remained ambiguous owing to a lack of
atomic-level information about the MMOH-MMOB (hereafter termed H-B) complex. Here
we remedy this deficiency by providing a crystal structure of H-B, which reveals 
the manner by which MMOB controls the conformation of residues in MMOH crucial
for substrate access to the active site. MMOB docks at the α(2)β(2) interface of 
α(2)β(2)γ(2) MMOH, and triggers simultaneous conformational changes in the
α-subunit that modulate oxygen and methane access as well as proton delivery to
the diiron centre. Without such careful control by MMOB of these substrate routes
to the diiron active site, the enzyme operates as an NADH oxidase rather than a
monooxygenase. Biological catalysis involving small substrates is often
accomplished in nature by large proteins and protein complexes. The structure
presented in this work provides an elegant example of this principle.

The release of carbon from tropical forests may exacerbate future climate change,
but the magnitude of the effect in climate models remains uncertain. Coupled
climate-carbon-cycle models generally agree that carbon storage on land will
increase as a result of the simultaneous enhancement of plant photosynthesis and 
water use efficiency under higher atmospheric CO(2) concentrations, but will
decrease owing to higher soil and plant respiration rates associated with warming
temperatures. At present, the balance between these effects varies markedly among
coupled climate-carbon-cycle models, leading to a range of 330 gigatonnes in the 
projected change in the amount of carbon stored on tropical land by 2100.
Explanations for this large uncertainty include differences in the predicted
change in rainfall in Amazonia and variations in the responses of alternative
vegetation models to warming. Here we identify an emergent linear relationship,
across an ensemble of models, between the sensitivity of tropical land carbon
storage to warming and the sensitivity of the annual growth rate of atmospheric
CO(2) to tropical temperature anomalies. Combined with contemporary observations 
of atmospheric CO(2) concentration and tropical temperature, this relationship
provides a tight constraint on the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate
change. We estimate that over tropical land from latitude 30° north to 30° south,
warming alone will release 53 ± 17 gigatonnes of carbon per kelvin. Compared with
the unconstrained ensemble of climate-carbon-cycle projections, this indicates a 
much lower risk of Amazon forest dieback under CO(2)-induced climate change if
CO(2) fertilization effects are as large as suggested by current models. Our
study, however, also implies greater certainty that carbon will be lost from
tropical land if warming arises from reductions in aerosols or increases in other
greenhouse gases.

Several mutations are required for cancer development, and genome sequencing has 
revealed that many cancers, including breast cancer, have somatic mutation
spectra dominated by C-to-T transitions. Most of these mutations occur at
hydrolytically disfavoured non-methylated cytosines throughout the genome, and
are sometimes clustered. Here we show that the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B is
a probable source of these mutations. APOBEC3B messenger RNA is upregulated in
most primary breast tumours and breast cancer cell lines. Tumours that express
high levels of APOBEC3B have twice as many mutations as those that express low
levels and are more likely to have mutations in TP53. Endogenous APOBEC3B protein
is predominantly nuclear and the only detectable source of DNA C-to-U editing
activity in breast cancer cell-line extracts. Knockdown experiments show that
endogenous APOBEC3B correlates with increased levels of genomic uracil, increased
mutation frequencies, and C-to-T transitions. Furthermore, induced APOBEC3B
overexpression causes cell cycle deviations, cell death, DNA fragmentation,
γ-H2AX accumulation and C-to-T mutations. Our data suggest a model in which
APOBEC3B-catalysed deamination provides a chronic source of DNA damage in breast 
cancers that could select TP53 inactivation and explain how some tumours evolve
rapidly and manifest heterogeneity.

Blood production is ensured by rare, self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs). How HSCs accommodate the diverse cellular stresses associated with their 
life-long activity remains elusive. Here we identify autophagy as an essential
mechanism protecting HSCs from metabolic stress. We show that mouse HSCs, in
contrast to their short-lived myeloid progeny, robustly induce autophagy after ex
vivo cytokine withdrawal and in vivo calorie restriction. We demonstrate that
FOXO3A is critical to maintain a gene expression program that poises HSCs for
rapid induction of autophagy upon starvation. Notably, we find that old HSCs
retain an intact FOXO3A-driven pro-autophagy gene program, and that ongoing
autophagy is needed to mitigate an energy crisis and allow their survival. Our
results demonstrate that autophagy is essential for the life-long maintenance of 
the HSC compartment and for supporting an old, failing blood system.

Cancer control by adaptive immunity involves a number of defined death and
clearance mechanisms. However, efficient inhibition of exponential cancer growth 
by T cells and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) requires additional undefined mechanisms that
arrest cancer cell proliferation. Here we show that the combined action of the
T-helper-1-cell cytokines IFN-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) directly induces
permanent growth arrest in cancers. To safely separate senescence induced by
tumour immunity from oncogene-induced senescence, we used a mouse model in which 
the Simian virus 40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed under the control of the rat 
insulin promoter creates tumours by attenuating p53- and Rb-mediated cell cycle
control. When combined, IFN-γ and TNF drive Tag-expressing cancers into
senescence by inducing permanent growth arrest in G1/G0, activation of p16INK4a
(also known as CDKN2A), and downstream Rb hypophosphorylation at serine 795. This
cytokine-induced senescence strictly requires STAT1 and TNFR1 (also known as
TNFRSF1A) signalling in addition to p16INK4a. In vivo, Tag-specific T-helper 1
cells permanently arrest Tag-expressing cancers by inducing IFN-γ- and
TNFR1-dependent senescence. Conversely, Tnfr1(-/-)Tag-expressing cancers resist
cytokine-induced senescence and grow aggressively, even in TNFR1-expressing
hosts. Finally, as IFN-γ and TNF induce senescence in numerous murine and human
cancers, this may be a general mechanism for arresting cancer progression.

The masses of the supermassive black holes found in galaxy bulges are correlated 
with a multitude of galaxy properties, leading to suggestions that galaxies and
black holes may evolve together. The number of reliably measured black-hole
masses is small, and the number of methods for measuring them is limited, holding
back attempts to understand this co-evolution. Directly measuring black-hole
masses is currently possible with stellar kinematics (in early-type galaxies),
ionized-gas kinematics (in some spiral and early-type galaxies) and in rare
objects that have central maser emission. Here we report that by modelling the
effect of a black hole on the kinematics of molecular gas it is possible to fit
interferometric observations of CO emission and thereby accurately estimate
black-hole masses. We study the dynamics of the gas in the early-type galaxy
NGC 4526, and obtain a best fit that requires the presence of a central dark
object of 4.5(+4.2)(-3.1) × 10(8) solar masses (3σ confidence limit). With the
next-generation millimetre-wavelength interferometers these observations could be
reproduced in galaxies out to 75 megaparsecs in less than 5 hours of observing
time. The use of molecular gas as a kinematic tracer should thus allow one to
estimate black-hole masses in hundreds of galaxies in the local Universe, many
more than are accessible with current techniques.

Recent studies suggest that electrides--ionic crystals in which electrons serve
as anions--are not exceptional materials but rather a generalized form,
particularly under high pressure. The topology of the cavities confining anionic 
electrons determines their physical properties. At present, reported confining
sites consist only of zero-dimensional cavities or weakly linked channels. Here
we report a layered-structure electride of dicalcium nitride, Ca(2)N, which
possesses two-dimensionally confined anionic electrons whose concentration agrees
well with that for the chemical formula of [Ca(2)N](+)·e(-). Two-dimensional
transport characteristics are demonstrated by a high electron mobility
(520 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1)) and long mean scattering time (0.6 picoseconds) with a
mean free path of 0.12 micrometres. The quadratic temperature dependence of the
resistivity up to 120 Kelvin indicates the presence of an electron-electron
interaction. A striking anisotropic magnetoresistance behaviour with respect to
the direction of magnetic field (negative for the field perpendicular to the
conducting plane and positive for the field parallel to it) is observed,
confirming diffusive two-dimensional transport in dense electron layers.
Additionally, band calculations support confinement of anionic electrons within
the interlayer space, and photoemission measurements confirm anisotropic low work
functions of 3.5 and 2.6 electronvolts, revealing the loosely bound nature of the
anionic electrons. We conclude that Ca(2)N is a two-dimensional electride in
terms of [Ca(2)N](+)·e(-).

Insulin resistance is a fundamental pathogenic factor present in various
metabolic disorders including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although skeletal
muscle accounts for 70-90% of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, the mechanism 
underlying muscle insulin resistance is poorly understood. Here we show in mice
that muscle-specific mitsugumin 53 (MG53; also called TRIM72) mediates the
degradation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and 
when upregulated, causes metabolic syndrome featuring insulin resistance,
obesity, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. MG53 expression is markedly elevated in 
models of insulin resistance, and MG53 overexpression suffices to trigger muscle 
insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome sequentially. Conversely, ablation of
MG53 prevents diet-induced metabolic syndrome by preserving the insulin receptor,
IRS1 and insulin signalling integrity. Mechanistically, MG53 acts as an E3 ligase
targeting the insulin receptor and IRS1 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation,
comprising a central mechanism controlling insulin signal strength in skeletal
muscle. These findings define MG53 as a novel therapeutic target for treating
metabolic disorders and associated cardiovascular complications.

The non-canonical NF-κB pathway forms a major arm of NF-κB signalling that
mediates important biological functions, including lymphoid organogenesis,
B-lymphocyte function, and cell growth and survival. Activation of the
non-canonical NF-κB pathway involves degradation of an inhibitory protein, TNF
receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), but how this signalling event is controlled
is still unknown. Here we have identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a pivotal 
regulator of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. OTUD7B deficiency in mice has no
appreciable effect on canonical NF-κB activation but causes hyperactivation of
non-canonical NF-κB. In response to non-canonical NF-κB stimuli, OTUD7B binds and
deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and preventing
aberrant non-canonical NF-κB activation. Consequently, the OTUD7B deficiency
results in B-cell hyper-responsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular
hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defence ability against
an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. These findings establish
OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced non-canonical NF-κB activation
and indicate a mechanism of immune regulation that involves OTUD7B-mediated
deubiquitination and stabilization of TRAF3.

Climate change is predicted to increase both drought frequency and duration, and 
when coupled with substantial warming, will establish a new hydroclimatological
model for many regions. Large-scale, warm droughts have recently occurred in
North America, Africa, Europe, Amazonia and Australia, resulting in major effects
on terrestrial ecosystems, carbon balance and food security. Here we compare the 
functional response of above-ground net primary production to contrasting
hydroclimatic periods in the late twentieth century (1975-1998), and drier,
warmer conditions in the early twenty-first century (2000-2009) in the Northern
and Southern Hemispheres. We find a common ecosystem water-use efficiency
(WUE(e): above-ground net primary production/evapotranspiration) across biomes
ranging from grassland to forest that indicates an intrinsic system sensitivity
to water availability across rainfall regimes, regardless of hydroclimatic
conditions. We found higher WUE(e) in drier years that increased significantly
with drought to a maximum WUE(e) across all biomes; and a minimum native state in
wetter years that was common across hydroclimatic periods. This indicates
biome-scale resilience to the interannual variability associated with the early
twenty-first century drought--that is, the capacity to tolerate low, annual
precipitation and to respond to subsequent periods of favourable water balance.
These findings provide a conceptual model of ecosystem properties at the decadal 
scale applicable to the widespread altered hydroclimatic conditions that are
predicted for later this century. Understanding the hydroclimatic threshold that 
will break down ecosystem resilience and alter maximum WUE(e) may allow us to
predict land-surface consequences as large regions become more arid, starting
with water-limited, low-productivity grasslands.

Biodiversity decreases disease through predictable changes in host community

Accelerating rates of species extinctions and disease emergence underscore the
importance of understanding how changes in biodiversity affect disease outcomes. 
Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have reported negative
correlations between host biodiversity and disease risk, prompting suggestions
that biodiversity conservation could promote human and wildlife health. Yet the
generality of the diversity-disease linkage remains conjectural, in part because 
empirical evidence of a relationship between host competence (the ability to
maintain and transmit infections) and the order in which communities assemble has
proven elusive. Here we integrate high-resolution field data with multi-scale
experiments to show that host diversity inhibits transmission of the virulent
pathogen Ribeiroia ondatrae and reduces amphibian disease as a result of
consistent linkages among species richness, host composition and community
competence. Surveys of 345 wetlands indicated that community composition changed 
nonrandomly with species richness, such that highly competent hosts dominated in 
species-poor assemblages whereas more resistant species became progressively more
common in diverse assemblages. As a result, amphibian species richness strongly
moderated pathogen transmission and disease pathology among 24,215 examined
hosts, with a 78.4% decline in realized transmission in richer assemblages.
Laboratory and mesocosm manipulations revealed an approximately 50% decrease in
pathogen transmission and host pathology across a realistic diversity gradient
while controlling for host density, helping to establish mechanisms underlying
the diversity-disease relationship and their consequences for host fitness. By
revealing a consistent link between species richness and community competence,
these findings highlight the influence of biodiversity on infection risk and
emphasize the benefit of a community-based approach to understanding infectious
diseases.

Glacial-interglacial cycles characterized by long cold periods interrupted by
short periods of warmth are the dominant feature of Pleistocene climate, with the
relative intensity and duration of past and future interglacials being of
particular interest for civilization. The interglacials after 430,000 years ago
were characterized by warmer climates and higher atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide than the interglacials before, but the cause of this climatic
transition (the so-called mid-Brunhes event (MBE)) is unknown. Here I show, on
the basis of model simulations, that in response to insolation changes only,
feedbacks between sea ice, temperature, evaporation and salinity caused vigorous 
pre-MBE Antarctic bottom water formation and Southern Ocean ventilation. My
results also show that strong westerlies increased the pre-MBE overturning in the
Southern Ocean via an increased latitudinal insolation gradient created by
changes in eccentricity during austral winter and by changes in obliquity during 
austral summer. The stronger bottom water formation led to a cooler deep ocean
during the older interglacials. These insolation-induced differences in the
deep-sea temperature and in the Southern Ocean ventilation between the more
recent interglacials and the older ones were not expected, because there is no
straightforward systematic difference in the astronomical parameters between the 
interglacials before and after 430,000 years ago. Rather than being a real
'event', the apparent MBE seems to have resulted from a series of individual
interglacial responses--including notable exceptions to the general pattern--to
various combinations of insolation conditions. Consequently, assuming no
anthropogenic interference, future interglacials may have pre- or post-MBE
characteristics without there being a systematic change in forcings. These
findings are a first step towards understanding the magnitude change of the
interglacial carbon dioxide concentration around 430,000 years ago.

The discovery of catalysts that can be used to synthesize complex organic
compounds by enantioselective transformations is central to advances in the life 
sciences; for this reason, many chemists aim to discover catalysts that allow for
preparation of chiral molecules as predominantly one mirror-image isomer. The
ideal catalyst should not contain precious elements and should bring reactions to
completion in a few hours through operationally simple procedures. Here we
introduce a set of small organic molecules that can catalyse reactions of
unsaturated organoboron reagents with imines and carbonyls; the products of the
reactions are enantiomerically pure amines and alcohols, which might serve as
intermediates in the preparation of biologically active molecules. A
distinguishing feature of this catalyst class is the presence of a 'key' proton
embedded within their structure. Catalysts are derived from the abundant amino
acid valine and are prepared in large quantities in four steps with inexpensive
reagents. Reactions are scalable, do not demand stringent conditions, and can be 
performed with as little as 0.25 mole per cent catalyst in less than six hours at
room temperature to generate products in more than 85 per cent yield and ≥97:3
enantiomeric ratio. The efficiency, selectivity and operational simplicity of the
transformations and the range of boron-based reagents are expected to render this
advance important for future progress in syntheses of amines and alcohols, which 
are useful in chemistry, biology and medicine.

Hybrid quantum systems with inherently distinct degrees of freedom have a key
role in many physical phenomena. Well-known examples include cavity quantum
electrodynamics, trapped ions, and electrons and phonons in the solid state. In
those systems, strong coupling makes the constituents lose their individual
character and form dressed states, which represent a collective form of dynamics.
As well as having fundamental importance, hybrid systems also have practical
applications, notably in the emerging field of quantum information control. A
promising approach is to combine long-lived atomic states with the accessible
electrical degrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and quantum bits
(qubits). Here we integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. 
Apart from coupling to a microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit,
consisting of tunnel junctions and a capacitor, interacts with a phonon mode in a
micromechanical resonator, and thus acts like an atom coupled to two different
cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting of the
qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions between
the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe coherent
conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi oscillations. This is 
a model system with potential for a quantum interface, which may allow for
storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states, coupling to optical
photons or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum systems near the
classical limit.

Asteroid 4 Vesta seems to be a major intact protoplanet, with a surface
composition similar to that of the HED (howardite-eucrite-diogenite) meteorites. 
The southern hemisphere is dominated by a giant impact scar, but previous impact 
models have failed to reproduce the observed topography. The recent discovery
that Vesta's southern hemisphere is dominated by two overlapping basins provides 
an opportunity to model Vesta's topography more accurately. Here we report
three-dimensional simulations of Vesta's global evolution under two overlapping
planet-scale collisions. We closely reproduce its observed shape, and provide
maps of impact excavation and ejecta deposition. Spiral patterns observed in the 
younger basin Rheasilvia, about one billion years old, are attributed to Coriolis
forces during crater collapse. Surface materials exposed in the north come from a
depth of about 20 kilometres, according to our models, whereas materials exposed 
inside the southern double-excavation come from depths of about
60-100 kilometres. If Vesta began as a layered, completely differentiated
protoplanet, then our model predicts large areas of pure diogenites and
olivine-rich rocks. These are not seen, possibly implying that the outer
100 kilometres or so of Vesta is composed mainly of a basaltic crust (eucrites)
with ultramafic intrusions (diogenites).

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are physiologically important membrane
proteins that sense signalling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters, 
and are the targets of several prescribed drugs. Recent exciting developments are
providing unprecedented insights into the structure and function of several
medically important GPCRs. Here, through a systematic analysis of high-resolution
GPCR structures, we uncover a conserved network of non-covalent contacts that
defines the GPCR fold. Furthermore, our comparative analysis reveals
characteristic features of ligand binding and conformational changes during
receptor activation. A holistic understanding that integrates molecular and
systems biology of GPCRs holds promise for new therapeutics and personalized
medicine.

The global ridge system is dominated by oceanic rises reflecting large variations
in axial depth associated with mantle hotspots. The little-studied Marion Rise is
as large as the Icelandic Rise, considering both length and depth, but has an
axial rift (rather than a high) nearly its entire length. Uniquely along the
Southwest Indian Ridge systematic sampling allows direct examination of crustal
architecture over its full length. Here we show that, unlike the Icelandic Rise, 
peridotites are extensively exposed high on the rise, revealing that the crust is
generally thin, and often missing, over a rifted rise. Therefore the Marion Rise 
must be largely an isostatic response to ancient melting events that created
low-density depleted mantle beneath the Southwest Indian Ridge rather than
thickened crust or a large thermal anomaly. The origin of this depleted mantle is
probably the mantle emplaced into the African asthenosphere during the Karoo and 
Madagascar flood basalt events.

For many traits, including susceptibility to common diseases in humans, causal
loci uncovered by genetic-mapping studies explain only a minority of the
heritable contribution to trait variation. Multiple explanations for this
'missing heritability' have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two 
yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for
46 quantitative traits, and to detect underlying loci with high statistical
power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive
contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied. We also show that the
contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies among traits, from 
near zero to approximately 50 per cent. Detected two-locus interactions explain
only a minority of this contribution. These results substantially advance our
understanding of the missing heritability problem and have important implications
for future studies of complex and quantitative traits.

The lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy has a crucial role in defence
against infection, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and ageing. Accordingly,
agents that induce autophagy may have broad therapeutic applications. One
approach to developing such agents is to exploit autophagy manipulation
strategies used by microbial virulence factors. Here we show that a peptide,
Tat-beclin 1-derived from a region of the autophagy protein, beclin 1, which
binds human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Nef-is a potent inducer of autophagy, 
and interacts with a newly identified negative regulator of autophagy, GAPR-1
(also called GLIPR2). Tat-beclin 1 decreases the accumulation of polyglutamine
expansion protein aggregates and the replication of several pathogens (including 
HIV-1) in vitro, and reduces mortality in mice infected with chikungunya or West 
Nile virus. Thus, through the characterization of a domain of beclin 1 that
interacts with HIV-1 Nef, we have developed an autophagy-inducing peptide that
has potential efficacy in the treatment of human diseases.

The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control voluntary actions, and they
are affected by a number of debilitating neurological disorders. The prevailing
model of basal ganglia function proposes that two orthogonal projection circuits 
originating from distinct populations of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the
striatum--the so-called direct and indirect pathways--have opposing effects on
movement: activity of direct-pathway SPNs is thought to facilitate movement,
whereas activity of indirect-pathway SPNs is presumed to inhibit movement. This
model has been difficult to test owing to the lack of methods to selectively
measure the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs in freely moving
animals. Here we develop a novel in vivo method to specifically measure direct-
and indirect-pathway SPN activity, using Cre-dependent viral expression of the
genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP3 in the dorsal striatum of
D1-Cre (direct-pathway-specific) and A2A-Cre (indirect-pathway-specific) mice.
Using fibre optics and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) in mice
performing an operant task, we observed transient increases in neural activity in
both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs when animals initiated actions, but not
when they were inactive. Concurrent activation of SPNs from both pathways in one 
hemisphere preceded the initiation of contraversive movements and predicted the
occurrence of specific movements within 500 ms. These observations challenge the 
classical view of basal ganglia function and may have implications for
understanding the origin of motor symptoms in basal ganglia disorders.

The Wnt target gene Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled
receptor 5) marks actively dividing stem cells in Wnt-driven, self-renewing
tissues such as small intestine and colon, stomach and hair follicles. A
three-dimensional culture system allows long-term clonal expansion of single
Lgr5(+) stem cells into transplantable organoids (budding cysts) that retain many
characteristics of the original epithelial architecture. A crucial component of
the culture medium is the Wnt agonist RSPO1, the recently discovered ligand of
LGR5. Here we show that Lgr5-lacZ is not expressed in healthy adult liver,
however, small Lgr5-LacZ(+) cells appear near bile ducts upon damage, coinciding 
with robust activation of Wnt signalling. As shown by mouse lineage tracing using
a new Lgr5-IRES-creERT2 knock-in allele, damage-induced Lgr5(+) cells generate
hepatocytes and bile ducts in vivo. Single Lgr5(+) cells from damaged mouse liver
can be clonally expanded as organoids in Rspo1-based culture medium over several 
months. Such clonal organoids can be induced to differentiate in vitro and to
generate functional hepatocytes upon transplantation into Fah(-/-) mice. These
findings indicate that previous observations concerning Lgr5(+) stem cells in
actively self-renewing tissues can also be extended to damage-induced stem cells 
in a tissue with a low rate of spontaneous proliferation.

Experience from different fields of life sciences suggests that accessible,
complete reference maps of the components of the system under study are highly
beneficial research tools. Examples of such maps include libraries of the
spectroscopic properties of molecules, or databases of drug structures in
analytical or forensic chemistry. Such maps, and methods to navigate them,
constitute reliable assays to probe any sample for the presence and amount of
molecules contained in the map. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any
proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage. Here we use a strategy 
based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an
almost complete reference map (97% of the genome-predicted proteins) of the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We generated two versions of this
mass-spectrometric map, one supporting discovery-driven (shotgun) and the other
supporting hypothesis-driven (targeted) proteomic measurements. Together, the two
versions of the map constitute a complete set of proteomic assays to support most
studies performed with contemporary proteomic technologies. To show the utility
of the maps, we applied them to a protein quantitative trait locus (QTL)
analysis, which requires precise measurement of the same set of peptides over a
large number of samples. Protein measurements over 78 S. cerevisiae strains
revealed a complex relationship between independent genetic loci, influencing the
levels of related proteins. Our results suggest that selective pressure favours
the acquisition of sets of polymorphisms that adapt protein levels but also
maintain the stoichiometry of functionally related pathway members.

Vascular patterning is critical for organ function. In the eye, there is
simultaneous regression of embryonic hyaloid vasculature (important to clear the 
optical path) and formation of the retinal vasculature (important for the high
metabolic demands of retinal neurons). These events occur postnatally in the
mouse. Here we have identified a light-response pathway that regulates both
processes. We show that when mice are mutated in the gene (Opn4) for the atypical
opsin melanopsin, or are dark-reared from late gestation, the hyaloid vessels are
persistent at 8 days post-partum and the retinal vasculature overgrows. We
provide evidence that these vascular anomalies are explained by a light-response 
pathway that suppresses retinal neuron number, limits hypoxia and, as a
consequence, holds local expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA)
in check. We also show that the light response for this pathway occurs in late
gestation at about embryonic day 16 and requires the photopigment in the fetus
and not the mother. Measurements show that visceral cavity photon flux is
probably sufficient to activate melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in
the mouse fetus. These data thus show that light--the stimulus for function of
the mature eye--is also critical in preparing the eye for vision by regulating
retinal neuron number and initiating a series of events that ultimately pattern
the ocular blood vessels.

The construction of the vertebral column has been used as a key anatomical
character in defining and diagnosing early tetrapod groups. Rhachitomous
vertebrae--in which there is a dorsally placed neural arch and spine, an
anteroventrally placed intercentrum and paired, posterodorsally placed
pleurocentra--have long been considered the ancestral morphology for tetrapods.
Nonetheless, very little is known about vertebral anatomy in the earliest stem
tetrapods, because most specimens remain trapped in surrounding matrix, obscuring
important anatomical features. Here we describe the three-dimensional vertebral
architecture of the Late Devonian stem tetrapod Ichthyostega using propagation
phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography. Our scans reveal a diverse
array of new morphological, and associated developmental and functional,
characteristics, including a possible posterior-to-anterior vertebral
ossification sequence and the first evolutionary appearance of ossified sternal
elements. One of the most intriguing features relates to the positional
relationships between the vertebral elements, with the pleurocentra being
unexpectedly sutured or fused to the intercentra that directly succeed them,
indicating a 'reverse' rhachitomous design. Comparison of Ichthyostega with two
other stem tetrapods, Acanthostega and Pederpes, shows that reverse rhachitomous 
vertebrae may be the ancestral condition for limbed vertebrates. This study
fundamentally revises our current understanding of vertebral column evolution in 
the earliest tetrapods and raises questions about the presumed vertebral
architecture of tetrapodomorph fish and later, more crownward, tetrapods.

At mucosal surfaces, the immune system should not initiate inflammatory immune
responses to the plethora of antigens constantly present in the environment, but 
should remain poised to unleash a potent assault on intestinal pathogens. The
transcriptional programs and regulatory factors required for immune cells to
switch from homeostatic (often tissue-protective) function to potent
antimicrobial immunity are poorly defined. Mucosal retinoic-acid-receptor-related
orphan receptor-γt-positive (RORγt(+)) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are emerging 
as an important innate lymphocyte population required for immunity to intestinal 
infections. Various subsets of RORγt(+) ILCs have been described but the
transcriptional programs controlling their specification and fate remain largely 
unknown. Here we provide evidence that the transcription factor T-bet determines 
the fate of a distinct lineage of CCR6(-)RORγt(+) ILCs. Postnatally emerging
CCR6(-)RORγt(+) ILCs upregulated T-bet and this was controlled by cues from the
commensal microbiota and interleukin-23 (IL-23). In contrast, CCR6(+)RORγt(+)
ILCs, which arise earlier during ontogeny, did not express T-bet. T-bet
instructed the expression of T-bet target genes such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and 
of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. Mice genetically lacking T-bet showed
normal development of CCR6(-)RORγt(+) ILCs, but they could not differentiate into
NKp46-expressing RORγt(+) ILCs (that is, IL-22-producing natural killer (NK-22)
cells) and failed to produce IFN-γ. The production of IFN-γ by T-bet-expressing
CCR6(-)RORγt(+) ILCs was essential for the release of mucus-forming glycoproteins
required to protect the epithelial barrier during Salmonella enterica infection. 
Salmonella infection also causes severe enterocolitis that is at least partly
driven by IFN-γ. Mice deficient for T-bet or depleted of ILCs developed only mild
enterocolitis. Thus, graded expression of T-bet in CCR6(-)RORγt(+) ILCs
facilitates the differentiation of IFN-γ-producing CCR6(-)RORγt(+) ILCs required 
to protect the epithelial barrier against Salmonella infections. Co-expression of
T-bet and RORγt, which is also found in subsets of IL-17-producing T-helper
(T(H)17) cells, may be an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional program that
originally developed as part of the innate defence against infections but that
also confers an increased risk of immune-mediated pathology.

Mutational activation of BRAF is the most prevalent genetic alteration in human
melanoma, with ≥50% of tumours expressing the BRAF(V600E) oncoprotein. Moreover, 
the marked tumour regression and improved survival of late-stage BRAF-mutated
melanoma patients in response to treatment with vemurafenib demonstrates the
essential role of oncogenic BRAF in melanoma maintenance. However, as most
patients relapse with lethal drug-resistant disease, understanding and preventing
mechanism(s) of resistance is critical to providing improved therapy. Here we
investigate the cause and consequences of vemurafenib resistance using two
independently derived primary human melanoma xenograft models in which drug
resistance is selected by continuous vemurafenib administration. In one of these 
models, resistant tumours show continued dependency on BRAF(V600E)→MEK→ERK
signalling owing to elevated BRAF(V600E) expression. Most importantly, we
demonstrate that vemurafenib-resistant melanomas become drug dependent for their 
continued proliferation, such that cessation of drug administration leads to
regression of established drug-resistant tumours. We further demonstrate that a
discontinuous dosing strategy, which exploits the fitness disadvantage displayed 
by drug-resistant cells in the absence of the drug, forestalls the onset of
lethal drug-resistant disease. These data highlight the concept that
drug-resistant cells may also display drug dependency, such that altered dosing
may prevent the emergence of lethal drug resistance. Such observations may
contribute to sustaining the durability of the vemurafenib response with the
ultimate goal of curative therapy for the subset of melanoma patients with BRAF
mutations.

Glucose production by the liver is essential for providing a substrate for the
brain during fasting. The inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output
is a major aetiological factor in the hyperglycaemia of type-2 diabetes mellitus 
and other diseases of insulin resistance. For fifty years, one of the few classes
of therapeutics effective in reducing glucose production has been the biguanides,
which include phenformin and metformin, the latter the most frequently prescribed
drug for type-2 diabetes. Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of biguanides
remains imperfectly understood. The suggestion a decade ago that metformin
reduces glucose synthesis through activation of the enzyme AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) has recently been challenged by genetic loss-of-function
experiments. Here we provide a novel mechanism by which metformin antagonizes the
action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. In mouse hepatocytes,
metformin leads to the accumulation of AMP and related nucleotides, which inhibit
adenylate cyclase, reduce levels of cyclic AMP and protein kinase A (PKA)
activity, abrogate phosphorylation of critical protein targets of PKA, and block 
glucagon-dependent glucose output from hepatocytes. These data support a
mechanism of action for metformin involving antagonism of glucagon, and suggest
an approach for the development of antidiabetic drugs.

Insulin resistance represents a hallmark during the development of type 2
diabetes mellitus and in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated disturbances of
glucose and lipid metabolism. MicroRNA (miRNA)-dependent post-transcriptional
gene silencing has been recognized recently to control gene expression in disease
development and progression, including that of insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes.
The deregulation of miRNAs miR-143 (ref. 4), miR-181 (ref. 5), and miR-103 and
miR-107 (ref. 6) alters hepatic insulin sensitivity. Here we report that the
expression of miR-802 is increased in the liver of two obese mouse models and
obese human subjects. Inducible transgenic overexpression of miR-802 in mice
causes impaired glucose tolerance and attenuates insulin sensitivity, whereas
reduction of miR-802 expression improves glucose tolerance and insulin action. We
identify Hnf1b (also known as Tcf2) as a target of miR-802-dependent silencing,
and show that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of Hnf1b in liver
causes glucose intolerance, impairs insulin signalling and promotes hepatic
gluconeogenesis. In turn, hepatic overexpression of Hnf1b improves insulin
sensitivity in Lepr(db/db) mice. Thus, this study defines a critical role for
deregulated expression of miR-802 in the development of obesity-associated
impairment of glucose metabolism through targeting of Hnf1b, and assigns Hnf1b an
unexpected role in the control of hepatic insulin sensitivity.

Long-term and persistent human disturbances have simultaneously altered the
stability and diversity of ecological systems, with disturbances directly
reducing functional attributes such as invasion resistance, while eliminating the
buffering effects of high species diversity. Theory predicts that this
combination of environmental change and diversity loss increases the risk of
abrupt and potentially irreversible ecosystem collapse, but long-term empirical
evidence from natural systems is lacking. Here we demonstrate this relationship
in a degraded but species-rich pyrogenic grassland in which the combined effects 
of fire suppression, invasion and trophic collapse have created a species-poor
grassland that is highly productive, resilient to yearly climatic fluctuations,
and resistant to invasion, but vulnerable to rapid collapse after the
re-introduction of fire. We initially show how human disturbance has created a
negative relationship between diversity and function, contrary to theoretical
predictions. Fire prevention since the mid-nineteenth century is associated with 
the loss of plant species but it has stabilized high-yield annual production and 
invasion resistance, comparable to a managed high-yield low-diversity
agricultural system. In managing for fire suppression, however, a hidden
vulnerability to sudden environmental change emerges that is explained by the
elimination of the buffering effects of high species diversity. With the
re-introduction of fire, grasslands only persist in areas with remnant
concentrations of native species, in which a range of rare and mostly
functionally redundant plants proliferate after burning and prevent extensive
invasion including a rapid conversion towards woodland. This research shows how
biodiversity can be crucial for ecosystem stability despite appearing
functionally insignificant beforehand, a relationship probably applicable to many
ecosystems given the globally prevalent combination of intensive long-term land
management and species loss.

According to the Milankovitch theory, changes in summer insolation in the
high-latitude Northern Hemisphere caused glacial cycles through their impact on
ice-sheet mass balance. Statistical analyses of long climate records supported
this theory, but they also posed a substantial challenge by showing that changes 
in Southern Hemisphere climate were in phase with or led those in the north.
Although an orbitally forced Northern Hemisphere signal may have been transmitted
to the Southern Hemisphere, insolation forcing can also directly influence local 
Southern Hemisphere climate, potentially intensified by sea-ice feedback,
suggesting that the hemispheres may have responded independently to different
aspects of orbital forcing. Signal processing of climate records cannot
distinguish between these conditions, however, because the proposed insolation
forcings share essentially identical variability. Here we use transient
simulations with a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model to identify
the impacts of forcing from changes in orbits, atmospheric CO(2) concentration,
ice sheets and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on
hemispheric temperatures during the first half of the last deglaciation
(22-14.3 kyr BP). Although based on a single model, our transient simulation with
only orbital changes supports the Milankovitch theory in showing that the last
deglaciation was initiated by rising insolation during spring and summer in the
mid-latitude to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere and by terrestrial snow-albedo 
feedback. The simulation with all forcings best reproduces the timing and
magnitude of surface temperature evolution in the Southern Hemisphere in
deglacial proxy records. AMOC changes associated with an orbitally induced
retreat of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets is the most plausible explanation for
the early Southern Hemisphere deglacial warming and its lead over Northern
Hemisphere temperature; the ensuing rise in atmospheric CO(2) concentration
provided the critical feedback on global deglaciation.

Reconstructing state mixtures from diffraction measurements.

Progress in imaging and metrology depends on exquisite control over and
comprehensive characterization of wave fields. As reflected in its name, coherent
diffractive imaging relies on high coherence when reconstructing highly resolved 
images from diffraction intensities alone without the need for image-forming
lenses. Fully coherent light can be described adequately by a single pure state. 
Yet partial coherence and imperfect detection often need to be accounted for,
requiring statistical optics or the superposition of states. Furthermore, the
dynamics of samples are increasingly the very objectives of experiments. Here we 
provide a general analytic approach to the characterization of diffractive
imaging systems that can be described as low-rank mixed states. We use
experimental data and simulations to show how the reconstruction technique
compensates for and characterizes various sources of decoherence quantitatively. 
Based on ptychography, the procedure is closely related to quantum state
tomography and is equally applicable to high-resolution microscopy, wave sensing 
and fluctuation measurements. As a result, some of the most stringent
experimental conditions in ptychography can be relaxed, and susceptibility to
imaging artefacts is reduced. Furthermore, the method yields high-resolution
images of mixed states within the sample, which may include quantum mixtures or
fast stationary stochastic processes such as vibrations, switching or steady
flows.

Some observations suggest that very massive stars experience extreme mass-loss
episodes shortly before they explode as supernovae, as do several models.
Establishing a causal connection between these mass-loss episodes and the final
explosion would provide a novel way to study pre-supernova massive-star
evolution. Here we report observations of a mass-loss event detected 40 days
before the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc (also known as
PTF 10tel). Our photometric and spectroscopic data suggest that this event is a
result of an energetic outburst, radiating at least 6 × 10(47) erg of energy and 
releasing about 10(-2) solar masses of material at typical velocities of
2,000 km s(-1). The temporal proximity of the mass-loss outburst and the
supernova explosion implies a causal connection between them. Moreover, we find
that the outburst luminosity and velocity are consistent with the predictions of 
the wave-driven pulsation model, and disfavour alternative suggestions.

Spin-orbit coupling in quantum gases.

University of Maryland, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, USA.

Spin-orbit coupling links a particle's velocity to its quantum-mechanical spin,
and is essential in numerous condensed matter phenomena, including topological
insulators and Majorana fermions. In solid-state materials, spin-orbit coupling
originates from the movement of electrons in a crystal's intrinsic electric
field, which is uniquely prescribed in any given material. In contrast, for
ultracold atomic systems, the engineered 'material parameters' are tunable: a
variety of synthetic spin-orbit couplings can be engineered on demand using laser
fields. Here we outline the current experimental and theoretical status of
spin-orbit coupling in ultracold atomic systems, discussing unique features that 
enable physics impossible in any other known setting.

Candida albicans, the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, is considered to be
an obligate diploid that carries recessive lethal mutations throughout the
genome. Here we demonstrate that C. albicans has a viable haploid state that can 
be derived from diploid cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and that
seems to arise through a concerted chromosome loss mechanism. Haploids undergo
morphogenetic changes like those of diploids, including the yeast-hyphal
transition, chlamydospore formation and a white-opaque switch that facilitates
mating. Haploid opaque cells of opposite mating type mate efficiently to
regenerate the diploid form, restoring heterozygosity and fitness. Homozygous
diploids arise spontaneously by auto-diploidization, and both haploids and
auto-diploids show a similar reduction in fitness, in vitro and in vivo, relative
to heterozygous diploids, indicating that homozygous cell types are transient in 
mixed populations. Finally, we constructed stable haploid strains with multiple
auxotrophies that will facilitate molecular and genetic analyses of this
important pathogen.

Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) genes encode a broadly conserved family of
multipass integral membrane proteins in animals. Human TMC1 and TMC2 genes are
linked to human deafness and required for hair-cell mechanotransduction; however,
the molecular functions of these and other TMC proteins have not been determined.
Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans tmc-1 gene encodes a sodium sensor
that functions specifically in salt taste chemosensation. tmc-1 is expressed in
the ASH polymodal avoidance neurons, where it is required for salt-evoked
neuronal activity and behavioural avoidance of high concentrations of NaCl.
However, tmc-1 has no effect on responses to other stimuli sensed by the ASH
neurons including high osmolarity and chemical repellents, indicating a specific 
role in salt sensation. When expressed in mammalian cell culture, C. elegans
TMC-1 generates a predominantly cationic conductance activated by high
extracellular sodium but not by other cations or uncharged small molecules. Thus,
TMC-1 is both necessary for salt sensation in vivo and sufficient to generate a
sodium-sensitive channel in vitro, identifying it as a probable ionotropic
sensory receptor.

Logic devices based on magnetism show promise for increasing computational
efficiency while decreasing consumed power. They offer zero quiescent power and
yet combine novel functions such as programmable logic operation and non-volatile
built-in memory. However, practical efforts to adapt a magnetic device to logic
suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and other performance attributes that are
not adequate for logic gates. Rather than exploiting magnetoresistive effects
that result from spin-dependent transport of carriers, we have approached the
development of a magnetic logic device in a different way: we use the phenomenon 
of large magnetoresistance found in non-magnetic semiconductors in high electric 
fields. Here we report a device showing a strong diode characteristic that is
highly sensitive to both the sign and the magnitude of an external magnetic
field, offering a reversible change between two different characteristic states
by the application of a magnetic field. This feature results from magnetic
control of carrier generation and recombination in an InSb p-n bilayer channel.
Simple circuits combining such elementary devices are fabricated and tested, and 
Boolean logic functions including AND, OR, NAND and NOR are performed. They are
programmed dynamically by external electric or magnetic signals, demonstrating
magnetic-field-controlled semiconductor reconfigurable logic at room temperature.
This magnetic technology permits a new kind of spintronic device, characterized
as a current switch rather than a voltage switch, and provides a simple and
compact platform for non-volatile reconfigurable logic devices.

Digital production, transmission and storage have revolutionized how we access
and use information but have also made archiving an increasingly complex task
that requires active, continuing maintenance of digital media. This challenge has
focused some interest on DNA as an attractive target for information storage
because of its capacity for high-density information encoding, longevity under
easily achieved conditions and proven track record as an information bearer.
Previous DNA-based information storage approaches have encoded only trivial
amounts of information or were not amenable to scaling-up, and used no robust
error-correction and lacked examination of their cost-efficiency for large-scale 
information archival. Here we describe a scalable method that can reliably store 
more information than has been handled before. We encoded computer files
totalling 739 kilobytes of hard-disk storage and with an estimated Shannon
information of 5.2 × 10(6) bits into a DNA code, synthesized this DNA, sequenced 
it and reconstructed the original files with 100% accuracy. Theoretical analysis 
indicates that our DNA-based storage scheme could be scaled far beyond current
global information volumes and offers a realistic technology for large-scale,
long-term and infrequently accessed digital archiving. In fact, current trends in
technological advances are reducing DNA synthesis costs at a pace that should
make our scheme cost-effective for sub-50-year archiving within a decade.

Cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to patient-specific induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) enables in vitro modelling of human genetic disorders for
pathogenic investigations and therapeutic screens. However, using iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to model an adult-onset heart disease remains
challenging owing to the uncertainty regarding the ability of relatively immature
iPSC-CMs to fully recapitulate adult disease phenotypes. Arrhythmogenic right
ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an inherited heart disease
characterized by pathological fatty infiltration and cardiomyocyte loss
predominantly in the right ventricle, which is associated with life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmias. Over 50% of affected individuals have desmosome gene
mutations, most commonly in PKP2, encoding plakophilin-2 (ref. 9). The median age
at presentation of ARVD/C is 26 years. We used previously published methods to
generate iPSC lines from fibroblasts of two patients with ARVD/C and PKP2
mutations. Mutant PKP2 iPSC-CMs demonstrate abnormal plakoglobin nuclear
translocation and decreased β-catenin activity in cardiogenic conditions; yet,
these abnormal features are insufficient to reproduce the pathological phenotypes
of ARVD/C in standard cardiogenic conditions. Here we show that induction of
adult-like metabolic energetics from an embryonic/glycolytic state and abnormal
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) activation underlie the
pathogenesis of ARVD/C. By co-activating normal PPAR-alpha-dependent metabolism
and abnormal PPAR-γ pathway in beating embryoid bodies (EBs) with defined media, 
we established an efficient ARVD/C in vitro model within 2 months. This model
manifests exaggerated lipogenesis and apoptosis in mutant PKP2 iPSC-CMs. iPSC-CMs
with a homozygous PKP2 mutation also had calcium-handling deficits. Our study is 
the first to demonstrate that induction of adult-like metabolism has a critical
role in establishing an adult-onset disease model using patient-specific iPSCs.
Using this model, we revealed crucial pathogenic insights that metabolic
derangement in adult-like metabolic milieu underlies ARVD/C pathologies, enabling
us to propose novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategies.

Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are innate
immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through
disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation-initiation
machinery. However, it was recently discovered that IFITs can directly recognize 
viral RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular
signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here we report crystal structures 
of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an amino-terminal fragment of
IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively
charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single-stranded PPP-RNA, thus
distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double-stranded viral
PPP-RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also known as DDX58). Mutational 
analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a
non-sequence-specific manner and requires a 5'-overhang of approximately three
nucleotides. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 was found to cause 
a defect in the antiviral response by human embryonic kidney cells. These results
demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA,
and lend insight into their downstream effector function.

Mitotic cell rounding accelerates epithelial invagination.

Biology, 2-2-3, Minatojima-Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan.

Mitotic cells assume a spherical shape by increasing their surface tension and
osmotic pressure by extensively reorganizing their interphase actin cytoskeleton 
into a cortical meshwork and their microtubules into the mitotic spindle. Mitotic
entry is known to interfere with tissue morphogenetic events that require
cell-shape changes controlled by the interphase cytoskeleton, such as apical
constriction. However, here we show that mitosis plays an active role in the
epithelial invagination of the Drosophila melanogaster tracheal placode.
Invagination begins with a slow phase under the control of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) signalling; in this process, the central apically
constricted cells, which are surrounded by intercalating cells, form a shallow
pit. This slow phase is followed by a fast phase, in which the pit is rapidly
depressed, accompanied by mitotic entry, which leads to the internalization of
all the cells in the placode. We found that mitotic cell rounding, but not cell
division, of the central cells in the placode is required to accelerate
invagination, in conjunction with EGFR-induced myosin II contractility in the
surrounding cells. We propose that mitotic cell rounding causes the epithelium to
buckle under pressure and acts as a switch for morphogenetic transition at the
appropriate time.

The intestinal microbiota has a critical role in immune system and metabolic
homeostasis, but it must be tolerated by the host to avoid inflammatory responses
that can damage the epithelial barrier separating the host from the luminal
contents. Breakdown of this regulation and the resulting inappropriate immune
response to commensals are thought to lead to the development of inflammatory
bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We proposed that
the intestinal immune system is instructed by the microbiota to limit responses
to luminal antigens. Here we demonstrate in mice that, at steady state, the
microbiota inhibits the transport of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria from 
the lumen to a key immune inductive site, the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs).
However, in the absence of Myd88 or under conditions of antibiotic-induced
dysbiosis, non-invasive bacteria were trafficked to the MLNs in a CCR7-dependent 
manner, and induced both T-cell responses and IgA production. Trafficking was
carried out by CX(3)CR1(hi) mononuclear phagocytes, an intestinal-cell population
previously reported to be non-migratory. These findings define a central role for
commensals in regulating the migration to the MLNs of CX(3)CR1(hi) mononuclear
phagocytes endowed with the ability to capture luminal bacteria, thereby
compartmentalizing the intestinal immune response to avoid inflammation.

The advantages of using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) instead of
embryonic stem (ES) cells in regenerative medicine centre around circumventing
concerns about the ethics of using ES cells and the likelihood of immune
rejection of ES-cell-derived tissues. However, partial reprogramming and genetic 
instabilities in iPSCs could elicit immune responses in transplant recipients
even when iPSC-derived differentiated cells are transplanted. iPSCs are first
differentiated into specific types of cells in vitro for subsequent
transplantation. Although model transplantation experiments have been conducted
using various iPSC-derived differentiated tissues and immune rejections have not 
been observed, careful investigation of the immunogenicity of iPSC-derived tissue
is becoming increasingly critical, especially as this has not been the focus of
most studies done so far. A recent study reported immunogenicity of iPSC- but not
ES-cell-derived teratomas and implicated several causative genes. Nevertheless,
some controversy has arisen regarding these findings. Here we examine the
immunogenicity of differentiated skin and bone marrow tissues derived from mouse 
iPSCs. To ensure optimal comparison of iPSCs and ES cells, we established ten
integration-free iPSC and seven ES-cell lines using an inbred mouse strain,
C57BL/6. We observed no differences in the rate of success of transplantation
when skin and bone marrow cells derived from iPSCs were compared with
ES-cell-derived tissues. Moreover, we observed limited or no immune responses,
including T-cell infiltration, for tissues derived from either iPSCs or ES cells,
and no increase in the expression of the immunogenicity-causing Zg16 and Hormad1 
genes in regressing skin and teratoma tissues. Our findings suggest limited
immunogenicity of transplanted cells differentiated from iPSCs and ES cells.

Febrifugine is the active component of the Chinese herb Chang Shan (Dichroa
febrifuga Lour.), which has been used for treating malaria-induced fever for
about 2,000 years. Halofuginone (HF), the halogenated derivative of febrifugine, 
has been tested in clinical trials for potential therapeutic applications in
cancer and fibrotic disease. Recently, HF was reported to inhibit T(H)17 cell
differentiation by activating the amino acid response pathway, through inhibiting
human prolyl-transfer RNA synthetase (ProRS) to cause intracellular accumulation 
of uncharged tRNA. Curiously, inhibition requires the presence of unhydrolysed
ATP. Here we report an unusual 2.0 Å structure showing that ATP directly locks
onto and orients two parts of HF onto human ProRS, so that one part of HF mimics 
bound proline and the other mimics the 3' end of bound tRNA. Thus, HF is a new
type of ATP-dependent inhibitor that simultaneously occupies two different
substrate binding sites on ProRS. Moreover, our structure indicates a possible
similar mechanism of action for febrifugine in malaria treatment. Finally, the
elucidation here of a two-site modular targeting activity of HF raises the
possibility that substrate-directed capture of similar inhibitors might be a
general mechanism that could be applied to other synthetases.

Chronic neuroinflammation is a common feature of the ageing brain and some
neurodegenerative disorders. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying the regulation of innate immunity in the central nervous system remain
elusive. Here we show that the astrocytic dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) modulates
innate immunity through αB-crystallin (CRYAB), which is known to suppress
neuroinflammation. We demonstrate that knockout mice lacking Drd2 showed
remarkable inflammatory response in multiple central nervous system regions and
increased the vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons to neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity.
Astrocytes null for Drd2 became hyper-responsive to immune stimuli with a marked 
reduction in the level of CRYAB. Preferential ablation of Drd2 in astrocytes
robustly activated astrocytes in the substantia nigra. Gain- or loss-of-function 
studies showed that CRYAB is critical for DRD2-mediated modulation of innate
immune response in astrocytes. Furthermore, treatment of wild-type mice with the 
selective DRD2 agonist quinpirole increased resistance of the nigral dopaminergic
neurons to MPTP through partial suppression of inflammation. Our study indicates

Arising from S. Pawar, A. I. Dell & V. M. Savage 486, 485-489
10.1038/nature11131(2012)A recent paper by Pawar and colleagues has provided
important insights into the consequences of foraging behaviour for food-web
dynamics. One notable pattern predicted by their analysis is that consumption
rate (c) scales superlinearly (cm(1.16)) with consumer body mass (m) in
three-dimensional (3D), but not two-dimensional (2D), foraging spaces. Although
we feel that the authors should be applauded for this interesting contribution,
we argue that their result is not consistent with established life-history
theory. To resolve this contradiction, progress in both fields is probably
required, including new empirical studies in which consumption rate, metabolism
and dimensionality are examined directly under natural conditions.

Stroking of the skin produces pleasant sensations that can occur during social
interactions with conspecifics, such as grooming. Despite numerous physiological 
studies (reviewed in ref. 2), molecularly defined sensory neurons that detect
pleasant stroking of hairy skin in vivo have not been reported. Previously, we
identified a rare population of unmyelinated sensory neurons in mice that express
the G-protein-coupled receptor MRGPRB4 (refs 5, 6). These neurons exclusively
innervate hairy skin with large terminal arborizations that resemble the
receptive fields of C-tactile (CT) afferents in humans. Unlike other molecularly 
defined mechanosensory C-fibre subtypes, MRGPRB4(+) neurons could not be
detectably activated by sensory stimulation of the skin ex vivo. Therefore, we
developed a preparation for calcium imaging in the spinal projections of these
neurons during stimulation of the periphery in intact mice. Here we show that
MRGPRB4(+) neurons are activated by massage-like stroking of hairy skin, but not 
by noxious punctate mechanical stimulation. By contrast, a different population
of C fibres expressing MRGPRD was activated by pinching but not by stroking,
consistent with previous physiological and behavioural data. Pharmacogenetic
activation of Mrgprb4-expressing neurons in freely behaving mice promoted
conditioned place preference, indicating that such activation is positively
reinforcing and/or anxiolytic. These data open the way to understanding the
function of MRGPRB4 neurons during natural behaviours, and provide a general
approach to the functional characterization of genetically identified subsets of 
somatosensory neurons in vivo.

Deep instability of deforested tropical peatlands revealed by fluvial organic
carbon fluxes.

Tropical peatlands contain one of the largest pools of terrestrial organic
carbon, amounting to about 89,000 teragrams (1 Tg is a billion kilograms).
Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive
anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are
converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact
peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic
disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed
peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp
forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91
per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic
carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary
production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed
peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon
from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term,
which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases 
the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22
per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted
in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia--an 
increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux 
from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial 
carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and
drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances.

forcing.

As a result of global warming, precipitation is likely to increase in high
latitudes and the tropics and to decrease in already dry subtropical regions. The
absolute magnitude and regional details of such changes, however, remain
intensely debated. As is well known from El Niño studies, sea-surface-temperature
gradients across the tropical Pacific Ocean can strongly influence global
rainfall. Palaeoproxy evidence indicates that the difference between the warm
west Pacific and the colder east Pacific increased in past periods when the Earth
warmed as a result of increased solar radiation. In contrast, in most model
projections of future greenhouse warming this gradient weakens. It has not been
clear how to reconcile these two findings. Here we show in climate model
simulations that the tropical Pacific sea-surface-temperature gradient increases 
when the warming is due to increased solar radiation and decreases when it is due
to increased greenhouse-gas forcing. For the same global surface temperature
increase the latter pattern produces less rainfall, notably over tropical land,
which explains why in the model the late twentieth century is warmer than in the 
Medieval Warm Period (around AD 1000-1250) but precipitation is less. This
difference is consistent with the global tropospheric energy budget, which
requires a balance between the latent heat released in precipitation and
radiative cooling. The tropospheric cooling is less for increased greenhouse
gases, which add radiative absorbers to the troposphere, than for increased solar
heating, which is concentrated at the Earth's surface. Thus warming due to
increased greenhouse gases produces a climate signature different from that of
warming due to solar radiation changes.

Magnetic ratchet for three-dimensional spintronic memory and logic.

One of the key challenges for future electronic memory and logic devices is
finding viable ways of moving from today's two-dimensional structures, which hold
data in an x-y mesh of cells, to three-dimensional structures in which data are
stored in an x-y-z lattice of cells. This could allow a many-fold increase in
performance. A suggested solution is the shift register--a digital building block
that passes data from cell to cell along a chain. In conventional digital
microelectronics, two-dimensional shift registers are routinely constructed from 
a number of connected transistors. However, for three-dimensional devices the
added process complexity and space needed for such transistors would largely
cancel out the benefits of moving into the third dimension. 'Physical' shift
registers, in which an intrinsic physical phenomenon is used to move data
near-atomic distances, without requiring conventional transistors, are therefore 
much preferred. Here we demonstrate a way of implementing a spintronic
unidirectional vertical shift register between perpendicularly magnetized
ferromagnets of subnanometre thickness, similar to the layers used in
non-volatile magnetic random-access memory. By carefully controlling the
thickness of each magnetic layer and the exchange coupling between the layers, we
form a ratchet that allows information in the form of a sharp magnetic kink
soliton to be unidirectionally pumped (or 'shifted') from one magnetic layer to
another. This simple and efficient shift-register concept suggests a route to the
creation of three-dimensional microchips for memory and logic applications.

From the masses of the planets orbiting the Sun, and the abundance of elements
relative to hydrogen, it is estimated that when the Solar System formed, the
circumstellar disk must have had a minimum mass of around 0.01 solar masses
within about 100 astronomical units of the star. (One astronomical unit is the
Earth-Sun distance.) The main constituent of the disk, gaseous molecular
hydrogen, does not efficiently emit radiation from the disk mass reservoir, and
so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission and lines of
gaseous carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emission generally indicates properties 
of the disk surface, and the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires
knowledge of the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio, which probably 
differ from their interstellar values. As a result, mass estimates vary by orders
of magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3-10 million years) star
TW Hydrae, for which the range is 0.0005-0.06 solar masses. Here we report the
detection of the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride from the
direction of TW Hydrae. Hydrogen deuteride is a good tracer of disk gas because
it follows the distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive
to the total mass. The detection of hydrogen deuteride, combined with existing
observations and detailed models, implies a disk mass of more than 0.05 solar
masses, which is enough to form a planetary system like our own.

The development of collective long-range order by means of phase transitions
occurs by the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries. Magnetism is a
consequence of broken time-reversal symmetry, whereas superfluidity results from 
broken gauge invariance. The broken symmetry that develops below 17.5 kelvin in
the heavy-fermion compound URu(2)Si(2) has long eluded such identification. Here 
we show that the recent observation of Ising quasiparticles in URu(2)Si(2)
results from a spinor order parameter that breaks double time-reversal symmetry, 
mixing states of integer and half-integer spin. Such 'hastatic' order hybridizes 
uranium-atom conduction electrons with Ising 5f(2) states to produce Ising
quasiparticles; it accounts for the large entropy of condensation and the
magnetic anomaly observed in torque magnetometry. Hastatic order predicts a tiny 
transverse moment in the conduction-electron 'sea', a colossal Ising anisotropy
in the nonlinear susceptibility anomaly and a resonant, energy-dependent
nematicity in the tunnelling density of states.

Genetic and biochemical analyses of RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) 
pathways have revealed proteins such as Argonaute and Dicer as essential
cofactors that process and present small RNAs to their targets. Well-validated
small RNA pathway cofactors such as these show distinctive patterns of
conservation or divergence in particular animal, plant, fungal and protist
species. We compared 86 divergent eukaryotic genome sequences to discern sets of 
proteins that show similar phylogenetic profiles with known small RNA cofactors. 
A large set of additional candidate small RNA cofactors have emerged from
functional genomic screens for defects in miRNA- or short interfering RNA
(siRNA)-mediated repression in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila
melanogaster, and from proteomic analyses of proteins co-purifying with validated
small RNA pathway proteins. The phylogenetic profiles of many of these candidate 
small RNA pathway proteins are similar to those of known small RNA cofactor
proteins. We used a Bayesian approach to integrate the phylogenetic profile
analysis with predictions from diverse transcriptional coregulation and proteome 
interaction data sets to assign a probability for each protein for a role in a
small RNA pathway. Testing high-confidence candidates from this analysis for
defects in RNAi silencing, we found that about one-half of the predicted small
RNA cofactors are required for RNAi silencing. Many of the newly identified small
RNA pathway proteins are orthologues of proteins implicated in RNA splicing. In
support of a deep connection between the mechanism of RNA splicing and
small-RNA-mediated gene silencing, the presence of the Argonaute proteins and
other small RNA components in the many species analysed strongly correlates with 
the number of introns in those species.

Mechanical responsiveness is essential to all biological systems down to the
level of tissues and cells. The intra- and extracellular mechanics of such
systems are governed by a series of proteins, such as microtubules, actin,
intermediate filaments and collagen. As a general design motif, these proteins
self-assemble into helical structures and superstructures that differ in diameter
and persistence length to cover the full mechanical spectrum. Gels of
cytoskeletal proteins display particular mechanical responses (stress stiffening)
that until now have been absent in synthetic polymeric and low-molar-mass gels.
Here we present synthetic gels that mimic in nearly all aspects gels prepared
from intermediate filaments. They are prepared from polyisocyanopeptides grafted 
with oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. These responsive polymers possess a
stiff and helical architecture, and show a tunable thermal transition where the
chains bundle together to generate transparent gels at extremely low
concentrations. Using characterization techniques operating at different length
scales (for example, macroscopic rheology, atomic force microscopy and molecular 
force spectroscopy) combined with an appropriate theoretical network model, we
establish the hierarchical relationship between the bulk mechanical properties
and the single-molecule parameters. Our results show that to develop artificial
cytoskeletal or extracellular matrix mimics, the essential design parameters are 
not only the molecular stiffness, but also the extent of bundling. In contrast to
the peptidic materials, our polyisocyanide polymers are readily modified, giving 
a starting point for functional biomimetic hydrogels with potentially a wide
variety of applications, in particular in the biomedical field.

The active centre of the spliceosome consists of an intricate network formed by
U5, U2 and U6 small nuclear RNAs, and a pre-messenger-RNA substrate. Prp8, a
component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, crosslinks
extensively with this RNA catalytic core. Here we present the crystal structure
of yeast Prp8 (residues 885-2413) in complex with Aar2, a U5 small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein particle assembly factor. The structure reveals tightly
associated domains of Prp8 resembling a bacterial group II intron reverse
transcriptase and a type II restriction endonuclease. Suppressors of splice-site 
mutations, and an intron branch-point crosslink, map to a large cavity formed by 
the reverse transcriptase thumb, and the endonuclease-like and RNaseH-like
domains. This cavity is large enough to accommodate the catalytic core of
group II intron RNA. The structure provides crucial insights into the
architecture of the spliceosome active site, and reinforces the notion that
nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and group II intron splicing have a common origin.

Reciprocal regulation of p53 and malic enzymes modulates metabolism and
senescence.

Cellular senescence both protects multicellular organisms from cancer and
contributes to their ageing. The pre-eminent tumour suppressor p53 has an
important role in the induction and maintenance of senescence, but how it carries
out this function remains poorly understood. In addition, although increasing
evidence supports the idea that metabolic changes underlie many cell-fate
decisions and p53-mediated tumour suppression, few connections between metabolic 
enzymes and senescence have been established. Here we describe a new mechanism by
which p53 links these functions. We show that p53 represses the expression of the
tricarboxylic-acid-cycle-associated malic enzymes ME1 and ME2 in human and mouse 
cells. Both malic enzymes are important for NADPH production, lipogenesis and
glutamine metabolism, but ME2 has a more profound effect. Through the inhibition 
of malic enzymes, p53 regulates cell metabolism and proliferation. Downregulation
of ME1 and ME2 reciprocally activates p53 through distinct MDM2- and
AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated mechanisms in a feed-forward manner,
bolstering this pathway and enhancing p53 activation. Downregulation of ME1 and
ME2 also modulates the outcome of p53 activation, leading to strong induction of 
senescence, but not apoptosis, whereas enforced expression of either malic enzyme
suppresses senescence. Our findings define physiological functions of malic
enzymes, demonstrate a positive-feedback mechanism that sustains p53 activation, 
and reveal a connection between metabolism and senescence mediated by p53.

Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying
causes are rarely known. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two
divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian
genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene. Here
we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social
polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes
that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants,
hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are
characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55% of the
chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb.
Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between 
Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons
revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 
616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two
variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic 
social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9
megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of
deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining
region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the 
genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two
social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how
genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes
involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination.

In various cellular membrane systems, vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) function as
proton pumps, which are involved in many processes such as bone resorption and
cancer metastasis, and these membrane proteins represent attractive drug targets 
for osteoporosis and cancer. The hydrophilic V(1) portion is known as a rotary
motor, in which a central axis DF complex rotates inside a hexagonally arranged
catalytic A(3)B(3) complex using ATP hydrolysis energy, but the molecular
mechanism is not well defined owing to a lack of high-resolution structural
information. We previously reported on the in vitro expression, purification and 
reconstitution of Enterococcus hirae V(1)-ATPase from the A(3)B(3) and DF
complexes. Here we report the asymmetric structures of the nucleotide-free
(2.8 Å) and nucleotide-bound (3.4 Å) A(3)B(3) complex that demonstrate
conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding, suggesting a binding order 
in the right-handed rotational orientation in a cooperative manner. The crystal
structures of the nucleotide-free (2.2 Å) and nucleotide-bound (2.7 Å)
V(1)-ATPase are also reported. The more tightly packed nucleotide-binding site
seems to be induced by DF binding, and ATP hydrolysis seems to be stimulated by
the approach of a conserved arginine residue. To our knowledge, these asymmetric 
structures represent the first high-resolution view of the rotational mechanism
of V(1)-ATPase.

The initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is regulated by a
plethora of proteins in human cells. The first general transcription factor to
bind gene promoters is transcription factor IID (TFIID). TFIID triggers
pre-initiation complex formation, functions as a coactivator by interacting with 
transcriptional activators and reads epigenetic marks. TFIID is a
megadalton-sized multiprotein complex composed of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) 
and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Despite its crucial role, the detailed
architecture and assembly mechanism of TFIID remain elusive. Histone fold domains
are prevalent in TAFs, and histone-like tetramer and octamer structures have been
proposed in TFIID. A functional core-TFIID subcomplex was revealed in Drosophila 
nuclei, consisting of a subset of TAFs (TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF9 and TAF12). These 
core subunits are thought to be present in two copies in holo-TFIID, in contrast 
to TBP and other TAFs that are present in a single copy, conveying a transition
from symmetry to asymmetry in the TFIID assembly pathway. Here we present the
structure of human core-TFIID determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 11.6 Å
resolution. Our structure reveals a two-fold symmetric, interlaced architecture, 
with pronounced protrusions, that accommodates all conserved structural features 
of the TAFs including the histone folds. We further demonstrate that binding of
one TAF8-TAF10 complex breaks the original symmetry of core-TFIID. We propose
that the resulting asymmetric structure serves as a functional scaffold to
nucleate holo-TFIID assembly, by accreting one copy each of the remaining TAFs
and TBP.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway regulates
organismal growth in response to many environmental cues, including nutrients and
growth factors. Cell-based studies showed that mTORC1 senses amino acids through 
the RagA-D family of GTPases (also known as RRAGA, B, C and D), but their
importance in mammalian physiology is unknown. Here we generate knock-in mice
that express a constitutively active form of RagA (RagA(GTP)) from its endogenous
promoter. RagA(GTP/GTP) mice develop normally, but fail to survive postnatal day 
1. When delivered by Caesarean section, fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates die almost 
twice as rapidly as wild-type littermates. Within an hour of birth, wild-type
neonates strongly inhibit mTORC1, which coincides with profound hypoglycaemia and
a decrease in plasma amino-acid concentrations. In contrast, mTORC1 inhibition
does not occur in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, despite identical reductions in blood
nutrient amounts. With prolonged fasting, wild-type neonates recover their plasma
glucose concentrations, but RagA(GTP/GTP) mice remain hypoglycaemic until death, 
despite using glycogen at a faster rate. The glucose homeostasis defect
correlates with the inability of fasted RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates to trigger
autophagy and produce amino acids for de novo glucose production. Because
profound hypoglycaemia does not inhibit mTORC1 in RagA(GTP/GTP) neonates, we
considered the possibility that the Rag pathway signals glucose as well as
amino-acid sufficiency to mTORC1. Indeed, mTORC1 is resistant to glucose
deprivation in RagA(GTP/GTP) fibroblasts, and glucose, like amino acids, controls
its recruitment to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. Thus,
the Rag GTPases signal glucose and amino-acid concentrations to mTORC1, and have 
an unexpectedly key role in neonates in autophagy induction and thus nutrient
homeostasis and viability.

egress.

The splenic marginal zone is a unique microenvironment where resident immune
cells are exposed to the open blood circulation. Even though it has an important 
role in responses against blood-borne antigens, lymphocyte migration in the
marginal zone has not been intravitally visualized due to challenges associated
with achieving adequate imaging depth in this abdominal organ. Here we develop a 
two-photon microscopy procedure to study marginal zone and follicular B-cell
movement in the live mouse spleen. We show that marginal zone B cells are highly 
motile and exhibit long membrane extensions. Marginal zone B cells shuttle
between the marginal zone and follicles with at least one-fifth of the cells
exchanging between compartments per hour, a behaviour that explains their ability
to deliver antigens rapidly from the open blood circulation to the secluded
follicles. Follicular B cells also transit from follicles to the marginal zone,
but unlike marginal zone B cells, they fail to undergo integrin-mediated
adhesion, become caught in fluid flow and are carried into the red pulp.
Follicular B-cell egress via the marginal zone is sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptor-1 (S1PR1)-dependent. This study shows that marginal zone B cells migrate
continually between marginal zone and follicles and establishes the marginal zone
as a site of S1PR1-dependent B-cell exit from follicles. The results also show
how adhesive differences of similar cells critically influence their behaviour in
the same microenvironment.

Mitochondrial DNA mutations transmitted maternally within the oocyte cytoplasm
often cause life-threatening disorders. Here we explore the use of nuclear genome
transfer between unfertilized oocytes of two donors to prevent the transmission
of mitochondrial mutations. Nuclear genome transfer did not reduce developmental 
efficiency to the blastocyst stage, and genome integrity was maintained provided 
that spontaneous oocyte activation was avoided through the transfer of
incompletely assembled spindle-chromosome complexes. Mitochondrial DNA
transferred with the nuclear genome was initially detected at levels below 1%,
decreasing in blastocysts and stem-cell lines to undetectable levels, and
remained undetectable after passaging for more than one year, clonal expansion,
differentiation into neurons, cardiomyocytes or β-cells, and after cellular
reprogramming. Stem cells and differentiated cells had mitochondrial respiratory 
chain enzyme activities and oxygen consumption rates indistinguishable from
controls. These results demonstrate the potential of nuclear genome transfer to
prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disorders in humans.

Alzheimer's disease is the world's most common dementing illness. Deposition of
amyloid-β peptide drives cerebral neuroinflammation by activating microglia.
Indeed, amyloid-β activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is
fundamental for interleukin-1β maturation and subsequent inflammatory events.
However, it remains unknown whether NLRP3 activation contributes to Alzheimer's
disease in vivo. Here we demonstrate strongly enhanced active caspase-1
expression in human mild cognitive impairment and brains with Alzheimer's
disease, suggesting a role for the inflammasome in this neurodegenerative
disease. Nlrp3(-/-) or Casp1(-/-) mice carrying mutations associated with
familial Alzheimer's disease were largely protected from loss of spatial memory
and other sequelae associated with Alzheimer's disease, and demonstrated reduced 
brain caspase-1 and interleukin-1β activation as well as enhanced amyloid-β
clearance. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome deficiency skewed microglial cells to 
an M2 phenotype and resulted in the decreased deposition of amyloid-β in the
APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease. These results show an important role for
the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and suggest 
that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition represents a new therapeutic intervention for 
the disease.

Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with severe human diseases 
and are maternally inherited through the egg's cytoplasm. Here we investigated
the feasibility of mtDNA replacement in human oocytes by spindle transfer (ST;
also called spindle-chromosomal complex transfer). Of 106 human oocytes donated
for research, 65 were subjected to reciprocal ST and 33 served as controls.
Fertilization rate in ST oocytes (73%) was similar to controls (75%); however, a 
significant portion of ST zygotes (52%) showed abnormal fertilization as
determined by an irregular number of pronuclei. Among normally fertilized ST
zygotes, blastocyst development (62%) and embryonic stem cell isolation (38%)
rates were comparable to controls. All embryonic stem cell lines derived from ST 
zygotes had normal euploid karyotypes and contained exclusively donor mtDNA. The 
mtDNA can be efficiently replaced in human oocytes. Although some ST oocytes
displayed abnormal fertilization, remaining embryos were capable of developing to
blastocysts and producing embryonic stem cells similar to controls.

The use of molecular spin state as a quantum of information for storage, sensing 
and computing has generated considerable interest in the context of
next-generation data storage and communication devices, opening avenues for
developing multifunctional molecular spintronics. Such ideas have been researched
extensively, using single-molecule magnets and molecules with a metal ion or
nitrogen vacancy as localized spin-carrying centres for storage and for realizing
logic operations. However, the electronic coupling between the spin centres of
these molecules is rather weak, which makes construction of quantum memory
registers a challenging task. In this regard, delocalized carbon-based radical
species with unpaired spin, such as phenalenyl, have shown promise. These
phenalenyl moieties, which can be regarded as graphene fragments, are formed by
the fusion of three benzene rings and belong to the class of open-shell systems. 
The spin structure of these molecules responds to external stimuli (such as
light, and electric and magnetic fields), which provides novel schemes for
performing spin memory and logic operations. Here we construct a molecular device
using such molecules as templates to engineer interfacial spin transfer resulting
from hybridization and magnetic exchange interaction with the surface of a
ferromagnet; the device shows an unexpected interfacial magnetoresistance of more
than 20 per cent near room temperature. Moreover, we successfully demonstrate the
formation of a nanoscale magnetic molecule with a well-defined magnetic
hysteresis on ferromagnetic surfaces. Owing to strong magnetic coupling with the 
ferromagnet, such independent switching of an adsorbed magnetic molecule has been
unsuccessful with single-molecule magnets. Our findings suggest the use of
chemically amenable phenalenyl-based molecules as a viable and scalable platform 
for building molecular-scale quantum spin memory and processors for technological
development.

Laser cooling of a semiconductor by 40 kelvin.

Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, 637371, Singapore.

Optical irradiation accompanied by spontaneous anti-Stokes emission can lead to
cooling of matter, in a phenomenon known as laser cooling, or optical
refrigeration, which was proposed by Pringsheim in 1929. In gaseous matter, an
extremely low temperature can be obtained in diluted atomic gases by Doppler
cooling, and laser cooling of ultradense gas has been demonstrated by collisional
redistribution of radiation. In solid-state materials, laser cooling is achieved 
by the annihilation of phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibrations, during
anti-Stokes luminescence. Since the first experimental demonstration in glasses
doped with rare-earth metals, considerable progress has been made, particularly
in ytterbium-doped glasses or crystals: recently a record was set of cooling to
about 110 kelvin from the ambient temperature, surpassing the thermoelectric
Peltier cooler. It would be interesting to realize laser cooling in
semiconductors, in which excitonic resonances dominate, rather than in systems
doped with rare-earth metals, where atomic resonances dominate. However, so far
no net cooling in semiconductors has been achieved despite much experimental and 
theoretical work, mainly on group-III-V gallium arsenide quantum wells. Here we
report a net cooling by about 40 kelvin in a semiconductor using group-II-VI
cadmium sulphide nanoribbons, or nanobelts, starting from 290 kelvin. We use a
pump laser with a wavelength of 514 nanometres, and obtain an estimated cooling
efficiency of about 1.3 per cent and an estimated cooling power of 180
microwatts. At 100 kelvin, 532-nm pumping leads to a net cooling of about 15
kelvin with a cooling efficiency of about 2.0 per cent. We attribute the net
laser cooling in cadmium sulphide nanobelts to strong coupling between excitons
and longitudinal optical phonons (LOPs), which allows the resonant annihilation
of multiple LOPs in luminescence up-conversion processes, high external quantum
efficiency and negligible background absorption. Our findings suggest that,
alternatively, group-II-VI semiconductors with strong exciton-LOP coupling could 
be harnessed to achieve laser cooling and open the way to optical refrigeration
based on semiconductors.

It is now apparent that there are at least two heating mechanisms in the Sun's
outer atmosphere, or corona. Wave heating may be the prevalent mechanism in quiet
solar periods and may contribute to heating the corona to 1,500,000 K (refs 1-3).
The active corona needs additional heating to reach 2,000,000-4,000,000 K; this
heat has been theoretically proposed to come from the reconnection and
unravelling of magnetic 'braids'. Evidence favouring that process has been
inferred, but has not been generally accepted because observations are sparse
and, in general, the braided magnetic strands that are thought to have an angular
width of about 0.2 arc seconds have not been resolved. Fine-scale braiding has
been seen in the chromosphere but not, until now, in the corona. Here we report
observations, at a resolution of 0.2 arc seconds, of magnetic braids in a coronal
active region that are reconnecting, relaxing and dissipating sufficient energy
to heat the structures to about 4,000,000 K. Although our 5-minute observations
cannot unambiguously identify the field reconnection and subsequent relaxation as
the dominant heating mechanism throughout active regions, the energy available
from the observed field relaxation in our example is ample for the observed
heating.

Efforts to extract a Greenland ice core with a complete record of the Eemian
interglacial (130,000 to 115,000 years ago) have until now been unsuccessful. The
response of the Greenland ice sheet to the warmer-than-present climate of the
Eemian has thus remained unclear. Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian 
Ice Drilling ('NEEM') ice core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the
strong warming in the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from
folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and
Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM surface
temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago) peaked at 8 ± 4
degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium, followed by a gradual
cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing summer insolation. Between
128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness of the northwest Greenland ice sheet
decreased by 400 ± 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of
130 ± 300 metres lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the
NEEM site during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again
at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional warming,
surface melt might become more common in the future.

Legislation on biofuels production in the USA and Europe is directing food crops 
towards the production of grain-based ethanol, which can have detrimental
consequences for soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate
pollution, biodiversity and human health. An alternative is to grow
lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on 'marginal' lands. Cellulosic feedstocks can
have positive environmental outcomes and could make up a substantial proportion
of future energy portfolios. However, the availability of marginal lands for
cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands
in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and
concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six
alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous
vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity
that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (-851 ± 46 grams of CO(2) equivalent
emissions per square metre per year (gCO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1))). If fertilized, these
communities have the capacity to produce about 63 ± 5 gigajoules of ethanol
energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn-soybean-wheat
rotation produces on average 41 ± 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per 
year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of -397 ± 32 gCO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1); 
a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 ± 7 gigajoules of
biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform
quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region
at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each
modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results
suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per
year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022
target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs
associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel
sustainability, such as water quality and biodiversity, await future study.

Stable creeping fault segments can become destructive as a result of dynamic
weakening.

Faults in Earth's crust accommodate slow relative motion between tectonic plates 
through either similarly slow slip or fast, seismic-wave-producing rupture events
perceived as earthquakes. These types of behaviour are often assumed to be
separated in space and to occur on two different types of fault segment: one with
stable, rate-strengthening friction and the other with rate-weakening friction
that leads to stick-slip. The 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake with moment magnitude
M(w) = 9.0 challenged such assumptions by accumulating its largest seismic slip
in the area that had been assumed to be creeping. Here we propose a model in
which stable, rate-strengthening behaviour at low slip rates is combined with
coseismic weakening due to rapid shear heating of pore fluids, allowing unstable 
slip to occur in segments that can creep between events. The model parameters are
based on laboratory measurements on samples from the fault of the M(w) 7.6 1999
Chi-Chi earthquake. The long-term slip behaviour of the model, which we examine
using a unique numerical approach that includes all wave effects, reproduces and 
explains a number of both long-term and coseismic observations-some of them
seemingly contradictory-about the faults at which the Tohoku-Oki and Chi-Chi
earthquakes occurred, including there being more high-frequency radiation from
areas of lower slip, the largest seismic slip in the Tohoku-Oki earthquake having
occurred in a potentially creeping segment, the overall pattern of previous
events in the area and the complexity of the Tohoku-Oki rupture. The implication 
that earthquake rupture may break through large portions of creeping segments,
which are at present considered to be barriers, requires a re-evaluation of
seismic hazard in many areas.

Functional and evolutionary insight from the crystal structure of rubella virus
protein E1.

Little is known about the three-dimensional organization of rubella virus, which 
causes a relatively mild measles-like disease in children but leads to serious
congenital health problems when contracted in utero. Although rubella virus
belongs to the same family as the mosquito-borne alphaviruses, in many respects
it is more similar to other aerosol-transmitted human viruses such as the agents 
of measles and mumps. Although the use of the triple MMR (measles, mumps and
rubella) live vaccine has limited its incidence in western countries, congenital 
rubella syndrome remains an important health problem in the developing world.
Here we report the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of envelope glycoprotein
E1, the main antigen and sole target of neutralizing antibodies against rubella
virus. E1 is the main player during entry into target cells owing to its
receptor-binding and membrane-fusion functions. The structure reveals the epitope
and the neutralization mechanism of an important category of protecting
antibodies against rubella infection. It also shows that rubella virus E1 is a
class II fusion protein, which had hitherto only been structurally characterized 
for the arthropod-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses. In addition, rubella virus
E1 has an extensive membrane-fusion surface that includes a metal site,
reminiscent of the T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin family of cellular proteins
that bind phosphatidylserine lipids at the plasma membrane of cells undergoing
apoptosis. Such features have not been seen in any fusion protein crystallized so
far. Structural comparisons show that the class II fusion proteins from
alphaviruses and flaviviruses, despite belonging to different virus families, are
closer to each other than they are to rubella virus E1. This suggests that the
constraints on arboviruses imposed by alternating cycles between vertebrates and 
arthropods resulted in more conservative evolution. By contrast, in the absence
of this constraint, the strictly human rubella virus seems to have drifted
considerably into a unique niche as sole member of the Rubivirus genus.

Current genomic perspectives on animal diversity neglect two prominent phyla, the
molluscs and annelids, that together account for nearly one-third of known marine
species and are important both ecologically and as experimental systems in
classical embryology. Here we describe the draft genomes of the owl limpet
(Lottia gigantea), a marine polychaete (Capitella teleta) and a freshwater leech 
(Helobdella robusta), and compare them with other animal genomes to investigate
the origin and diversification of bilaterians from a genomic perspective. We find
that the genome organization, gene structure and functional content of these
species are more similar to those of some invertebrate deuterostome genomes (for 
example, amphioxus and sea urchin) than those of other protostomes that have been
sequenced to date (flies, nematodes and flatworms). The conservation of these
genomic features enables us to expand the inventory of genes present in the last 
common bilaterian ancestor, establish the tripartite diversification of
bilaterians using multiple genomic characteristics and identify ancient conserved
long- and short-range genetic linkages across metazoans. Superimposed on this
broadly conserved pan-bilaterian background we find examples of lineage-specific 
genome evolution, including varying rates of rearrangement, intron gain and loss,
expansions and contractions of gene families, and the evolution of clade-specific
genes that produce the unique content of each genome.

Cancer cells acquire distinct metabolic adaptations to survive stress associated 
with tumour growth and to satisfy the anabolic demands of proliferation. The
tumour suppressor protein p53 (also known as TP53) influences a range of cellular
metabolic processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
glutaminolysis and anti-oxidant response. In contrast to its role in promoting
apoptosis during DNA-damaging stress, p53 can promote cell survival during
metabolic stress, a function that may contribute not only to tumour suppression
but also to non-cancer-associated functions of p53. Here we show that human
cancer cells rapidly use exogenous serine and that serine deprivation triggered
activation of the serine synthesis pathway and rapidly suppressed aerobic
glycolysis, resulting in an increased flux to the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
Transient p53-p21 (also known as CDKN1A) activation and cell-cycle arrest
promoted cell survival by efficiently channelling depleted serine stores to
glutathione synthesis, thus preserving cellular anti-oxidant capacity. Cells
lacking p53 failed to complete the response to serine depletion, resulting in
oxidative stress, reduced viability and severely impaired proliferation. The role
of p53 in supporting cancer cell proliferation under serine starvation was
translated to an in vivo model, indicating that serine depletion has a potential 
role in the treatment of p53-deficient tumours.

Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in the brain's reward circuit have 
a crucial role in mediating stress responses, including determining
susceptibility versus resilience to social-stress-induced behavioural
abnormalities. VTA dopamine neurons show two in vivo patterns of firing: low
frequency tonic firing and high frequency phasic firing. Phasic firing of the
neurons, which is well known to encode reward signals, is upregulated by repeated
social-defeat stress, a highly validated mouse model of depression. Surprisingly,
this pathophysiological effect is seen in susceptible mice only, with no apparent
change in firing rate in resilient individuals. However, direct evidence--in real
time--linking dopamine neuron phasic firing in promoting the susceptible
(depression-like) phenotype is lacking. Here we took advantage of the temporal
precision and cell-type and projection-pathway specificity of optogenetics to
show that enhanced phasic firing of these neurons mediates susceptibility to
social-defeat stress in freely behaving mice. We show that optogenetic induction 
of phasic, but not tonic, firing in VTA dopamine neurons of mice undergoing a
subthreshold social-defeat paradigm rapidly induced a susceptible phenotype as
measured by social avoidance and decreased sucrose preference. Optogenetic phasic
stimulation of these neurons also quickly induced a susceptible phenotype in
previously resilient mice that had been subjected to repeated social-defeat
stress. Furthermore, we show differences in projection-pathway specificity in
promoting stress susceptibility: phasic activation of VTA neurons projecting to
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
induced susceptibility to social-defeat stress. Conversely, optogenetic
inhibition of the VTA-NAc projection induced resilience, whereas inhibition of
the VTA-mPFC projection promoted susceptibility. Overall, these studies reveal
novel firing-pattern- and neural-circuit-specific mechanisms of depression.

Lung epithelial cells can influence immune responses to airway allergens. Airway 
epithelial cells also undergo apoptosis after encountering environmental
allergens; yet, relatively little is known about how these are cleared, and their
effect on airway inflammation. Here we show that airway epithelial cells
efficiently engulf apoptotic epithelial cells and secrete anti-inflammatory
cytokines, dependent upon intracellular signalling by the small GTPase Rac1.
Inducible deletion of Rac1 expression specifically in airway epithelial cells in 
a mouse model resulted in defective engulfment by epithelial cells and aberrant
anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal priming and challenge of these 
mice with house dust mite extract or ovalbumin as allergens led to exacerbated
inflammation, augmented Th2 cytokines and airway hyper-responsiveness, with
decreased interleukin (IL)-10 in bronchial lavages. Rac1-deficient epithelial
cells produced much higher IL-33 upon allergen or apoptotic cell encounter, with 
increased numbers of nuocyte-like cells. Administration of exogenous IL-10
'rescued' the airway inflammation phenotype in Rac1-deficient mice, with
decreased IL-33. Collectively, these genetic and functional studies suggest a new
role for Rac1-dependent engulfment by airway epithelial cells and in establishing
the anti-inflammatory environment, and that defects in cell clearance in the
airways could contribute to inflammatory responses towards common allergens.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is thought to be an
important cellular mechanism underlying memory formation. A widely accepted model
posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA
(α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1.
To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse
CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement
strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In
contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for
LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an
artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The
only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased
AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of 
receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to
potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental
change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying
synaptic plasticity.

The introduction of dairying was a critical step in early agriculture, with milk 
products being rapidly adopted as a major component of the diets of prehistoric
farmers and pottery-using late hunter-gatherers. The processing of milk,
particularly the production of cheese, would have been a critical development
because it not only allowed the preservation of milk products in a non-perishable
and transportable form, but also it made milk a more digestible commodity for
early prehistoric farmers. The finding of abundant milk residues in pottery
vessels from seventh millennium sites from north-western Anatolia provided the
earliest evidence of milk processing, although the exact practice could not be
explicitly defined. Notably, the discovery of potsherds pierced with small holes 
appear at early Neolithic sites in temperate Europe in the sixth millennium BC
and have been interpreted typologically as 'cheese-strainers', although a direct 
association with milk processing has not yet been demonstrated. Organic residues 
preserved in pottery vessels have provided direct evidence for early milk use in 
the Neolithic period in the Near East and south-eastern Europe, north Africa,
Denmark and the British Isles, based on the δ(13)C and Δ(13)C values of the major
fatty acids in milk. Here we apply the same approach to investigate the function 
of sieves/strainer vessels, providing direct chemical evidence for their use in
milk processing. The presence of abundant milk fat in these specialized vessels, 
comparable in form to modern cheese strainers, provides compelling evidence for
the vessels having being used to separate fat-rich milk curds from the
lactose-containing whey. This new evidence emphasizes the importance of pottery
vessels in processing dairy products, particularly in the manufacture of
reduced-lactose milk products among lactose-intolerant prehistoric farming
communities.

Major depression is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include
hopelessness and anhedonia. Dopamine neurons involved in reward and motivation
are among many neural populations that have been hypothesized to be relevant, and
certain antidepressant treatments, including medications and brain stimulation
therapies, can influence the complex dopamine system. Until now it has not been
possible to test this hypothesis directly, even in animal models, as existing
therapeutic interventions are unable to specifically target dopamine neurons.
Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine
neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild
stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and
electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that
bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine
neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple 
independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit 
implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of
these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related 
behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents,
suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations
in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry.

Ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, including TET1, TET2 and TET3, convert
5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and regulate gene transcription.
However, the molecular mechanism by which TET family enzymes regulate gene
transcription remains elusive. Using protein affinity purification, here we
search for functional partners of TET proteins, and find that TET2 and TET3
associate with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), an
enzyme that by itself catalyses the addition of O-GlcNAc onto serine and
threonine residues (O-GlcNAcylation) in vivo. TET2 directly interacts with OGT,
which is important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this
specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2, it
facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT associates with 
TET2 at transcription start sites. Downregulation of TET2 reduces the amount of
histone 2B Ser 112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which are associated with gene
transcription regulation. Taken together, these results reveal a TET2-dependent
O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin. The double epigenetic modifications on both DNA and
histones by TET2 and OGT coordinate together for the regulation of gene
transcription.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in which small interfering RNAs 
(siRNAs) guide the degradation of cognate RNAs, but also promote heterochromatin 
assembly at repetitive DNA elements such as centromeric repeats. However, the
full extent of RNAi functions and its endogenous targets have not been explored. 
Here we show that, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, RNAi and
heterochromatin factors cooperate to silence diverse loci, including sexual
differentiation genes, genes encoding transmembrane proteins, and
retrotransposons that are also targeted by the exosome RNA degradation machinery.
In the absence of the exosome, transcripts are processed preferentially by the
RNAi machinery, revealing siRNA clusters and a corresponding increase in
heterochromatin modifications across large domains containing genes and
retrotransposons. We show that the generation of siRNAs and heterochromatin
assembly by RNAi is triggered by a mechanism involving the canonical poly(A)
polymerase Pla1 and an associated RNA surveillance factor Red1, which also
activate the exosome. Notably, siRNA production and heterochromatin modifications
at these target loci are regulated by environmental growth conditions, and by
developmental signals that induce gene expression during sexual differentiation. 
Our analyses uncover an interaction between RNAi and the exosome that is
conserved in Drosophila, and show that differentiation signals modulate RNAi
silencing to regulate developmental genes.

Relative to morphological traits, we know little about how genetics influence the
evolution of complex behavioural differences in nature. It is unclear how the
environment influences natural variation in heritable behaviour, and whether
complex behavioural differences evolve through few genetic changes, each
affecting many aspects of behaviour, or through the accumulation of several
genetic changes that, when combined, give rise to behavioural complexity. Here we
show that in nature, oldfield mice (Peromyscus polionotus) build complex burrows 
with long entrance and escape tunnels, and that burrow length is consistent
across populations, although burrow depth varies with soil composition. This
burrow architecture is in contrast with the small, simple burrows of its sister
species, deer mice (P. maniculatus). When investigated under laboratory
conditions, both species recapitulate their natural burrowing behaviour. Genetic 
crosses between the two species reveal that the derived burrows of oldfield mice 
are dominant and evolved through the addition of multiple genetic changes. In
burrows built by first-generation backcross mice, entrance-tunnel length and the 
presence of an escape tunnel can be uncoupled, suggesting that these traits are
modular. Quantitative trait locus analysis also indicates that tunnel length
segregates as a complex trait, affected by at least three independent genetic
regions, whereas the presence of an escape tunnel is associated with only a
single locus. Together, these results suggest that complex behaviours--in this
case, a classic 'extended phenotype'--can evolve through multiple genetic changes
each affecting distinct behaviour modules.

The recent decades-long decline in East African rainfall suggests that
multidecadal variability is an important component of the climate of this
vulnerable region. Prior work based on analysing the instrumental record
implicates both Indian and Pacific ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as
possible drivers of East African multidecadal climate variability, but the short 
length of the instrumental record precludes a full elucidation of the underlying 
physical mechanisms. Here we show that on timescales beyond the decadal, the
Indian Ocean drives East African rainfall variability by altering the local
Walker circulation, whereas the influence of the Pacific Ocean is minimal. Our
results, based on proxy indicators of relative moisture balance for the past
millennium paired with long control simulations from coupled climate models,
reveal that moist conditions in coastal East Africa are associated with cool SSTs
(and related descending circulation) in the eastern Indian Ocean and ascending
circulation over East Africa. The most prominent event identified in the proxy
record--a coastal pluvial from 1680 to 1765--occurred when Indo-Pacific warm pool
SSTs reached their minimum values of the past millennium. Taken together, the
proxy and model evidence suggests that Indian Ocean SSTs are the primary
influence on East African rainfall over multidecadal and perhaps longer
timescales.

Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a well known superhard material that has a wide
range of industrial applications. Nanostructuring of cBN is an effective way to
improve its hardness by virtue of the Hall-Petch effect--the tendency for
hardness to increase with decreasing grain size. Polycrystalline cBN materials
are often synthesized by using the martensitic transformation of a graphite-like 
BN precursor, in which high pressures and temperatures lead to puckering of the
BN layers. Such approaches have led to synthetic polycrystalline cBN having grain
sizes as small as ∼14 nm (refs 1, 2, 4, 5). Here we report the formation of cBN
with a nanostructure dominated by fine twin domains of average thickness ∼3.8 nm.
This nanotwinned cBN was synthesized from specially prepared BN precursor
nanoparticles possessing onion-like nested structures with intrinsically puckered
BN layers and numerous stacking faults. The resulting nanotwinned cBN bulk
samples are optically transparent with a striking combination of physical
properties: an extremely high Vickers hardness (exceeding 100 GPa, the optimal
hardness of synthetic diamond), a high oxidization temperature (∼1,294 °C) and a 
large fracture toughness (>12 MPa m(1/2), well beyond the toughness of commercial
cemented tungsten carbide, ∼10 MPa m(1/2)). We show that hardening of cBN is
continuous with decreasing twin thickness down to the smallest sizes
investigated, contrasting with the expected reverse Hall-Petch effect below a
critical grain size or the twin thickness of ∼10-15 nm found in metals and
alloys.

Fanconi anaemia and the repair of Watson and Crick DNA crosslinks.

Kottemann MC(1), Smogorzewska A.

Author information: 
(1)Laboratory of Genome Maintenance, The Rockefeller University, New York 10065, 
USA.

The function of Fanconi anaemia proteins is to maintain genomic stability. Their 
main role is in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, which, by covalently
binding the Watson and the Crick strands of DNA, impede replication and
transcription. Inappropriate repair of interstrand crosslinks causes genomic
instability, leading to cancer; conversely, the toxicity of crosslinking agents
makes them a powerful chemotherapeutic. Fanconi anaemia proteins can promote
stem-cell function, prevent tumorigenesis, stabilize replication forks and
inhibit inaccurate repair. Recent advances have identified endogenous aldehydes
as possible culprits of DNA damage that may induce the phenotypes seen in
patients with Fanconi anaemia.

Metabolism of inflammation limited by AMPK and pseudo-starvation.

Metabolic changes in cells that participate in inflammation, such as activated
macrophages and T-helper 17 cells, include a shift towards enhanced glucose
uptake, glycolysis and increased activity of the pentose phosphate pathway.
Opposing roles in these changes for hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and AMP-activated
protein kinase have been proposed. By contrast, anti-inflammatory cells, such as 
M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells and quiescent memory T cells, have lower
glycolytic rates and higher levels of oxidative metabolism. Some
anti-inflammatory agents might act by inducing, through activation of
AMP-activated protein kinase, a state akin to pseudo-starvation. Altered
metabolism may thus participate in the signal-directed programs that promote or
inhibit inflammation.

mTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, 
USA.

Many experts in the biology of ageing believe that pharmacological interventions 
to slow ageing are a matter of 'when' rather than 'if'. A leading target for such
interventions is the nutrient response pathway defined by the mechanistic target 
of rapamycin (mTOR). Inhibition of this pathway extends lifespan in model
organisms and confers protection against a growing list of age-related
pathologies. Characterized inhibitors of this pathway are already clinically
approved, and others are under development. Although adverse side effects
currently preclude use in otherwise healthy individuals, drugs that target the
mTOR pathway could one day become widely used to slow ageing and reduce
age-related pathologies in humans.

Activity-dependent neuronal signalling and autism spectrum disorder.

Ebert DH(1), Greenberg ME.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts
02115, USA.

Neuronal activity induces the post-translational modification of synaptic
molecules, promotes localized protein synthesis within dendrites and activates
gene transcription, thereby regulating synaptic function and allowing neuronal
circuits to respond dynamically to experience. Evidence indicates that many of
the genes that are mutated in autism spectrum disorder are crucial components of 
the activity-dependent signalling networks that regulate synapse development and 
plasticity. Dysregulation of activity-dependent signalling pathways in neurons
may, therefore, have a key role in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorder.

Our knowledge of the principles by which organ architecture develops through
complex collective cell behaviours is still limited. Recent work has shown that
the shape of such complex tissues as the optic cup forms by self-organization in 
vitro from a homogeneous population of stem cells. Multicellular
self-organization involves three basic processes that are crucial for the
emergence of latent intrinsic order. Based on lessons from recent studies,
cytosystems dynamics is proposed as a strategy for understanding collective
multicellular behaviours, incorporating four-dimensional measurement, theoretical
modelling and experimental reconstitution.

Understanding the links between long-term biological evolution, the
ocean-atmosphere system and plate tectonics is a central goal of Earth science.
Although environmental perturbations of many different kinds are known to have
affected long-term biological evolution, particularly during major mass
extinction events, the relative importance of physical environmental factors
versus biological interactions in governing rates of extinction and origination
through geological time remains unknown. Here we use macrostratigraphic data from
the Atlantic Ocean basin to show that changes in global species diversity and
rates of extinction among planktonic foraminifera have been linked to
tectonically and climatically forced changes in ocean circulation and chemistry
from the Jurassic period to the present. Transient environmental perturbations,
such as those that occurred after the asteroid impact at the end of the
Cretaceous period approximately 66 million years ago, and the Eocene/Oligocene
greenhouse-icehouse transition approximately 34 million years ago, are
superimposed on this general long-term relationship. Rates of species
origination, by contrast, are not correlated with corresponding
macrostratigraphic quantities, indicating that physiochemical changes in the
ocean-atmosphere system affect evolution principally by driving the synchronous
extinction of lineages that originated owing to more protracted and complex
interactions between biological and environmental factors.

High (3)He/(4)He ratios in some basalts have generally been interpreted as
originating in an incompletely degassed lower-mantle source. This helium source
may have been isolated at the core-mantle boundary region since Earth's
accretion. Alternatively, it may have taken part in whole-mantle convection and
crust production over the age of the Earth; if so, it is now either a primitive
refugium at the core-mantle boundary or is distributed throughout the lower
mantle. Here we constrain the problem using lavas from Baffin Island, West
Greenland, the Ontong Java Plateau, Isla Gorgona and Fernandina (Galapagos).
Olivine phenocryst compositions show that these lavas originated from a
peridotite source that was about 20 per cent higher in nickel content than in the
modern mid-ocean-ridge basalt source. Where data are available, these lavas also 
have high (3)He/(4)He. We propose that a less-degassed nickel-rich source formed 
by core-mantle interaction during the crystallization of a melt-rich layer or
basal magma ocean, and that this source continues to be sampled by mantle plumes.
The spatial distribution of this source may be constrained by nickel partitioning
experiments at the pressures of the core-mantle boundary.

Planetary system disruption by Galactic perturbations to wide binary stars.

Nearly half the exoplanets found within binary star systems reside in very wide
binaries with average stellar separations greater than 1,000 astronomical units
(one astronomical unit (AU) being the Earth-Sun distance), yet the influence of
such distant binary companions on planetary evolution remains largely unstudied. 
Unlike their tighter counterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries
continually change under the influence of the Milky Way's tidal field and
impulses from other passing stars. Here we report numerical simulations
demonstrating that the variable nature of wide binary star orbits dramatically
reshapes the planetary systems they host, typically billions of years after
formation. Contrary to previous understanding, wide binary companions may often
strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetary ejections and increasing
the orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. Although hitherto not
recognized, orbits of giant exoplanets within wide binaries are statistically
more eccentric than those around isolated stars. Both eccentricity distributions 
are well reproduced when we assume that isolated stars and wide binaries host
similar planetary systems whose outermost giant planets are scattered beyond
about 10 AU from their parent stars by early internal instabilities.
Consequently, our results suggest that although wide binaries eventually remove
the most distant planets from many planetary systems, most isolated giant
exoplanet systems harbour additional distant, still undetected planets.

Pulsed accretion in a variable protostar.

Periodic increases in luminosity arising from variable accretion rates have been 
predicted for some pre-main-sequence close binary stars as they grow from
circumbinary disks. The phenomenon is known as pulsed accretion and can affect
the orbital evolution and mass distribution of young binaries, as well as the
potential for planet formation. Accretion variability is a common feature of
young stars, with a large range of amplitudes and timescales as measured from
multi-epoch observations at optical and infrared wavelengths. Periodic variations
consistent with pulsed accretion have been seen in only a few young binaries via 
optical accretion tracers, albeit intermittently with accretion luminosity
variations ranging from zero to 50 per cent from orbit to orbit. Here we report
that the infrared luminosity of a young protostar (of age about 10(5) years)
increases by a factor of ten in roughly one week every 25.34 days. We attribute
this to pulsed accretion associated with an unseen binary companion. The strength
and regularity of this accretion signal is surprising; it may be related to the
very young age of the system, which is a factor of ten younger than the other
pulsed accretors previously studied.

Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form of synaptic plasticity,
has long been postulated as a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Although
LTP can persist for long periods of time, the mechanisms underlying LTP
maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity,
remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC)
isoform protein kinase M-ζ (PKM-ζ) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP
maintenance and long-term memory. Inhibiting PKM-ζ activity using a synthetic
zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate sequence
reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo. More notably, infusion of ZIP
eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours,
including active place avoidance, conditioned taste aversion, fear conditioning
and spatial learning. However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-ζ
in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-ζ by ZIP.
To further investigate the involvement of PKM-ζ in the maintenance of LTP and
memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-ζ and PKM-ζ. We find that both
conventional and conditional PKC-ζ/PKM-ζ knockout mice show normal synaptic
transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in
several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still
reverses LTP in PKC-ζ/PKM-ζ knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are
independent of PKM-ζ.

Protein kinase M-ζ (PKM-ζ) is a constitutively active form of atypical protein
kinase C that is exclusively expressed in the brain and implicated in the
maintenance of long-term memory. Most studies that support a role for PKM-ζ in
memory maintenance have used pharmacological PKM-ζ inhibitors such as the
myristoylated zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) or chelerythrine. Here we use a
genetic approach and target exon 9 of the Prkcz gene to generate mice that lack
both protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) and PKM-ζ (Prkcz(-/-) mice). Prkcz(-/-) mice
showed normal behaviour in a cage environment and in baseline tests of motor
function and sensory perception, but displayed reduced anxiety-like behaviour.
Notably, Prkcz(-/-) mice did not show deficits in learning or memory in tests of 
cued fear conditioning, novel object recognition, object location recognition,
conditioned place preference for cocaine, or motor learning, when compared with
wild-type littermates. ZIP injection into the nucleus accumbens reduced
expression of cocaine-conditioned place preference in Prkcz(-/-) mice. In vitro, 
ZIP and scrambled ZIP inhibited PKM-ζ, PKC-ι and PKC-ζ with similar inhibition
constant (K(i)) values. Chelerythrine was a weak inhibitor of PKM-ζ (K(i) =
76 μM). Our findings show that absence of PKM-ζ does not impair learning and
memory in mice, and that ZIP can erase reward memory even when PKM-ζ is not
present.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are an early onset, heterogeneous group of
heritable neuropsychiatric disorders with symptoms that include deficits in
social interaction skills, impaired communication abilities, and ritualistic-like
repetitive behaviours. One of the hypotheses for a common molecular mechanism
underlying ASDs is altered translational control resulting in exaggerated protein
synthesis. Genetic variants in chromosome 4q, which contains the EIF4E locus,
have been described in patients with autism. Importantly, a rare single
nucleotide polymorphism has been identified in autism that is associated with
increased promoter activity in the EIF4E gene. Here we show that genetically
increasing the levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in
mice results in exaggerated cap-dependent translation and aberrant behaviours
reminiscent of autism, including repetitive and perseverative behaviours and
social interaction deficits. Moreover, these autistic-like behaviours are
accompanied by synaptic pathophysiology in the medial prefrontal cortex, striatum
and hippocampus. The autistic-like behaviours displayed by the eIF4E-transgenic
mice are corrected by intracerebroventricular infusions of the cap-dependent
translation inhibitor 4EGI-1. Our findings demonstrate a causal relationship
between exaggerated cap-dependent translation, synaptic dysfunction and aberrant 
behaviours associated with autism.

Asymmetric neurotransmitter release enables rapid odour lateralization in
Drosophila.

In Drosophila, most individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) project
bilaterally to both sides of the brain. Having bilateral rather than unilateral
projections may represent a useful redundancy. However, bilateral ORN projections
to the brain should also compromise the ability to lateralize odours.
Nevertheless, walking or flying Drosophila reportedly turn towards the antenna
that is more strongly stimulated by odour. Here we show that each ORN spike
releases approximately 40% more neurotransmitter from the axon branch ipsilateral
to the soma than from the contralateral branch. As a result, when an odour
activates the antennae asymmetrically, ipsilateral central neurons begin to spike
a few milliseconds before contralateral neurons, and at a 30 to 50% higher rate
than contralateral neurons. We show that a walking fly can detect a 5% asymmetry 
in total ORN input to its left and right antennal lobes, and can turn towards the
odour in less time than it requires the fly to complete a stride. These results
demonstrate that neurotransmitter release properties can be tuned independently
at output synapses formed by a single axon onto two target cells with identical
functions and morphologies. Our data also show that small differences in spike
timing and spike rate can produce reliable differences in olfactory behaviour.

The properties of all materials arise largely from the quantum mechanics of their
constituent electrons under the influence of the electric field of the nuclei.
The solution of the underlying many-electron Schrödinger equation is a
'non-polynomial hard' problem, owing to the complex interplay of kinetic energy, 
electron-electron repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle. The dominant
computational method for describing such systems has been density functional
theory. Quantum-chemical methods--based on an explicit ansatz for the
many-electron wavefunctions and, hence, potentially more accurate--have not been 
fully explored in the solid state owing to their computational complexity, which 
ranges from strongly exponential to high-order polynomial in system size. Here we
report the application of an exact technique, full configuration interaction
quantum Monte Carlo to a variety of real solids, providing reference
many-electron energies that are used to rigorously benchmark the standard
hierarchy of quantum-chemical techniques, up to the 'gold standard'
coupled-cluster ansatz, including single, double and perturbative triple
particle-hole excitation operators. We show the errors in cohesive energies
predicted by this method to be small, indicating the potential of this
computationally polynomial scaling technique to tackle current solid-state
problems.

Improved sequencing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for
investigating the role of rare genetic variation in common disease. However,
there are considerable challenges with respect to study design, data analysis and
replication. Using pooled next-generation sequencing of 507 genes implicated in
the repair of DNA in 1,150 samples, an analytical strategy focused on
protein-truncating variants (PTVs) and a large-scale sequencing case-control
replication experiment in 13,642 individuals, here we show that rare PTVs in the 
p53-inducible protein phosphatase PPM1D are associated with predisposition to
breast cancer and ovarian cancer. PPM1D PTV mutations were present in 25 out of
7,781 cases versus 1 out of 5,861 controls (P = 1.12 × 10(-5)), including 18
mutations in 6,912 individuals with breast cancer (P = 2.42 × 10(-4)) and 12
mutations in 1,121 individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 3.10 × 10(-9)). Notably, 
all of the identified PPM1D PTVs were mosaic in lymphocyte DNA and clustered
within a 370-base-pair region in the final exon of the gene, carboxy-terminal to 
the phosphatase catalytic domain. Functional studies demonstrate that the
mutations result in enhanced suppression of p53 in response to ionizing radiation
exposure, suggesting that the mutant alleles encode hyperactive PPM1D isoforms.
Thus, although the mutations cause premature protein truncation, they do not
result in the simple loss-of-function effect typically associated with this class
of variant, but instead probably have a gain-of-function effect. Our results have
implications for the detection and management of breast and ovarian cancer risk. 
More generally, these data provide new insights into the role of rare and of
mosaic genetic variants in common conditions, and the use of sequencing in their 
identification.

A widespread system used by bacteria for protection against potentially dangerous
foreign DNA molecules consists of the clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) coupled with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes. Similar 
to RNA interference in eukaryotes, these CRISPR/Cas systems use small RNAs for
sequence-specific detection and neutralization of invading genomes. Here we
describe the first examples of genes that mediate the inhibition of a CRISPR/Cas 
system. Five distinct 'anti-CRISPR' genes were found in the genomes of
bacteriophages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mutation of the anti-CRISPR gene
of a phage rendered it unable to infect bacteria with a functional CRISPR/Cas
system, and the addition of the same gene to the genome of a CRISPR/Cas-targeted 
phage allowed it to evade the CRISPR/Cas system. Phage-encoded anti-CRISPR genes 
may represent a widespread mechanism for phages to overcome the highly prevalent 
CRISPR/Cas systems. The existence of anti-CRISPR genes presents new avenues for
the elucidation of CRISPR/Cas functional mechanisms and provides new insight into
the co-evolution of phages and bacteria.

Although recent studies have revealed that heart cells are generated in adult
mammals, the frequency of generation and the source of new heart cells are not
yet known. Some studies suggest a high rate of stem cell activity with
differentiation of progenitors to cardiomyocytes. Other studies suggest that new 
cardiomyocytes are born at a very low rate, and that they may be derived from the
division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. Here we show, by combining two different
pulse-chase approaches--genetic fate-mapping with stable isotope labelling, and
multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry--that the genesis of cardiomyocytes
occurs at a low rate by the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes during normal
ageing, a process that increases adjacent to areas of myocardial injury. We found
that cell cycle activity during normal ageing and after injury led to polyploidy 
and multinucleation, but also to new diploid, mononucleate cardiomyocytes. These 
data reveal pre-existing cardiomyocytes as the dominant source of cardiomyocyte
replacement in normal mammalian myocardial homeostasis as well as after
myocardial injury.

Hyperconnectivity of neuronal circuits due to increased synaptic protein
synthesis is thought to cause autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is strongly implicated in ASDs by means of upstream
signalling; however, downstream regulatory mechanisms are ill-defined. Here we
show that knockout of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding
protein 2 (4E-BP2)-an eIF4E repressor downstream of mTOR-or eIF4E overexpression 
leads to increased translation of neuroligins, which are postsynaptic proteins
that are causally linked to ASDs. Mice that have the gene encoding 4E-BP2
(Eif4ebp2) knocked out exhibit an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory
synaptic inputs and autistic-like behaviours (that is, social interaction
deficits, altered communication and repetitive/stereotyped behaviours).
Pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E activity or normalization of neuroligin 1,
but not neuroligin 2, protein levels restores the normal excitation/inhibition
ratio and rectifies the social behaviour deficits. Thus, translational control by
eIF4E regulates the synthesis of neuroligins, maintaining the
excitation-to-inhibition balance, and its dysregulation engenders ASD-like
phenotypes.

complex.

The general transcription factor (TF) IIB is required for RNA polymerase (Pol) II
initiation and extends with its B-reader element into the Pol II active centre
cleft. Low-resolution structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex indicated how TFIIB 
functions in DNA recruitment, but they lacked nucleic acids and half of the
B-reader, leaving other TFIIB functions enigmatic. Here we report crystal
structures of the Pol II-TFIIB complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at
3.4 Å resolution and of an initially transcribing complex that additionally
contains the DNA template and a 6-nucleotide RNA product. The structures reveal
the entire B-reader and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and together with
functional data lead to a more complete understanding of transcription
initiation. TFIIB partially closes the polymerase cleft to position DNA and
assist in its opening. The B-reader does not reach the active site but binds the 
DNA template strand upstream to assist in the recognition of the initiator
sequence and in positioning the transcription start site. TFIIB rearranges
active-site residues, induces binding of the catalytic metal ion B, and
stimulates initial RNA synthesis allosterically. TFIIB then prevents the emerging
DNA-RNA hybrid duplex from tilting, which would impair RNA synthesis. When the
RNA grows beyond 6 nucleotides, it is separated from DNA and is directed to its
exit tunnel by the B-reader loop. Once the RNA grows to 12-13 nucleotides, it
clashes with TFIIB, triggering TFIIB displacement and elongation complex
formation. Similar mechanisms may underlie all cellular transcription because all
eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerases use TFIIB-like factors, and the bacterial
initiation factor sigma has TFIIB-like topology and contains the loop region 3.2 
that resembles the B-reader loop in location, charge and function. TFIIB and its 
counterparts may thus account for the two fundamental properties that distinguish
RNA from DNA polymerases: primer-independent chain initiation and product
separation from the template.

Insulin receptor signalling has a central role in mammalian biology, regulating
cellular metabolism, growth, division, differentiation and survival. Insulin
resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the
onset of Alzheimer's disease; aberrant signalling occurs in diverse cancers,
exacerbated by cross-talk with the homologous type 1 insulin-like growth factor
receptor (IGF1R). Despite more than three decades of investigation, the
three-dimensional structure of the insulin-insulin receptor complex has proved
elusive, confounded by the complexity of producing the receptor protein. Here we 
present the first view, to our knowledge, of the interaction of insulin with its 
primary binding site on the insulin receptor, on the basis of four crystal
structures of insulin bound to truncated insulin receptor constructs. The direct 
interaction of insulin with the first leucine-rich-repeat domain (L1) of insulin 
receptor is seen to be sparse, the hormone instead engaging the insulin receptor 
carboxy-terminal α-chain (αCT) segment, which is itself remodelled on the face of
L1 upon insulin binding. Contact between insulin and L1 is restricted to insulin 
B-chain residues. The αCT segment displaces the B-chain C-terminal β-strand away 
from the hormone core, revealing the mechanism of a long-proposed conformational 
switch in insulin upon receptor engagement. This mode of hormone-receptor
recognition is novel within the broader family of receptor tyrosine kinases. We
support these findings by photo-crosslinking data that place the suggested
interactions into the context of the holoreceptor and by isothermal titration
calorimetry data that dissect the hormone-insulin receptor interface. Together,
our findings provide an explanation for a wealth of biochemical data from the
insulin receptor and IGF1R systems relevant to the design of therapeutic insulin 
analogues.

The onset of melting in the Earth's upper mantle influences the thermal evolution
of the planet, fluxes of key volatiles to the exosphere, and geochemical and
geophysical properties of the mantle. Although carbonatitic melt could be stable 
250 km or less beneath mid-oceanic ridges, owing to the small fraction (∼0.03
wt%) its effects on the mantle properties are unclear. Geophysical measurements, 
however, suggest that melts of greater volume may be present at ∼200 km (refs
3-5) but large melt fractions are thought to be restricted to shallower depths.
Here we present experiments on carbonated peridotites over 2-5 GPa that constrain
the location and the slope of the onset of silicate melting in the mantle. We
find that the pressure-temperature slope of carbonated silicate melting is
steeper than the solidus of volatile-free peridotite and that silicate melting of
dry peridotite + CO(2) beneath ridges commences at ∼180 km. Accounting for the
effect of 50-200 p.p.m. H(2)O on freezing point depression, the onset of silicate
melting for a sub-ridge mantle with ∼100 p.p.m. CO(2) becomes as deep as
∼220-300 km. We suggest that, on a global scale, carbonated silicate melt
generation at a redox front ∼250-200 km deep, with destabilization of metal and
majorite in the upwelling mantle, explains the oceanic low-velocity zone and the 
electrical conductivity structure of the mantle. In locally oxidized domains,
deeper carbonated silicate melt may contribute to the seismic X-discontinuity.
Furthermore, our results, along with the electrical conductivity of molten
carbonated peridotite and that of the oceanic upper mantle, suggest that mantle
at depth is CO(2)-rich but H(2)O-poor. Finally, carbonated silicate melts
restrict the stability of carbonatite in the Earth's deep upper mantle, and the
inventory of carbon, H(2)O and other highly incompatible elements at ridges
becomes controlled by the flux of the former.

Landscapes modified by glacial erosion show a distinct distribution of surface
area with elevation (hypsometry). In particular, the height of these regions is
influenced by climatic gradients controlling the altitude where glacial and
periglacial processes are the most active, and as a result, surface area is
focused just below the snowline altitude. Yet the effect of this distinct glacial
hypsometric signature on glacial extent and therefore on continued glacial
erosion has not previously been examined. Here we show how this topographic
configuration influences the climatic sensitivity of Alpine glaciers, and how the
development of a glacial hypsometric distribution influences the intensity of
glaciations on timescales of more than a few glacial cycles. We find that the
relationship between variations in climate and the resulting variation in areal
extent of glaciation changes drastically with the degree of glacial modification 
in the landscape. First, in landscapes with novel glaciations, a nearly linear
relationship between climate and glacial area exists. Second, in previously
glaciated landscapes with extensive area at a similar elevation, highly nonlinear
and rapid glacial expansions occur with minimal climate forcing, once the
snowline reaches the hypsometric maximum. Our results also show that erosion
associated with glaciations before the mid-Pleistocene transition at around
950,000 years ago probably preconditioned the landscape--producing glacial
landforms and hypsometric maxima--such that ongoing cooling led to a significant 
change in glacial extent and erosion, resulting in more extensive glaciations and
valley deepening in the late Pleistocene epoch. We thus provide a mechanism that 
explains previous observations from exposure dating and low-temperature
thermochronology in the European Alps, and suggest that there is a strong
topographic control on the most recent Quaternary period glaciations.

Electromagnetic phased arrays at radio frequencies are well known and have
enabled applications ranging from communications to radar, broadcasting and
astronomy. The ability to generate arbitrary radiation patterns with large-scale 
phased arrays has long been pursued. Although it is extremely expensive and
cumbersome to deploy large-scale radiofrequency phased arrays, optical phased
arrays have a unique advantage in that the much shorter optical wavelength holds 
promise for large-scale integration. However, the short optical wavelength also
imposes stringent requirements on fabrication. As a consequence, although optical
phased arrays have been studied with various platforms and recently with
chip-scale nanophotonics, all of the demonstrations so far are restricted to
one-dimensional or small-scale two-dimensional arrays. Here we report the
demonstration of a large-scale two-dimensional nanophotonic phased array (NPA),
in which 64 × 64 (4,096) optical nanoantennas are densely integrated on a silicon
chip within a footprint of 576 μm × 576 μm with all of the nanoantennas precisely
balanced in power and aligned in phase to generate a designed, sophisticated
radiation pattern in the far field. We also show that active phase tunability can
be realized in the proposed NPA by demonstrating dynamic beam steering and
shaping with an 8 × 8 array. This work demonstrates that a robust design,
together with state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
technology, allows large-scale NPAs to be implemented on compact and inexpensive 
nanophotonic chips. In turn, this enables arbitrary radiation pattern generation 
using NPAs and therefore extends the functionalities of phased arrays beyond
conventional beam focusing and steering, opening up possibilities for large-scale
deployment in applications such as communication, laser detection and ranging,
three-dimensional holography and biomedical sciences, to name just a few.

The formation of gaseous giant planets is thought to occur in the first few
million years after stellar birth. Models predict that the process produces a
deep gap in the dust component (shallower in the gas). Infrared observations of
the disk around the young star HD 142527 (at a distance of about 140 parsecs from
Earth) found an inner disk about 10 astronomical units (AU) in radius (1 AU is
the Earth-Sun distance), surrounded by a particularly large gap and a disrupted
outer disk beyond 140 AU. This disruption is indicative of a perturbing
planetary-mass body at about 90 AU. Radio observations indicate that the bulk
mass is molecular and lies in the outer disk, whose continuum emission has a
horseshoe morphology. The high stellar accretion rate would deplete the inner
disk in less than one year, and to sustain the observed accretion matter must
therefore flow from the outer disk and cross the gap. In dynamical models, the
putative protoplanets channel outer-disk material into gap-crossing bridges that 
feed stellar accretion through the inner disk. Here we report observations of
diffuse CO gas inside the gap, with denser HCO(+) gas along gap-crossing
filaments. The estimated flow rate of the gas is in the range of 7 × 10(-9) to
2 × 10(-7) solar masses per year, which is sufficient to maintain accretion onto 
the star at the present rate.

Smoke, fog, jelly, paints, milk and shaving cream are common everyday examples of
colloids, a type of soft matter consisting of tiny particles dispersed in
chemically distinct host media. Being abundant in nature, colloids also find
increasingly important applications in science and technology, ranging from
direct probing of kinetics in crystals and glasses to fabrication of
third-generation quantum-dot solar cells. Because naturally occurring colloids
have a shape that is typically determined by minimization of interfacial tension 
(for example, during phase separation) or faceted crystal growth, their surfaces 
tend to have minimum-area spherical or topologically equivalent shapes such as
prisms and irregular grains (all continuously deformable--homeomorphic--to
spheres). Although toroidal DNA condensates and vesicles with different numbers
of handles can exist and soft matter defects can be shaped as rings and knots,
the role of particle topology in colloidal systems remains unexplored. Here we
fabricate and study colloidal particles with different numbers of handles and
genus g ranging from 1 to 5. When introduced into a nematic liquid crystal--a
fluid made of rod-like molecules that spontaneously align along the so-called
'director'--these particles induce three-dimensional director fields and
topological defects dictated by colloidal topology. Whereas electric fields,
photothermal melting and laser tweezing cause transformations between
configurations of particle-induced structures, three-dimensional nonlinear
optical imaging reveals that topological charge is conserved and that the total
charge of particle-induced defects always obeys predictions of the Gauss-Bonnet
and Poincaré-Hopf index theorems. This allows us to establish and experimentally 
test the procedure for assignment and summation of topological charges in
three-dimensional director fields. Our findings lay the groundwork for new
applications of colloids and liquid crystals that range from topological memory
devices, through new types of self-assembly, to the experimental study of
low-dimensional topology.

Cyclostomes, the living jawless vertebrates including hagfishes and lampreys,
represent the most basal lineage of vertebrates. Although the monophyly of
cyclostomes has been supported by recent molecular analyses, the phenotypic
traits of hagfishes, especially the lack of some vertebrate-defining features and
the reported endodermal origin of the adenohypophysis, have been interpreted as
hagfishes exhibiting a more ancestral state than those of all other vertebrates. 
Furthermore, the adult anatomy of hagfishes cannot be compared easily with that
of lampreys. Here we describe the craniofacial development of a series of staged 
hagfish embryos, which shows that their adenohypophysis arises ectodermally,
consistent with the molecular phylogenetic data. This finding also allowed us to 
identify a pan-cyclostome pattern, one not shared by jawed vertebrates.
Comparative analyses indicated that many of the hagfish-specific traits can be
explained by changes secondarily introduced into the hagfish lineage. We also
propose a possibility that the pan-cyclostome pattern may reflect the ancestral
programme for the craniofacial development of all living vertebrates.

A subset of ultraluminous X-ray sources (those with luminosities of less than
10(40) erg s(-1); ref. 1) are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto 
black holes with masses of ∼5-20M cicled dot, probably by means of an accretion
disk. The X-ray and radio emission are coupled in such Galactic sources; the
radio emission originates in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the
innermost regions near the black hole, with the most powerful emission occurring 
when the rate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the Eddington
limit). Only four such maximal sources are known in the Milky Way, and the
absorption of soft X-rays in the interstellar medium hinders the determination of
the causal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. Here we
report radio and X-ray observations of a bright new X-ray source in the nearby
galaxy M 31, whose peak luminosity exceeded 10(39) erg s(-1). The radio
luminosity is extremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of
minutes, arguing that the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close
to the Eddington limit onto a black hole of stellar mass. Continued radio and
X-ray monitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between
the accretion flow and the powerful jet emission.

Structure of the proton-gated urea channel from the gastric pathogen Helicobacter
pylori.

Half the world's population is chronically infected with Helicobacter pylori,
causing gastritis, gastric ulcers and an increased incidence of gastric
adenocarcinoma. Its proton-gated inner-membrane urea channel, HpUreI, is
essential for survival in the acidic environment of the stomach. The channel is
closed at neutral pH and opens at acidic pH to allow the rapid access of urea to 
cytoplasmic urease. Urease produces NH(3) and CO(2), neutralizing entering
protons and thus buffering the periplasm to a pH of roughly 6.1 even in gastric
juice at a pH below 2.0. Here we report the structure of HpUreI, revealing six
protomers assembled in a hexameric ring surrounding a central bilayer plug of
ordered lipids. Each protomer encloses a channel formed by a twisted bundle of
six transmembrane helices. The bundle defines a previously unobserved fold
comprising a two-helix hairpin motif repeated three times around the central axis
of the channel, without the inverted repeat of mammalian-type urea transporters. 
Both the channel and the protomer interface contain residues conserved in the
AmiS/UreI superfamily, suggesting the preservation of channel architecture and
oligomeric state in this superfamily. Predominantly aromatic or aliphatic side
chains line the entire channel and define two consecutive constriction sites in
the middle of the channel. Mutation of Trp 153 in the cytoplasmic constriction
site to Ala or Phe decreases the selectivity for urea in comparison with
thiourea, suggesting that solute interaction with Trp 153 contributes
specificity. The previously unobserved hexameric channel structure described here
provides a new model for the permeation of urea and other small amide solutes in 
prokaryotes and archaea.

Touch sensation is essential for behaviours ranging from environmental
exploration to social interaction; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely
unknown. In Drosophila larvae, two types of sensory neurons, class III and class 
IV dendritic arborization neurons, tile the body wall. The mechanotransduction
channel PIEZO in class IV neurons is essential for sensing noxious mechanical
stimuli but is not involved in gentle touch. On the basis of
electrophysiological-recording, calcium-imaging and behavioural studies, here we 
report that class III dendritic arborization neurons are touch sensitive and
contribute to gentle-touch sensation. We further identify NOMPC (No
mechanoreceptor potential C), a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) 
family of ion channels, as a mechanotransduction channel for gentle touch. NOMPC 
is highly expressed in class III neurons and is required for their
mechanotransduction. Moreover, ectopic NOMPC expression confers touch sensitivity
to the normally touch-insensitive class IV neurons. In addition to the critical
role of NOMPC in eliciting gentle-touch-mediated behavioural responses,
expression of this protein in the Drosophila S2 cell line also gives rise to
mechanosensitive channels in which ion selectivity can be altered by NOMPC
mutation, indicating that NOMPC is a pore-forming subunit of a
mechanotransduction channel. Our study establishes NOMPC as a bona fide
mechanotransduction channel that satisfies all four criteria proposed for a
channel to qualify as a transducer of mechanical stimuli and mediates
gentle-touch sensation. Our study also suggests that different mechanosensitive
channels may be used to sense gentle touch versus noxious mechanical stimuli.

Cellulose, the most abundant biological macromolecule, is an extracellular,
linear polymer of glucose molecules. It represents an essential component of
plant cell walls but is also found in algae and bacteria. In bacteria, cellulose 
production frequently correlates with the formation of biofilms, a sessile,
multicellular growth form. Cellulose synthesis and transport across the inner
bacterial membrane is mediated by a complex of the membrane-integrated catalytic 
BcsA subunit and the membrane-anchored, periplasmic BcsB protein. Here we present
the crystal structure of a complex of BcsA and BcsB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides 
containing a translocating polysaccharide. The structure of the BcsA-BcsB
translocation intermediate reveals the architecture of the cellulose synthase,
demonstrates how BcsA forms a cellulose-conducting channel, and suggests a model 
for the coupling of cellulose synthesis and translocation in which the nascent
polysaccharide is extended by one glucose molecule at a time.

Several of the thousands of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been
functionally characterized; however, potential roles for lncRNAs in somatic
tissue differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a 3.7-kilobase
lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal 
differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high
messenger RNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated
in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and
ELOVL3. TINCR-deficient epidermis lacked terminal differentiation ultrastructure,
including keratohyalin granules and intact lamellar bodies. Genome-scale RNA
interactome analysis revealed that TINCR interacts with a range of
differentiation mRNAs. TINCR-mRNA interaction occurs through a 25-nucleotide
'TINCR box' motif that is strongly enriched in interacting mRNAs and required for
TINCR binding. A high-throughput screen to analyse TINCR binding capacity to
approximately 9,400 human recombinant proteins revealed direct binding of TINCR
RNA to the staufen1 (STAU1) protein. STAU1-deficient tissue recapitulated the
impaired differentiation seen with TINCR depletion. Loss of UPF1 and UPF2, both
of which are required for STAU1-mediated RNA decay, however, did not have
differentiation effects. Instead, the TINCR-STAU1 complex seems to mediate
stabilization of differentiation mRNAs, such as KRT80. These data identify TINCR 
as a key lncRNA required for somatic tissue differentiation, which occurs through
lncRNA binding to differentiation mRNAs to ensure their expression.

Establishing the age of each mutation segregating in contemporary human
populations is important to fully understand our evolutionary history and will
help to facilitate the development of new approaches for disease-gene discovery. 
Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent
explosive population growth, notable for an excess of rare genetic variants,
suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the 
distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals
of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of
1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that
approximately 73% of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86% of SNVs
predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000-10,000 years. The average age
of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease
genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious 
SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of
deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African
Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa
dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human
protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the
burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide
important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in
disease-gene discovery.

Mechanisms controlling the proliferative activity of neural stem and progenitor
cells (NSPCs) have a pivotal role to ensure life-long neurogenesis in the
mammalian brain. How metabolic programs are coupled with NSPC activity remains
unknown. Here we show that fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the key enzyme of de novo 
lipogenesis, is highly active in adult NSPCs and that conditional deletion of
Fasn in mouse NSPCs impairs adult neurogenesis. The rate of de novo lipid
synthesis and subsequent proliferation of NSPCs is regulated by Spot14, a gene
previously implicated in lipid metabolism, that we found to be selectively
expressed in low proliferating adult NSPCs. Spot14 reduces the availability of
malonyl-CoA, which is an essential substrate for Fasn to fuel lipogenesis. Thus, 
we identify here a functional coupling between the regulation of lipid metabolism
and adult NSPC proliferation.

Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) or genomic alterations in
the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-signalling pathway are the most common
genetic alterations reported in human prostate cancer. However, the precise
mechanism underlying how indolent tumours with PTEN alterations acquire
metastatic potential remains poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that
upregulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signalling triggered by PTEN
loss will form a growth barrier as a defence mechanism to constrain prostate
cancer progression, underscoring that TGF-β signalling might represent a
pre-invasive checkpoint to prevent PTEN-mediated prostate tumorigenesis. Here we 
show that COUP transcription factor II (COUP-TFII, also known as NR2F2), a member
of the nuclear receptor superfamily, serves as a key regulator to inhibit
SMAD4-dependent transcription, and consequently overrides the TGF-β-dependent
checkpoint for PTEN-null indolent tumours. Overexpression of COUP-TFII in the
mouse prostate epithelium cooperates with PTEN deletion to augment malignant
progression and produce an aggressive metastasis-prone tumour. The functional
counteraction between COUP-TFII and SMAD4 is reinforced by genetically engineered
mouse models in which conditional loss of SMAD4 diminishes the inhibitory effects
elicited by COUP-TFII ablation. The biological significance of COUP-TFII in
prostate carcinogenesis is substantiated by patient sample analysis, in which
COUP-TFII expression or activity is tightly correlated with tumour recurrence and
disease progression, whereas it is inversely associated with TGF-β signalling.
These findings reveal that the destruction of the TGF-β-dependent barrier by
COUP-TFII is crucial for the progression of PTEN-mutant prostate cancer into a
life-threatening disease, and supports COUP-TFII as a potential drug target for
the intervention of metastatic human prostate cancer.

Recombination-restarted replication makes inverted chromosome fusions at inverted
repeats.

Impediments to DNA replication are known to induce gross chromosomal
rearrangements (GCRs) and copy-number variations (CNVs). GCRs and CNVs underlie
human genomic disorders and are a feature of cancer. During cancer development,
environmental factors and oncogene-driven proliferation promote replication
stress. Resulting GCRs and CNVs are proposed to contribute to cancer development 
and therapy resistance. When stress arrests replication, the replisome remains
associated with the fork DNA (stalled fork) and is protected by the inter-S-phase
checkpoint. Stalled forks efficiently resume when the stress is relieved.
However, if the polymerases dissociate from the fork (fork collapse) or the fork 
structure breaks (broken fork), replication restart can proceed either by
homologous recombination or microhomology-primed re-initiation. Here we ascertain
the consequences of replication with a fork restarted by homologous recombination
in fission yeast. We identify a new mechanism of chromosomal rearrangement
through the observation that recombination-restarted forks have a considerably
high propensity to execute a U-turn at small inverted repeats (up to 1 in 40
replication events). We propose that the error-prone nature of restarted forks
contributes to the generation of GCRs and gene amplification in cancer, and to
non-recurrent CNVs in genomic disorders.

Post-replicative repair involves separase-dependent removal of the kleisin
subunit of cohesin.

DNA double-strand break repair is critical for cell viability and involves highly
coordinated pathways to restore DNA integrity at the lesion. An early event
during homology-dependent repair is resection of the break to generate
progressively longer 3' single-strand tails that are used to identify suitable
templates for repair. Sister chromatids provide near-perfect sequence homology
and are therefore the preferred templates during homologous recombination. To
provide a bias for the use of sisters as donors, cohesin--the complex that
tethers sister chromatids together--is recruited to the break to enforce physical
proximity. Here we show that DNA breaks promote dissociation of cohesin loaded
during the previous S phase in budding yeast, and that damage-induced
dissociation of cohesin requires separase, the protease that dissolves cohesion
in anaphase. Moreover, a separase-resistant allele of the gene coding for the
α-kleisin subunit of cohesin, Mcd1 (also known as Scc1), reduces double-strand
break resection and compromises the efficiency of repair even when loaded during 
DNA damage. We conclude that post-replicative DNA repair involves cohesin
dissociation by separase to promote accessibility to repair factors during the
coordinated cellular response to restore DNA integrity.

The oxidation state of the mantle and the extraction of carbon from Earth's
interior.

Determining the oxygen fugacity of Earth's silicate mantle is of prime importance
because it affects the speciation and mobility of volatile elements in the
interior and has controlled the character of degassing species from the Earth
since the planet's formation. Oxygen fugacities recorded by garnet-bearing
peridotite xenoliths from Archaean lithosphere are of particular interest,
because they provide constraints on the nature of volatile-bearing metasomatic
fluids and melts active in the oldest mantle samples, including those in which
diamonds are found. Here we report the results of experiments to test garnet
oxythermobarometry equilibria under high-pressure conditions relevant to the
deepest mantle xenoliths. We present a formulation for the most successful
equilibrium and use it to determine an accurate picture of the oxygen fugacity
through cratonic lithosphere. The oxygen fugacity of the deepest rocks is found
to be at least one order of magnitude more oxidized than previously estimated. At
depths where diamonds can form, the oxygen fugacity is not compatible with the
stability of either carbonate- or methane-rich liquid but is instead compatible
with a metasomatic liquid poor in carbonate and dominated by either water or
silicate melt. The equilibrium also indicates that the relative oxygen fugacity
of garnet-bearing rocks will increase with decreasing depth during adiabatic
decompression. This implies that carbon in the asthenospheric mantle will be
hosted as graphite or diamond but will be oxidized to produce carbonate melt
through the reduction of Fe(3+) in silicate minerals during upwelling. The depth 
of carbonate melt formation will depend on the ratio of Fe(3+) to total iron in
the bulk rock. This 'redox melting' relationship has important implications for
the onset of geophysically detectable incipient melting and for the extraction of
carbon dioxide from the mantle through decompressive melting.

For more than a decade, the target of keeping global warming below 2 °C has been 
a key focus of the international climate debate. In response, the scientific
community has published a number of scenario studies that estimate the costs of
achieving such a target. Producing these estimates remains a challenge,
particularly because of relatively well known, but poorly quantified,
uncertainties, and owing to limited integration of scientific knowledge across
disciplines. The integrated assessment community, on the one hand, has
extensively assessed the influence of technological and socio-economic
uncertainties on low-carbon scenarios and associated costs. The climate modelling
community, on the other hand, has spent years improving its understanding of the 
geophysical response of the Earth system to emissions of greenhouse gases. This
geophysical response remains a key uncertainty in the cost of mitigation
scenarios but has been integrated with assessments of other uncertainties in only
a rudimentary manner, that is, for equilibrium conditions. Here we bridge this
gap between the two research communities by generating distributions of the costs
associated with limiting transient global temperature increase to below specific 
values, taking into account uncertainties in four factors: geophysical,
technological, social and political. We find that political choices that delay
mitigation have the largest effect on the cost-risk distribution, followed by
geophysical uncertainties, social factors influencing future energy demand and,
lastly, technological uncertainties surrounding the availability of greenhouse
gas mitigation options. Our information on temperature risk and mitigation costs 
provides crucial information for policy-making, because it clarifies the relative
importance of mitigation costs, energy demand and the timing of global action in 
reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature increase of 2 °C, or other
limits such as 3 °C or 1.5 °C, across a wide range of scenarios.

The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to harbour regions of intense star
formation activity as well as a supermassive black hole. Recent observations have
revealed regions of γ-ray emission reaching far above and below the Galactic
Centre (relative to the Galactic plane), the so-called 'Fermi bubbles'. It is
uncertain whether these were generated by nuclear star formation or by
quasar-like outbursts of the central black hole and no information on the
structures' magnetic field has been reported. Here we report observations of two 
giant, linearly polarized radio lobes, containing three ridge-like substructures,
emanating from the Galactic Centre. The lobes each extend about 60 degrees in the
Galactic bulge, closely corresponding to the Fermi bubbles, and are permeated by 
strong magnetic fields of up to 15 microgauss. We conclude that the radio lobes
originate in a biconical, star-formation-driven (rather than black-hole-driven)
outflow from the Galaxy's central 200 parsecs that transports a huge amount of
magnetic energy, about 10(55) ergs, into the Galactic halo. The ridges wind
around this outflow and, we suggest, constitute a 'phonographic' record of
nuclear star formation activity over at least ten million years.

Dwarf satellite galaxies are thought to be the remnants of the population of
primordial structures that coalesced to form giant galaxies like the Milky Way.
It has previously been suspected that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically
distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of H I
emission, and may form coplanar groups. These suspicions are supported by recent 
analyses. It has been claimed that the apparently planar distribution of
satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology, and cannot simply
represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute
this conclusion. Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites 
in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), comprising about half of the population. The
structure is at least 400 kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with 
a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1 kiloparsecs. Radial velocity
measurements reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of 
rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of
dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and
direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is
approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector
between the Milky Way and Andromeda.

Presenilin and signal peptide peptidase (SPP) are intramembrane aspartyl
proteases that regulate important biological functions in eukaryotes. Mechanistic
understanding of presenilin and SPP has been hampered by lack of relevant
structural information. Here we report the crystal structure of a presenilin/SPP 
homologue (PSH) from the archaeon Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1. The protease,
comprising nine transmembrane segments (TMs), adopts a previously unreported
protein fold. The amino-terminal domain, consisting of TM1-6, forms a
horseshoe-shaped structure, surrounding TM7-9 of the carboxy-terminal domain. The
two catalytic aspartate residues are located on the cytoplasmic side of TM6 and
TM7, spatially close to each other and approximately 8 Å into the lipid membrane 
surface. Water molecules gain constant access to the catalytic aspartates through
a large cavity between the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. Structural
analysis reveals insights into the presenilin/SPP family of intramembrane
proteases.

Developing a theoretical framework for conducting electronic fluids qualitatively
distinct from those described by Landau's Fermi-liquid theory is of central
importance to many outstanding problems in condensed matter physics. One such
problem is that, above the transition temperature and near optimal doping,
high-transition-temperature copper-oxide superconductors exhibit 'strange metal' 
behaviour that is inconsistent with being a traditional Landau Fermi liquid.
Indeed, a microscopic theory of a strange-metal quantum phase could shed new
light on the interesting low-temperature behaviour in the pseudogap regime and on
the d-wave superconductor itself. Here we present a theory for a specific example
of a strange metal--the 'd-wave metal'. Using variational wavefunctions, gauge
theoretic arguments, and ultimately large-scale density matrix renormalization
group calculations, we show that this remarkable quantum phase is the ground
state of a reasonable microscopic Hamiltonian--the usual t-J model with electron 
kinetic energy t and two-spin exchange J supplemented with a frustrated electron 
'ring-exchange' term, which we here examine extensively on the square lattice
two-leg ladder. These findings constitute an explicit theoretical example of a
genuine non-Fermi-liquid metal existing as the ground state of a realistic model.

A fundamental feature of embryonic patterning is the ability to scale and
maintain stable proportions despite changes in overall size, for instance during 
growth. A notable example occurs during vertebrate segment formation: after
experimental reduction of embryo size, segments form proportionally smaller, and 
consequently, a normal number of segments is formed. Despite decades of
experimental and theoretical work, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. More
recently, ultradian oscillations in gene activity have been linked to the
temporal control of segmentation; however, their implication in scaling remains
elusive. Here we show that scaling of gene oscillation dynamics underlies segment
scaling. To this end, we develop a new experimental model, an ex vivo primary
cell culture assay that recapitulates mouse mesoderm patterning and segment
scaling, in a quasi-monolayer of presomitic mesoderm cells (hereafter termed
monolayer PSM or mPSM). Combined with real-time imaging of gene activity, this
enabled us to quantify the gradual shift in the oscillation phase and thus
determine the resulting phase gradient across the mPSM. Crucially, we show that
this phase gradient scales by maintaining a fixed amplitude across mPSM of
different lengths. We identify the slope of this phase gradient as a single
predictive parameter for segment size, which functions in a size- and
temperature-independent manner, revealing a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for
scaling. Notably, in contrast to molecular gradients, a phase gradient describes 
the distribution of a dynamical cellular state. Thus, our phase-gradient scaling 
findings reveal a new level of dynamic information-processing, and provide
evidence for the concept of phase-gradient encoding during embryonic patterning
and scaling.

Pore-forming toxins are critical virulence factors for many bacterial pathogens
and are central to Staphylococcus aureus-mediated killing of host cells. S.
aureus encodes pore-forming bi-component leukotoxins that are toxic towards
neutrophils, but also specifically target other immune cells. Despite decades
since the first description of staphylococcal leukocidal activity, the host
factors responsible for the selectivity of leukotoxins towards different immune
cells remain unknown. Here we identify the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
co-receptor CCR5 as a cellular determinant required for cytotoxic targeting of
subsets of myeloid cells and T lymphocytes by the S. aureus leukotoxin ED
(LukED). We further demonstrate that LukED-dependent cell killing is blocked by
CCR5 receptor antagonists, including the HIV drug maraviroc. Remarkably,
CCR5-deficient mice are largely resistant to lethal S. aureus infection,
highlighting the importance of CCR5 targeting in S. aureus pathogenesis. Thus,
depletion of CCR5(+) leukocytes by LukED suggests a new immune evasion mechanism 
of S. aureus that can be therapeutically targeted.

Ediacaran (635-542 million years ago) fossils have been regarded as early animal 
ancestors of the Cambrian evolutionary explosion of marine invertebrate phyla, as
giant marine protists and as lichenized fungi. Recent documentation of palaeosols
in the Ediacara Member of the Rawnsley Quartzite of South Australia confirms past
interpretations of lagoonal-aeolian deposition based on synsedimentary
ferruginization and loessic texture. Further evidence for palaeosols comes from
non-marine facies, dilation cracks, soil nodules, sand crystals, stable isotopic 
data and mass balance geochemistry. Here I show that the uppermost surfaces of
the palaeosols have a variety of fossils in growth position, including
Charniodiscus, Dickinsonia, Hallidaya, Parvancorina, Phyllozoon, Praecambridium, 
Rugoconites, Tribrachidium and 'old-elephant skin' (ichnogenus Rivularites).
These fossils were preserved as ferruginous impressions, like plant fossils, and 
biological soil crusts of Phanerozoic eon sandy palaeosols. Sand crystals after
gypsum and nodules of carbonate are shallow within the palaeosols, even after
correcting for burial compaction. Periglacial involutions and modest geochemical 
differentiation of the palaeosols are evidence of a dry, cold temperate Ediacaran
palaeoclimate in South Australia. This new interpretation of some Ediacaran
fossils as large sessile organisms of cool, dry soils, is compatible with
observations that Ediacaran fossils were similar in appearance and preservation
to lichens and other microbial colonies of biological soil crusts, rather than
marine animals, or protists.

Whereas large-scale efforts have rapidly advanced the understanding and practical
impact of human genomic variation, the practical impact of variation is largely
unexplored in the human microbiome. We therefore developed a framework for
metagenomic variation analysis and applied it to 252 faecal metagenomes of 207
individuals from Europe and North America. Using 7.4 billion reads aligned to 101
reference species, we detected 10.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), 107,991 short insertions/deletions, and 1,051 structural variants. The
average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism rates of 0.11 was more
variable between gut microbial species than across human hosts. Subjects sampled 
at varying time intervals exhibited individuality and temporal stability of SNP
variation patterns, despite considerable composition changes of their gut
microbiota. This indicates that individual-specific strains are not easily
replaced and that an individual might have a unique metagenomic genotype, which
may be exploitable for personalized diet or drug intake.

The time it takes to switch on and off electric current determines the rate at
which signals can be processed and sampled in modern information technology.
Field-effect transistors are able to control currents at frequencies of the order
of or higher than 100 gigahertz, but electric interconnects may hamper progress
towards reaching the terahertz (10(12) hertz) range. All-optical injection of
currents through interfering photoexcitation pathways or photoconductive
switching of terahertz transients has made it possible to control electric
current on a subpicosecond timescale in semiconductors. Insulators have been
deemed unsuitable for both methods, because of the need for either ultraviolet
light or strong fields, which induce slow damage or ultrafast breakdown,
respectively. Here we report the feasibility of electric signal manipulation in a
dielectric. A few-cycle optical waveform reversibly increases--free from
breakdown--the a.c. conductivity of amorphous silicon dioxide (fused silica) by
more than 18 orders of magnitude within 1 femtosecond, allowing electric currents
to be driven, directed and switched by the instantaneous light field. Our work
opens the way to extending electronic signal processing and high-speed metrology 
into the petahertz (10(15) hertz) domain.

The control of the electric and optical properties of semiconductors with
microwave fields forms the basis of modern electronics, information processing
and optical communications. The extension of such control to optical frequencies 
calls for wideband materials such as dielectrics, which require strong electric
fields to alter their physical properties. Few-cycle laser pulses permit
damage-free exposure of dielectrics to electric fields of several volts per
ångström and significant modifications in their electronic system. Fields of such
strength and temporal confinement can turn a dielectric from an insulating state 
to a conducting state within the optical period. However, to extend electric
signal control and processing to light frequencies depends on the feasibility of 
reversing these effects approximately as fast as they can be induced. Here we
study the underlying electron processes with sub-femtosecond solid-state
spectroscopy, which reveals the feasibility of manipulating the electronic
structure and electric polarizability of a dielectric reversibly with the
electric field of light. We irradiate a dielectric (fused silica) with a
waveform-controlled near-infrared few-cycle light field of several volts per
angström and probe changes in extreme-ultraviolet absorptivity and near-infrared 
reflectivity on a timescale of approximately a hundred attoseconds to a few
femtoseconds. The field-induced changes follow, in a highly nonlinear fashion,
the turn-on and turn-off behaviour of the driving field, in agreement with the
predictions of a quantum mechanical model. The ultrafast reversibility of the
effects implies that the physical properties of a dielectric can be controlled
with the electric field of light, offering the potential for petahertz-bandwidth 
signal manipulation.

lipids.

Ionic protein-lipid interactions are critical for the structure and function of
membrane receptors, ion channels, integrins and many other proteins. However, the
regulatory mechanism of these interactions is largely unknown. Here we show that 
Ca(2+) can bind directly to anionic phospholipids and thus modulate membrane
protein function. The activation of T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex (TCR), a 
key membrane receptor for adaptive immunity, is regulated by ionic interactions
between positively charged CD3ε/ζ cytoplasmic domains (CD3(CD)) and negatively
charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane. Crucial tyrosines are buried in the
membrane and are largely protected from phosphorylation in resting T cells. It is
not clear how CD3(CD) dissociates from the membrane in antigen-stimulated T
cells. The antigen engagement of even a single TCR triggers a Ca(2+) influx and
TCR-proximal Ca(2+) concentration is higher than the average cytosolic Ca(2+)
concentration. Our biochemical, live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
and NMR experiments showed that an increase in Ca(2+) concentration induced the
dissociation of CD3(CD) from the membrane and the solvent exposure of tyrosine
residues. As a consequence, CD3 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly
enhanced by Ca(2+) influx. Moreover, when compared with wild-type cells, Ca(2+)
channel-deficient T cells had substantially lower levels of CD3 phosphorylation
after stimulation. The effect of Ca(2+) on facilitating CD3 phosphorylation is
primarily due to the charge of this ion, as demonstrated by the fact that
replacing Ca(2+) with the non-physiological ion Sr(2+) resulted in the same
feedback effect. Finally, (31)P NMR spectroscopy showed that Ca(2+) bound to the 
phosphate group in anionic phospholipids at physiological concentrations, thus
neutralizing the negative charge of phospholipids. Rather than initiating CD3
phosphorylation, this regulatory pathway of Ca(2+) has a positive feedback effect
on amplifying and sustaining CD3 phosphorylation and should enhance T-cell
sensitivity to foreign antigens. Our study thus provides a new regulatory
mechanism of Ca(2+) to T-cell activation involving direct lipid manipulation.

A remarkable feature of regenerative processes is their ability to halt
proliferation once an organ's structure has been restored. The Wnt signalling
pathway is the major driving force for homeostatic self-renewal and regeneration 
in the mammalian intestine. However, the mechanisms that counterbalance
Wnt-driven proliferation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in mice and
humans that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP; also known as YAP1)--a protein known
for its powerful growth-inducing and oncogenic properties--has an unexpected
growth-suppressive function, restricting Wnt signals during intestinal
regeneration. Transgenic expression of YAP reduces Wnt target gene expression and
results in the rapid loss of intestinal crypts. In addition, loss of YAP results 
in Wnt hypersensitivity during regeneration, leading to hyperplasia, expansion of
intestinal stem cells and niche cells, and formation of ectopic crypts and
microadenomas. We find that cytoplasmic YAP restricts elevated Wnt signalling
independently of the AXIN-APC-GSK-3β complex partly by limiting the activity of
dishevelled (DVL). DVL signals in the nucleus of intestinal stem cells, and its
forced expression leads to enhanced Wnt signalling in crypts. YAP dampens Wnt
signals by restricting DVL nuclear translocation during regenerative growth.
Finally, we provide evidence that YAP is silenced in a subset of highly
aggressive and undifferentiated human colorectal carcinomas, and that its
expression can restrict the growth of colorectal carcinoma xenografts.
Collectively, our work describes a novel mechanistic paradigm for how
proliferative signals are counterbalanced in regenerating tissues. Additionally, 
our findings have important implications for the targeting of YAP in human
malignancies.

Upon environmental changes or extracellular signals, cells are subjected to
marked changes in gene expression. Dealing with high levels of transcription
during replication is critical to prevent collisions between the transcription
and replication pathways and avoid recombination events. In response to
osmostress, hundreds of stress-responsive genes are rapidly induced by the
stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) Hog1 (ref. 6), even during S phase. Here
we show in Saccharomyces cerevisae that a single signalling molecule, Hog1,
coordinates both replication and transcription upon osmostress. Hog1 interacts
with and phosphorylates Mrc1, a component of the replication complex.
Phosphorylation occurs at different sites to those targeted by Mec1 upon DNA
damage. Mrc1 phosphorylation by Hog1 delays early and late origin firing by
preventing Cdc45 loading, as well as slowing down replication-complex
progression. Regulation of Mrc1 by Hog1 is completely independent of Mec1 and
Rad53. Cells carrying a non-phosphorylatable allele of MRC1 (mrc1(3A)) do not
delay replication upon stress and show a marked increase in
transcription-associated recombination, genomic instability and Rad52 foci. In
contrast, mrc1(3A) induces Rad53 and survival in the presence of hydroxyurea or
methyl methanesulphonate. Therefore, Hog1 and Mrc1 define a novel S-phase
checkpoint independent of the DNA-damage checkpoint that permits eukaryotic cells
to prevent conflicts between DNA replication and transcription, which would
otherwise lead to genomic instability when both phenomena are temporally
coincident.

Convergent acoustic field of view in echolocating bats.

Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.

Most echolocating bats exhibit a strong correlation between body size and the
frequency of maximum energy in their echolocation calls (peak frequency), with
smaller species using signals of higher frequency than larger ones. Size-signal
allometry or acoustic detection constraints imposed on wavelength by preferred
prey size have been used to explain this relationship. Here we propose the
hypothesis that smaller bats emit higher frequencies to achieve directional sonar
beams, and that variable beam width is critical for bats. Shorter wavelengths
relative to the size of the emitter translate into more directional sound beams. 
Therefore, bats that emit their calls through their mouths should show a
relationship between mouth size and wavelength, driving smaller bats to signals
of higher frequency. We found that in a flight room mimicking a closed habitat,
six aerial hawking vespertilionid species (ranging in size from 4 to 21 g, ref.
5) produced sonar beams of extraordinarily similar shape and volume. Each species
had a directivity index of 11 ± 1 dB (a half-amplitude angle of approximately
37°) and an on-axis sound level of 108 ± 4 dB sound pressure level referenced to 
20 μPa root mean square at 10 cm. Thus all bats adapted their calls to achieve
similar acoustic fields of view. We propose that the necessity for high
directionality has been a key constraint on the evolution of echolocation, which 
explains the relationship between bat size and echolocation call frequency. Our
results suggest that echolocation is a dynamic system that allows different
species, regardless of their body size, to converge on optimal fields of view in 
response to habitat and task.

The activity of the cerebral cortex is thought to depend on the precise
relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition. In the visual cortex, in
particular, intracellular measurements have related response selectivity to
coordinated increases in excitation and inhibition. These measurements, however, 
have all been made during anaesthesia, which strongly influences cortical state
and therefore sensory processing. The synaptic activity that is evoked by visual 
stimulation during wakefulness is unknown. Here we measured visually evoked
responses--and the underlying synaptic conductances--in the visual cortex of
anaesthetized and awake mice. Under anaesthesia, responses could be elicited from
a large region of visual space and were prolonged. During wakefulness, responses 
were more spatially selective and much briefer. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
of synaptic conductances showed a difference in synaptic inhibition between the
two conditions. Under anaesthesia, inhibition tracked excitation in amplitude and
spatial selectivity. By contrast, during wakefulness, inhibition was much
stronger than excitation and had extremely broad spatial selectivity. We conclude
that during wakefulness, cortical responses to visual stimulation are dominated
by synaptic inhibition, restricting the spatial spread and temporal persistence
of neural activity. These results provide a direct glimpse of synaptic mechanisms
that control sensory responses in the awake cortex.

DNA-repair scaffolds dampen checkpoint signalling by counteracting the adaptor

In response to genotoxic stress, a transient arrest in cell-cycle progression
enforced by the DNA-damage checkpoint (DDC) signalling pathway positively
contributes to genome maintenance. Because hyperactivated DDC signalling can lead
to a persistent and detrimental cell-cycle arrest, cells must tightly regulate
the activity of the kinases involved in this pathway. Despite their importance,
the mechanisms for monitoring and modulating DDC signalling are not fully
understood. Here we show that the DNA-repair scaffolding proteins Slx4 and Rtt107
prevent the aberrant hyperactivation of DDC signalling by lesions that are
generated during DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On replication
stress, cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 show hyperactivation of the downstream DDC
kinase Rad53, whereas activation of the upstream DDC kinase Mec1 remains normal. 
An Slx4-Rtt107 complex counteracts the checkpoint adaptor Rad9 by physically
interacting with Dpb11 and phosphorylated histone H2A, two positive regulators of
Rad9-dependent Rad53 activation. A decrease in DDC signalling results from
hypomorphic mutations in RAD53 and H2A and rescues the hypersensitivity to
replication stress of cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107. We propose that the
Slx4-Rtt107 complex modulates Rad53 activation by a competition-based mechanism
that balances the engagement of Rad9 at replication-induced lesions. Our findings
show that DDC signalling is monitored and modulated through the direct action of 
DNA-repair factors.
