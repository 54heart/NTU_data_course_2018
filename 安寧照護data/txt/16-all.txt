[Active Problems]
1.	Acute liver failure complicated with hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy, suspect hepatitis B related, r/o drug-induced hepatitis related
2.	Chronic Hepatitis B with acute flare up
3.	Pulmonary tuberculosis, status post anti-TB agents from 2014/11/06 to 2015/02/16
4.	Acute on chronic kidney disease, susp. Sepsis, GIB, and hepatorenal syndrome, s/p emergent H/D 3/4-3/6 then QW 135, dry BW 65kg
5.	Suspect hospital acquired pneumonia

[Inactive Problems]
6.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled (HbA1c>12%)
7.	Coronary artery disease, three-vessel disease status post POBAS, status post CABG in Oct. 2011
8.	Ventricular tachycardia status post intracardial defibrillator implantation in Nov. 2011
9.	Allopurinol allergy (HLA-B*5801 positive)

Treatment 3/2-3/7
    Rasitol pump was administered due to minimal urine output and progressive pulmonary edmeao on CXR. Deteriorated renal function was also noted so we consulted nephrologist for  hemodialysis on 3/4, 3/5, 3/6, then QW135 with titration. NG coffee ground and intermittent bradycardia were note on 3/3. We gave IV PPI and NPO first. Follow up cardiac enzymes was CK/MB/TnI:224/21/1.19 and ECG showed no dynamic changes.      Although NSTEMI was likely but DAPT and heparinization was held due to active bleeding. We contact CV林俊立 and pacemaker service and rate adjustment(40/130->70/110ppm) was done.
    New breakthrough fever occurred on 3/4 so Cefepime was upgraded to Meropenam + Fluconazole. Followed CXR disclosed imroved pulmonary edema. Liver function showed persistent elevated total bilirubin with low AFP < 2, representing poor liver regeneration and outcome.


<Plan>
1.	keep Entecavir for hepatitis B
2.	Maintenance hemodialysis QW135
3.	Inform grave prognosis of hepatic failure
4.	DNR was confirmed. (不電不壓)
6.	Keep Mepem/Diflucan and pursue culture result
7.      f/u HBV viral load on next W1 3/9g
