Suggeset

-> aggressive fluid challenge for acute pancreatitis
-> broadspectrum antibiotic for coverage of IAI and CAP
-> start CVVH for severe metabolic acidosis
-> TPN support
-> correlct electrolyte imbalance
-> inform family critical condtions and further treatment plan
VSD
Schizophrenia
Pancreatitis
Review drug history and alcohol
Arrange heart echo
Keep on current antibiotics
Pursue culture result
ICH history.
Seizure today, Phenytoin use, follow serum level.
Continue feeding trial.

Suggeset

-> high risk of fungal infectiion
-> CT showed acute pancreatitis with suspected local fluid accumulation, consider diagnositci paracentesis
-> adrenal insufficiency under stress dose steroid infusion
-> consult radiologist for possible NJ insertion
-> broadspectrum antibiotic for coverage of IAI

Suggeset

-> consciousness drowsy but arousable, adjust antiphychotic drug
-> O2 demnd stationary, intermittent ih atrovent improved sputum amount
-> CXR stationary, no new pneumonic patch
-> aggressvie chest care
-> NG feeding OK
-> adrenal insufficiency under stress dose steroid infusion, taper dosage, switch to oral steroid, goal taper off steroid
-> intermittent RRT for toxin removal
-> contact ward CR
-> inform family critical condtions and further treatment plan
Brief Summary of this week
On 2015/03/14-2015/03/20
Due to the tarry stool, the NPO was started with IVF supplements. An event of bradycardia and incrased oxygen demand noted on 2015/03/19 early morning. The lab showed improved leukocytosis, low level of lactic acid and no metabolic acidosis. He furhter developed cold sweats with hypothermia, so the hot lamp was used.  The possibility of rapid downhill was explained to his family members. The CXR showed mild RLL infiltration and cardiomegaly. The diuretics dosages were increased for suspicous of pulmonary edema related increased oxygen demand to oxygen mask 35% 8%L. 
Due to no hemoglobin loss and no more tarry stool, the water ingestion was tried but failed with further NG coffee ground substance. Therefore, the NPO was kept. The right IJV CVC was inserted smoothly on 2015/03/20 for TPN use.
